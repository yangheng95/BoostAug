dr. goldberg offers everything i look for in a general practitioner.  he's nice and easy to talk to without being patronizing; he's always on time in seeing his patients; he's affiliated with a top-notch hospital (nyu) which my parents have explained to me is very important in case something happens and you need surgery; and you can get referrals to see specialists without having to see him first.  really$LABEL$5
Unfortunately$LABEL$2
Been going to Dr. Goldberg for over 10 years. I think I was one of his 1st patients when he started at MHMG. He's been great over the years and is really all about the big picture. It is because of him$LABEL$4
Got a letter in the mail last week that said Dr. Goldberg is moving to Arizona to take a new position there in June.  He will be missed very much.  I think finding a new doctor in NYC that you actually like might almost be as awful as trying to find a date!$LABEL$4
I don't know what Dr. Goldberg was like before  moving to Arizona$LABEL$1
Top notch doctor in a top notch practice. Can't say I am surprised when I was referred to him by another doctor who I think is wonderful and because he went to one of the best medical schools in the country. It is really easy to get an appointment. There is minimal wait to be seen and his bedside manner is great.$LABEL$5
Dr. Eric Goldberg is a fantastic doctor who has correctly diagnosed every issue that my wife and I have had. Unlike many of my past doctors$LABEL$5
I'm writing this review to give you a heads up before you see this Doctor. The office staff and administration are very unprofessional. I left a message with multiple people regarding my bill$LABEL$1
Wing sauce is like water. Pretty much a lot of butter and some hot sauce (franks red hot maybe).  The whole wings are good size and crispy$LABEL$2
Decent range somewhat close to the city.  The mats are pretty solid; however$LABEL$3
Owning a driving range inside the city limits is like a license to print money.  I don't think I ask much out of a driving range.  Decent mats$LABEL$1
This place is absolute garbage...  Half of the tees are not available$LABEL$1
I drove by yesterday to get a sneak peak.  It re-opens on July 14th and I can't wait to take my kids.  The new range looks amazing.  The entire range appears to be turf$LABEL$4
After waiting for almost 30 minutes to trade in an old phone part of the buy back program$LABEL$2
This place was DELICIOUS!!  My parents saw a recommendation to visit this place from Rick Sebak's \""25 Things I Like About Pittsburgh\"" and he's usually pretty accurate.  His recommendations were to try the Reuben$LABEL$5
Can't miss stop for the best Fish Sandwich in Pittsburgh.$LABEL$5
This place should have a lot more reviews - but I'm glad it doesn't$LABEL$5
Old school.....traditional \""mom 'n pop\"" quality and perfection. The best fish and chips you'll ever enjoy and equally superb fried shrimp. A great out of the way$LABEL$5
Good fish sandwich.$LABEL$5
After a morning of Thrift Store hunting$LABEL$5
A great townie bar with tasty food and an interesting clientele. I went to check this place out on the way home from the airport one Friday night and it didn't disappoint. It is refreshing to walk into a townie bar and not feel like the music stops and everyone in the place is staring at you - I'm guessing the mixed crowd of older hockey fans$LABEL$4
Good beer selection. Understaffed for a light Monday night crowd$LABEL$3
Very disappointed in the customer service. We ordered Reuben's  and wanted coleslaw instead of kraut. They charged us $3.00 for the coleslaw. We will not be back . The iced tea is also terrible tasting.$LABEL$2
Let there be no question: Alexions owns the best cheeseburger in the region and they have now for decades. Try a burger on Italian bread. The service is flawlessly friendly$LABEL$5
Used to go there for tires$LABEL$1
Terrible. Preordered my tires and when I arrived they couldn't find the order anywhere. Once we got through that process I waited over 2 hours for them to be put on... I was originally told it would take 30 mins. Slow$LABEL$1
Last summer I had an appointment to get new tires and had to wait a super long time. I also went in this week for them to fix a minor problem with a tire they put on. They \""fixed\"" it for free$LABEL$1
I will start by saying we have a nice new deck. That is where the good part ends.Why two stars if we have a nice deck now? Well$LABEL$2
Hoofah.$LABEL$2
I heart King's. I've always been a fan and this one was as good as my old one in Monaca.$LABEL$4
Average run of the mill store.  Associates are young teens and they really don't know where anything is.  Luckily I am able to get around to find everything.  Found my puppy treats and moved on.$LABEL$2
Two meals$LABEL$2
Rocky's has been in business since the 1980s and still going strong.  Their food is good.  Not haute cuisine$LABEL$4
If you want a true understanding of Pittsburgh in the morning$LABEL$3
Cheap$LABEL$5
I miss this place. When I return home to pittsburgh this is always a must to ease myself into a saturday morning recovery after getting banged up on cheap south side cocktails the night before. When I think of pittsburgh$LABEL$4
Love this place.  Never had a bad meal.  Good portions and great people.  Be ready to stand in line.$LABEL$5
OK$LABEL$3
BEST DINER IN THE COUNRTY!!! We've been to many famous diners across the country and we still give  Gab and Eat the best rating !! I was a little intimidated when I first walked in and there was like 2 pounds of butter just sitting on top of the homefires on the grill.  If you are looking for a healthy breakfast they probably can accomodate you$LABEL$5
Great breakfast$LABEL$4
I always love a good diner.  Gab and Eat was just what we were looking for on a Saturday morning.  Good food.  Great people. Pittsburgh ambiance. This place is obviously a beloved neighborhood gem.  I had french toast and bacon.  The french toast was made with the best Italian bread.  My fiance had what they called a 'mixed grill.\""  It consisted of eggs$LABEL$5
I have been coming to Gab n Eat for almost 20 years and They have never let me down. I get a typical breakfast if eggs$LABEL$5
What a find! I stopped in here for breakfast while in town for business. The service is so friendly I thought I was down south. The service was quick$LABEL$5
Great little place. Treats you like a local.Eaten here 3 times a week for a month.  Same overtime. Barb is always here.$LABEL$5
My first time going to Barb's Country Junction and I really wanted to like this place$LABEL$2
My husband and I tried this place for the first time today. It was easy to find and no problems with parking. It's \""Seat Yourself\$LABEL$3
Tonya is super sweet and the front desk people are very helpful$LABEL$5
If I could give this place less than one star$LABEL$1
Best Irish food in the Burgh.  Great bar food too.  The service is maybe a bit surly and it's not the cleanest$LABEL$4
Okay$LABEL$2
The delivery driver mistakenly rang my doorbell$LABEL$1
3/6/12  visit -  i am from san francisco bay area and if u want a dive go to china town in san francisco. - this place was dirty like chinatown dive but some of the best food i have every tasted came from a dive. the food was really good and my group ordered a bunch of different things it was all good- a- taste.- prices are reasonable a-. --------they dont speak english very good and got my order wrong.sweet potatoe fries a+pizza  - aeggplant hoagie b+greek salad b+gyro a+if they scrubbed the place down and the lady spoke better english 4 star ****$LABEL$3
Some of the worst pizza I've ever had.  We used a coupon from the paper for a 2 topping 8 cut Sicilian. First of all the pizza wasn't even cut through$LABEL$1
I needed alterations done to my suit very quickly. Like three days quickly. Not only did Filberto at Alteration World have it ready$LABEL$5
Are you are really looking at the review for LJS?  Its fried stuff$LABEL$3
I agree with Paul on this one. But I had to stop here on my way home from work tonight. (I think I feel my heart yelling at me again)$LABEL$3
By far the worst most unprofessional dentist I have ever experienced her staff is too busy watching soap operas on all the TVs in each room instead of cleaning and she gave me a filling which was too deep which could have been understandable as her son had his pictures delivered from Hawaii and she had to stop 3 times to pay for them and show her whole staff all of them must be nice to have a 14 year old go to Hawaii on her moms dime and have her patience wait to see all of this happen I had to have oral surgery and have the tooth removed because she put the filling in too deep an abscessed tooth was the result I wouldn't recommend her to an ex girlfriend or someone I hate because of the three months of extreme tooth pain I had to deal with because of her lack of care and follow through even after I called and asked them for advice and follow up they simply could care less and did not even offer to reschedule an appointment other than prescribing me vicodin and antibiotics do not recommend and do not go to her license should be pulled!!$LABEL$1
When I moved to the area$LABEL$4
In all fairness - I did not see this dentist but did schedule an appointment and waited 15 minutes for them to open.When I look at Yelp reviews$LABEL$1
I've been to this office a good amount of times.  Each time the receptionists give of a vibe of entitlement and it is very uncomfortable.  Dr. Weinberg herself is very nice$LABEL$1
Don Don is a restaurant I find myself missing now and again$LABEL$3
Take it from me; avoid this place at all cost.  The only time I go is when I am starved and don't have the energy to cook or get edible food.  And then after I have been kicking myself.$LABEL$1
Far away from real Chinese food. Doesn't even taste good as American style Chinese food.$LABEL$2
I used to order takeout here once every month or so. The food tastes average and the price is good. It's your typical low-end Chinese place. The last (and final) time I ordered here I just so happened to be picking up my order while a health inspector from allegheny county health department was making his rounds. While I was waiting on my food (which took much longer than usual) the inspector was pointing out violations. He also requested a copy of a certificate that the man behind the register was unable to produce. The inspector looked at me like I was crazy for waiting on my food despite the obvious poor conditions.  As for the rest of the place - it's always been kind of dirty inside. The carpets are just FILTHY and the walls match. There are always children's toys scattered about the floor because the owners children are always there$LABEL$2
We went on a weeknight.  Place was not busy waited over 20 minutes for drinks and to have our order taken.  We ordered an app and it came out with the meals and that was another 20 minutes or so.  Food was luke warm at best.  I would not go back.$LABEL$1
This location never disappoints!! Food is always consistently great$LABEL$5
I belong to this gym...  I live in the South section of Pittsburgh$LABEL$4
I bought a three month membership last year$LABEL$2
If you like being greeted in the morning by a gym worker slopping down eggs from a frying pany instead of working....this is your gym....complain to the manager and she gets nasty....try getting in touch with the owner....impossible!  Most unprofessional gym ever!!!!$LABEL$1
I brought my husband and my parents all to Papa J's last time my husband and I were in Pittsburgh. My parents are really picky about their italian food$LABEL$5
I've been to Papa J's twice and had mixed experiences.Both times I had the banana pepper appetizer$LABEL$3
What a wonderful surprise found in Carnegie PA$LABEL$5
Yay$LABEL$4
Terrible service.  Food unremarkable.  Waiter disappeared for 45 minutes to serve larger group due to staffing mismanagement.  Saved his tip by discounting meal after I complained.  All and all$LABEL$1
Yay$LABEL$4
OK$LABEL$4
Great little gem! The food was fantastic was very food and just the right price. The Italian food was amazing$LABEL$4
I have to say that I write this review with much regret$LABEL$2
san francisco california visitor liked the food and the local is great. I am thinking about relocating to pttsbrgh area. I liked Carnegie because u can stroll down Main street and hit a couple places for lunch. I imagine this place would be crazy busy on friday or saturday night. we ate a lunchtime and it was nice.$LABEL$4
Coming here you get the feeling they haven't changed much.  The tables$LABEL$2
Had dinner at Papa J's with a group of 6.  I loved how the restaurant is in a old brick building with large windows. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. On a Saturday night$LABEL$3
Service in this place is poor because of lack of acknowledgment since people working there are \""just\"" working . They have nice decor$LABEL$2
Terrible service...terrible food...this place smells like rotten wet wood$LABEL$1
Although the first impression through the door is charming and the aroma enticing  as you enter this restaurant- much can be improved upon for the prices asked for the dining experience. Our group of 7 had called a week ahead and were seated in the back of the far dining room$LABEL$2
Papa J's is expensive and inconsistent.  The ambiance is nice but it doesn't justify the prices.  There are better restaurants in Carnegie.$LABEL$2
I was pleasantly surprised by this restaurant.  Came here with no expectations.  I was greeted by a large open (garage style) window$LABEL$4
Absolutely Awful Service.  Went to Papa J's awhile ago and the service was bad - the waiter was surly$LABEL$1
Service was great. Apps delish$LABEL$3
I love this place! The food is always so fresh and delicious. The staff is always friendly$LABEL$5
spinach/feta cheese salad:  B-pesto alfredo penne :  :A+Coconut Cake huge piece:  A+bread small portions:  BService B host seemed grumpy$LABEL$4
It was just what we were looking for. The service was great. My husband had the veal sausage on green pepper appetizer in the larger size. It was great (spicy) and enough for a meal. I had the stuffed eggplant. That was very good but the sauce could have been a bit heartier. I would definitely go back. Really nice atmosphere and free parking in the back.$LABEL$5
We stopped at Papa J's last Friday night (8/1) for a round of drinks. There were 7 of us altogether and we had eaten at another restaurant earlier in the evening.  One member of our party walked up to the bar to let them know we were sitting on the couches along the wall$LABEL$1
Some of the best chow around--love this place. The bread and salads and soups are great.$LABEL$5
Finally$LABEL$5
Man has this place gone down hill.  My husband and I went a couple of weeks ago.  We had salads and pasta.  Both were on the verge of inedible.  With a single glass of wine$LABEL$2
Talk about overpriced. $18 for a fairly basic pasta with some obviously frozen chicken chopped up over it. The latter was terrible$LABEL$3
I've decided where I stand with Emmert Dental. They are unprofessional$LABEL$1
THE WORST DENTAL EXPERIENCE OF MY LIFE.  THEY ARE BUTCHERS!  My husband and I went to Emmert Dental in Bethel Park for a routine cleaning and check up.  I had one tooth that I had a recent root canal on and a few small cavities that needed filled.  After the so called dentist - Dr Carnavali - did my exam$LABEL$1
The worst dental office I ever been. No one can beat it!!! You should avoid it at any time.$LABEL$1
Eat at your own risk. The service is terrible$LABEL$1
My expectations for McDonalds are t rarely high. But for one to still fail so spectacularly...that takes something special!The cashier took my friends's order$LABEL$1
I've tried to give this McDonalds a chance but my patience has run out. The only reason why I came here as much as I did is because I like the $1 iced coffees. But it's not even worth it. This McDonalds is poo and so is most of the staff. Whenever I want to go through the drive-thru I can't because there is a line of cars wrapped half away around the building. And even when the line is shorter there's always a hold up of some sort. So most of the time I just park and go inside the restaurant. Today was a horrible day. I ordered an iced coffee (no cream or sugar) and a chocolate chip cookie. It only takes 30 seconds to fill a cup with coffee and 30 seconds to take a cookie out of the case. I waited 10 minutes!! Sorry but that's too long just to get a coffee and a cookie! It's not like I ordered a meal! During that time I saw people come in after me and get their milkshakes and iced coffees within two minutes! WTH?! I told the petite sleepy eyed cashier I wanted my money back! Her eyes opened wide in surprise$LABEL$1
This McDonald's is so bad it's amazing.  Order:  Big mac$LABEL$1
We had the worst possible experience at the Eat N Park at Waterfront on 2/12/10 at around 10pm. Our waitress (Annemarie) was inattentive and got us the wrong order. We ended up with a dish we had not even ordered and still got charged for it on the check. One of my friends ordered a Buffalo Chicken Sandwich$LABEL$1
They burned my fish and they burned it bad.  Ordering fish at Eat'n Park is always a gamble.  I just never know how it's going to turn out.  I'm a risk taker so I ordered two pieces of baked lemon sole. Well it went terribly wrong.  My waiter came out and said$LABEL$3
Some how even though the food at this Eat'n Park is down right abominable$LABEL$2
Mmm...peppermint mochaIn my quest to visit every Starbucks in the USA I have stopped at yet another location.  This one is located in the center of a circle road -- very cache and in a newer part of the area.$LABEL$3
If there was ever a \""get your coffee and go\"" Starbucks$LABEL$2
I just realized they remodeled this one recently-ish. Well$LABEL$3
Great location!  Close to shops and theatre.  Nice staff.$LABEL$5
This Starbucks is teeny-tiny!Seating inside is VERY limited.  This is a Starbucks to grab and go and continue your shopping at the Waterfront.Baristas are friendly and fast.$LABEL$2
As far as Starbucks go$LABEL$3
I'm not a huge fan of this location. I think that it was oddly built- the small$LABEL$2
This Starbucks is 5-Star Friendly. The shift supervisor Lucious keeps the energy in there moving and light. He recently helped me with a merchandise return and embodied everything a good manager and all around mensch person should - patience$LABEL$5
For someone who straddles the line between sometimes craft-er$LABEL$2
I have been frequently shopping at this Michaels store over the last couple months since I began taking a cake decorating class and hosted a large baby shower at my home. The store has typically had the supplies that I need from cake and cupcake baking and icing to scrap booking supplies. This location is pretty average compared to other Michaels - it's exactly what you would expect when going to this store. It's not a large store$LABEL$3
The one good thing I can say about Michael's is that they have a wide variety of hobbies and crafts included in their selection. They've got items for woodwork$LABEL$2
Its clean$LABEL$3
This is the absolute WORST Steak N Shake I've ever been to. The bf and I got lost around Pittsburgh for 40 min. trying to find this location and on top of the unnecessary 1 hour wait for our food$LABEL$1
I went here at 3 PM between the lunch rush and the dinner rush$LABEL$1
Well... as Steak 'n Shake locations go$LABEL$2
In general I do like Shake N' Steak$LABEL$2
Rather typical SnS.  Had a good lunch crowd.  Milkshake was good but not as good as EnP down the street.  It took to long to get the burger for some reason$LABEL$2
Ah$LABEL$3
The only thing worse than the food is the service.$LABEL$1
Terrible wait staff  couldn't even seat us. Before we$LABEL$1
This place is s l o w....like so slow I have got up and left after waiting 30 minutes and not even being acknowledged by a server. The food is okay. Def not worth the wait. Milkshakes are just okay as well. Booooooo.$LABEL$2
I really like the chili. Burgers are fair and salads are pretty bad. Pretty hard to mess up a side salad. As others have said you never know what kind of service you will get. Store is usually understaffed and cleanliness is fair. The staff is usually disinterested with customers and sometimes outright rude. All in all what you pay is what you get. Cheap and crap service.$LABEL$2
Fast food done right$LABEL$3
Fast food in a resturant setting.  Considering this food is good and cheap plus you can get food to go.  Must be a reason why this place is always packed.$LABEL$4
The food is good. Unfortunately the service is very hit or miss. The main issue seems to be with the kitchen$LABEL$2
Food is good$LABEL$1
The service was fast but the food was terrible and so was the service. I had a bus to catch so I couldn't wait around waiting for the check so I went to the counter to pay. She never brought my check$LABEL$1
I should have known better than to stop here$LABEL$1
Burgers are not the best quality. Better than McDonald's but not much better. The fries are fairly thin$LABEL$3
You know what you're getting with a Steak N Shake: it's about one rung up from a McD's in quality$LABEL$1
I love Steak N Shake. This one$LABEL$1
Every time we come here the service is laughably bad. On this visit a tabe which was sat after us had their food before our server graced us with her surly presence. Good restaurant elsewhere$LABEL$1
Wow. Dirty and slow.  The floors felt like they had the days burger grease spilled all over$LABEL$1
This place teeters between a 2 and a 3 star review.  I've had pretty good experiences inside$LABEL$2
This location is terrible. The drive-thru workers are rude and they give you crap food. I waited 5 minutes before being able to order$LABEL$1
Steak 'n Shake's food is pretty good and the prices aren't bad for the quantity of food. I ordered a grilled chicken salad with no dressing. The salad looked thrown together and was $5.49 for 2 croutons$LABEL$3
Nice staff but apparently there is little manager oversight around 3:28am.I do like this place.  It must be nice to work somewhere that allows you to choose your own tasks.  Like smoking$LABEL$2
It's okay. Food is cheap but portions are small. For example I order the chicken tenders$LABEL$2
As far as I'm concerned$LABEL$4
Even when we didn't have a car Filene's Basement was worth the bus trip to the Waterfront. I always find something (usually I find 3-4 things and spend about $60) and better still$LABEL$4
Love this store!  Don't always have much luck with the sales$LABEL$5
Another store which has gone the way of the Dodo bird. Actually there was nothing basement like about it. What will be done with the empty space that is the question?$LABEL$2
$9.75 for a red bull and vodka? I'm sorry$LABEL$2
Really enjoyed this a lot more than I thought I would.  The drinks were on the pricey side$LABEL$3
Had a great time at Sing Sing a while ago with friends.  Friendly staff.  Will return.$LABEL$5
In my opinion$LABEL$2
Dueling piano bars in Pittsburgh started at Station Square$LABEL$3
Sing Sing is awesome!! Give a buck or more and they will play anything$LABEL$5
What a great time!  This place was awesome!  I wish I lived right down the road$LABEL$5
This place has gone significantly down hill.  I've gone to Sing Sing about once a year for the last 6 or 7 years.  When we started going there you couldn't get a seat unless you got there early.  It was always packed.  However$LABEL$2
Went here for the first time this past weekend. Needless to say I'll be returning! It was a blast!!!It was cheap to get in and since we got there a bit earlier we got a semi-good table. Though it was very annoying that people had reserved tables right up front and never showed up. WHAT IS WRONG WITH THESE PEOPLE?! Everything if you ask me! Seriously though if you're going to reserve a table$LABEL$5
Always a good time$LABEL$4
The musicians at this place work hard to entertain the crowd$LABEL$3
I went here with a bachelorette party. We had reservations$LABEL$2
He was incredibly sexist/homophobic. He could barely play the piano and when we finally recognized a song we could actually dance to he literally asked me to get off stage because he didn't like another on stage who could actually dance with the girls.$LABEL$1
Pretty fun place to go every once in a while$LABEL$3
My best friend took me to Sing Sing for my bachelor party. I had a blast. The musicians (dueling pianists) made fun of me in a bunch of songs. They also were really good at playing requested tunes (rock). When the show was over we shuffled across the hall to the connected \""Rock Bottom\"" restaurant for some grub. We all had so much fun that we went back for my buddy's bachelor party.There were some drawbacks though. We went on a Thursday night so the atmosphere was lacking as the place was pretty empty. And of course they are a little pushy soliciting tips when the place is empty. But it's not our fault the place is empty on Thirsty Thursday$LABEL$3
I usually have nothing but good things to say about this place. I've dealt with Fran and others and have had very good experiences. However$LABEL$2
Typical$LABEL$3
When making a Customer's paymento atLowe's$LABEL$1
Would like to give NO STARS.  bought all new kitchen appliances there.  Refrigerator is defective.  Theysend an outside company to repair.  Man arrives with NO TOOLS and wrong size seal for freezer.  not once$LABEL$1
Your typical area big box hardware store.  It's convenient to go to because of the proximity to other stores and how close it is to so many communities.Can't really say much else about this place other than with the self checkout lanes it's a breeze to run in and then out without having to deal with a single associate.$LABEL$3
This local Lowe's serves its purpose for my husband and me -- a convenient home improvement store that we run into every month or two. I am most impressed by the lawn and garden section of the store. I am not sure how it compares to other Lowe's stores$LABEL$3
Waterfront Lowe's beats Monroeville Lowe's for lawn and garden.  Hate to admit it$LABEL$4
The food here can actually be a little hit and miss$LABEL$5
This place is overrated. A friend and I were looking forward to a beer and some good bar food- instead the wings were terrible and the beer was good but overpriced. There's nothing wrong with this place I just don't understand the clout around it. There should be no clout.$LABEL$2
There's lots of potential here because of the wonderful character and ambiance of this place$LABEL$2
Before today I probably would have given this place three stars based mostly on their beer selection; however$LABEL$1
I'm reading on here that the food is really hit or miss. I've only gone to Duke's one time$LABEL$3
I've been to Duke's three times now. When I first came to PGH$LABEL$2
D&B is nice once in a while but the food is insanely unhealthy. They are also really clever about designing the psychological context in ways to extract money from their customers. You feel a bit milked afterwards. Also much fatter.You pay for games using credits from mag-stripe cards. This lets D&B give their games arbitrary prices and makes it harder for you to really know how much you are spending. Menus for drinks and food have no prices. $6.05 for a Banana Split cocktail? $3.40 for a Michelob?  I have no idea whether that is expensive but not showing the prices is clever because they can price their things and not have to obey pricing psychology (like anchors and so forth).Waitstaff hassle you repeatedly to order desserts. Oh$LABEL$2
This was actually the first time I've ever been to a Dave and Buster's.Walking into such a huge space$LABEL$3
I love the games here but can't go very often since they don't rotate new games in very often.  The place is usually pretty clean.Pool tables often have a wait on the weekend but are some of the better ones you'll find in the city.Food is just \""ok\"" Drink prices are fair but not great.$LABEL$4
Dave and Buster's is an enigma$LABEL$2
The food was absolutely gross! I ordered a turkey club which comes on a wheat bun with avocado$LABEL$1
Not much of a review for this one$LABEL$2
Dave and busters is the best place to eat and play games. There is many fun games and prizes to win. I highly suggest if you want to plays games$LABEL$5
When did Dave and Buster's become a daycare?? Everywhere you look$LABEL$2
Dave and Buster's has to be split up into separate experiences to rate it. Dining: 2 starsI had a party of 20 coming in; I had called ahead of time$LABEL$3
Chuckie Cheese for grown ups...Yeah$LABEL$3
Mediocre service. COLD food! Our food waited so long the lettuce & pickles wilted. Bland food. Crazy overpriced. Long waits in the arcade. 1 beer per hour maximum.  Avoid at all costs. Fair manager.$LABEL$1
Not being from the area$LABEL$2
This place just plain sucksBad management lost them bizDumb arcade drama** they have recently changed their under 21 policy so no one underage can even be in the arcade or restaurant after 10pm despite having a guardian over 30 years old$LABEL$1
i had fun here.. fun big kid games for me!!!O.. But the bartender Melissa was a SUPER bitch and RUDE Hope they fire her..$LABEL$3
DAVE & BUSTERS!  It's a nice place to eat$LABEL$3
A fun place and lots to do but a bit pricy. $20.00 will buy you a hundred points which will last you a little over an hour.I recommend the bowling game$LABEL$3
Visited the Dave and Busters in Homestead$LABEL$1
My boyfriend and I are in our 20s$LABEL$2
Most of the games were out of order and I had to find one of those referee looking people to fix 2 of them that took some of our credits.  Apathetic service staff all around$LABEL$1
ehh$LABEL$3
Ok! Let me tell you about my bad experience first. I went to D&B last night for a post wedding party - which$LABEL$2
I used to love D&B when it first opened in the Waterfront$LABEL$2
I was here on 10/3 and I have to say this was a horrible experience.  Me and a friend went here to eat and play a couple games afterwards.  It took the waitress at least 10-15 minutes to greet us and by that time we knew we should just order then because we might not see her again.  We ordered and got our drinks and well let's just say we didn't see the waitress again until she was giving us our check (some manager delivered the food to the table).  No refill on my beverage$LABEL$1
I'll have a biased opinion of any place like this. What could be wrong with playing old and new school games$LABEL$4
First off$LABEL$5
My sister and law wanted to go here for lunch so all the kids could play games after we all had some lunch together. This place is huge and was moderately clean except the bathrooms. All of the food looked great on the 16 page menu. When our food came though$LABEL$2
Rock Bottom Brewery in Homestead is always a good time.  They brew their own semi-micro brew here and generally have as many as eight brews to chose from.  Saturday night C and I stopped by to have a little dinner and enjoy some of their frosty beverages.  Our first issue of the night was getting to Rock Bottom.  As the restaurant is located in Homestead$LABEL$3
Horrible beer$LABEL$1
SUMMARY:If I was in the area and no one had a better suggestion for where to go$LABEL$2
Not the greatest ale house in the city but certainly not the worst.I like the food and I have tried all the beers.  They're just \""OK\"" as far as beer goes.Large portions. Friendly staff.$LABEL$3
My friends got everyhing from steak(they didn't even get a well done steak right) to mahi tacos and the only great menu item was the seasoned vegetables- give it a miss. Sing sing next door is awesome but get dinner somewere else. After we were done the waiter asked if we were ready for the checks and I had ordered meal that came with a desert! Really dissapointing all around.$LABEL$1
Little slow on the service and didn't have the beer I wanted on the menu. But you get those things when they brew their own beers on-site.   But the stadium pretzels are good.  The cream stout is tasty.The burgers are good and big with the little skinny fries.  I'm not a fan of the skinny fry$LABEL$3
Lately$LABEL$2
Went with a group after work for dinner and a brew.  We ordered a few appetizers first.  The wings are good and the soft pretzels with spicy spinach cheese dip was fun.  Had a burger$LABEL$3
Beer selection was good$LABEL$4
I always feel like I am constantly bashing breweries for their food$LABEL$2
I was SO ready to like this place!  Turns out$LABEL$3
I must admit$LABEL$2
For a brewery who is attempting to take advantage of Oktoberfest you wonder how at 7 pm they could be out of mashed potatoes & sauerkraut then a sausage platter with sweet mustard guess they have not been to Germany. Not worth $5.95 unfortunately the sausage platter was $15.95.$LABEL$1
Dined in twice$LABEL$3
I've always been pleasantly surprised with the food I've gotten at Rock Bottom.  I say \""surprised' because with any restaurant that falls into the slippery territory of a \""chain\$LABEL$4
I went to Rock Bottom this past weekend$LABEL$2
The only reason Rock Bottom gets 3 stars is because of the brews. Food was \""eh\$LABEL$3
Rock Bottom was our first stop on a 17 mile pub crawl.  As expected$LABEL$4
I haven't been to Rock Bottom in years.  Maybe even decades...is that even possible?  Well$LABEL$4
Slow serviceBelow average food Ill pass$LABEL$2
Its not bad. I'm not into chain kind of places$LABEL$3
Went to Rock Bottom for lunch the other day and was very pleased. My coworker had printed out a coupon for a free mini appetizer. The waitress told us that they were not making mini appetizers and gave us a full sized chicken quesadilla. If you have ever had the southwestern egg rolls from Chili's - the filling tasted like that and I am a big fan! Mondays are half off burger days and I tried the just hot enough burger - topped with crispy jalapenos$LABEL$4
Rock Bottom is a chain brew pub one that$LABEL$2
Went here last night to meet folks for a friend's birthday party. Docking one star due to a few unfortunate things that happened$LABEL$2
Nothing special. Just like Applebee's$LABEL$3
I go to Rock Bottom pretty often for dinner or their awesome beer$LABEL$4
I rarely give a business a superior rating$LABEL$5
I'm not much of a beer drinker$LABEL$4
Came with my BF we started with the crab artichoke dip. It was very greasy and had virtually no crab. The wedge salad was good and crisp. I had the hazelnut crusted chicken. This has to be one of the worst dishes I've ever had it was like pancake syrup over breaded chicken. To finish the meal we had the homemade chocolate chip cookies served with hot fudge. Well there was no hot fudge it was chocolate syrup the ice cream was so crystallized from melting and re-freezing all around disappointing.$LABEL$1
Tom and I decided to try this place out before catching a late movie on a Saturday night. He is a beer buff$LABEL$3
I really miss the Northstar Amber but the specialty beers are always good.  Food is excellent and the service staff is friendly.$LABEL$4
So after an evening of enjoying a comedy show at the Waterfront$LABEL$2
Another good meal ... this time the Housemade Meatloaf. It's a blend of turkey and sausage instead of the standard ground beef. A refreshing and delicious twist on a comfort food staple. Served over cheddar mashed and mixed veggies. The server could have behaved like she wanted to be there but everyone has a bad day once in awhile. Service was prompt just the same. Overall good experience.$LABEL$4
Poor service and food. I waited 20 minutes at the bar for someone to just acknowledge my presence. They finally brought my food out and left it without asking for me to pay.... So I had to wait an additional 15 minutes to find someone to pay. Yes$LABEL$1
Planned a surprise birthday party here for my wife and they did an amazing job helping to pull it off! Service was extremely helpful$LABEL$5
The staff here is very nice and the set up has TVs all around the family so enjoy mostly all sports$LABEL$4
Good food and large portions. I ordered the Veggie Burger for $8.50 and I loved it! It's one of the most unique veggie burgers I have ever had: a homemade patty of beans$LABEL$4
The food is standard American fare--a bit overpriced in my mind--and the beers range from mediocre to very bad.  The K\u00f6lsch is the only decent beer of the bunch.  The service is good$LABEL$2
The beer is good but the food is nothing to brag about at ALL. I've tried many things on the menu$LABEL$2
Be careful. The servers can't pay attention to save their lives$LABEL$1
This is  a \""Okay\"" place to eat.  The food is nothing special.  I guess what they have going for them is the beer.  Order the  Guacamole for the starter which was okay but for $8.50 and the portion was not worth it.  Rice (Cajun Taco) was not cooked well.  Would I go there again \""maybe\"".  If your into beer and watching the game$LABEL$3
Good club for a good laugh. High food prices (most comedy clubs are)$LABEL$3
They have good acts coming around here$LABEL$3
Came here to see Charlie Murphy. Parking was nightmare. I would expect nothing less on a Saturday night.The 15 minute wait to get inside was torture. They need to implement a system where if you purchased tickets in advance you don't have to wait outside. Once inside you we were seated pretty quickly.Seating is first come first serve.The Server was pretty quick to take our orders. I misread the menu description and didn't realize my BBQ sandwich came with cheese.  I don't eat cheese$LABEL$3
I'm HUGE SNL fan$LABEL$3
I've been here twice now$LABEL$3
There's nothing like a Saturday night filled with some good laughs$LABEL$3
My friends & I all purchased Groupons  for the Pittsburgh Improv on or around March 22nd$LABEL$1
The place does what it does best - Comedy.  The food$LABEL$2
The Pittsburgh Improv is unfortunately another great idea hamstrung by the details of mediocre execution (some specific examples at the end).The setup is nice$LABEL$2
I love the Improv. I think its a great way to start or spend a night! Nothing like a laughter filled night. I think its great that we get so many great comedians coming our way (Owen Benjamin$LABEL$3
My husband and I went to do something fun. The comedy was great!  The food$LABEL$2
We came to the Improv for the first time on Friday night for my wife's work holiday party. We arrived early for dinner and drinks from a predetermined menu. Dinner started with a salad of clearly bagged$LABEL$2
This was my second visit to the club and it was still a blast. My girlfriends bought tickets for John Witherspoon for my bachelorette. We were all looking forward to it and it was hilarious! He was wonderful. The servers were fantastic. They always came back to check in on us and make sure we had plenty to eat and drink. I suggest the Pink Cadillac for a drink as well as the cheese cake and chocolate cake for dessert. The only reason it isn't 5 stars is because they had us wait an hour past the time we were to enter the building. We were to see the 9pm showing so the doors were to open at 8:45pm. They came out and explained that the show had run over and we wouldn't be able to even enter the building until 9:20pm. It was 28 degrees outside. We finally were able to enter the building$LABEL$4
Good! I can't comment on the food or the bathrooms$LABEL$4
I love that we have a great comedy club in Pittsburgh with a great location at the Waterfront.  Perfect for a date night and I recommend going to a later show and grabbing dinner beforehand.  I received an online coupon code for $5 tickets for John Heffron. What a deal-def. check for deals before you pay full price for any shows here.  We went early to pick up the tickets at the ticket office.  People were lined up outside about an hour before the show and it was freezing out.  I had no interest in doing this so we grabbed a beer across the street at Rock Bottom. Once they opened the doors (15 minutes before show time) the line went quickly and even though we were at the end we still got seated at a table in the back.  It is not huge inside so there aren't really any bad seats.  They usually have an MC for the night who starts  warming up the crowd. This guy was funny and so was the opening act before John Heffron.  My only complaint about this place is that they have a two drink minimum and the prices are outrageous.  $9.50 for a mixed well drink and $7 for draft beers.  The soda was $3.50! Yikes!  At least we didn't pay full price for the tickets.$LABEL$3
I went here for the first time the other night and had a great time!  The comedian was hilarious and it was a great intimate setting for a fun night out with friends!  My only complaint was that it was a little pricey for the overall experience because not only do you need to buy a ticket$LABEL$4
So...we got here and seated by 635pm. Orders placed. Drinks served. Now it is 752pm. One of my party has still not received his chicken sandwich. I hadMy shrimp diablo. It was as described. Spicy and good!!! But hour plus for a chicken sandwich is unacceptable. We also sent an order of chicken fingers back...dryer than sand. And my fianc\u00e9s chicken Caesar salad chicken was as dry as the chicken fingers. Barely edible$LABEL$2
This is the best Giant Eagle in the area and is the most like grocery stores in Bay Area. Here's why:1. They sell beer!2. Huuuuuge produce selection3. Natural/organic foods section: cereal$LABEL$5
Probably the most comprehensive supermarket in the county$LABEL$5
Nice Giant Eagle$LABEL$3
Wahhhhh!!!! They're remodeling this one and it's frustrating! I swear I don't mind change. I really don't~  I should have seen this coming.  There were telltale signs of this happening. First$LABEL$3
You're getting an extra star for two solid reasons.  One is because the remodel is over and the store is pretty again (and a bit fancier).  Two$LABEL$4
This is easily one of the best Giant Eagles I've ever been to. Huge. Very nice selection. Easily comparable to Whole Foods. Went to their cheese market$LABEL$5
This place has amazing selection when it comes to some things and zero selection when it comes to others.  We popped in here a couple times over the weekend I spent in PIT and both times they didn't really have what we were looking for.  Visit #1: Liquid smoke.  Visit #2: Hawaiian rolls.  I know these items must exist in PA just not @G-Eagle.  They did however have crazy selection when it came to things like....corned beef brisket or anything that has potato in it.  My californian mind was boggled by the variety of brands and cuts of corned beef that were available.  Too bad that wasn't what I was there for.$LABEL$3
oddly enough$LABEL$4
I'm with Rachel C. on this one. You get an extra star for being a pretty Giant Eagle and a Cafe with a very decent beer selection of 6packs and individual bottles. Even though the Giant Eagle in Robinson is better in my opinion you$LABEL$4
This review is specifically for the DFS cleaners at this Giant Eagle location.  I dropped clothing off for the sake of convenience once (I really should have known better).  Never again.  My items came back completely covered in lint.  I could let this slide$LABEL$1
I don't know why$LABEL$3
One comfy seat in the entire place$LABEL$4
Barnes & Noble$LABEL$2
Such nice staff.  I really lament the decline of the modern bookstore.  I really enjoy browsing and picking up a new book.  The store has a great selection and the staff are always helpful and kind.  I really hope this store stays here for some.  The prices are also fair and often have great discounts.$LABEL$5
I have to agree with Matthew U on this one. I do enjoy Barnes & Nobles but sometimes i get lost just trying to find a darn calendar. I went here after a dinner date with some neighbors and couldn't believe how packed it was. We had to wait 10 minutes just to find enough chairs to seat 4 people. We ended up stealing them from other tables. Not to mention my hubby stood in line for 15 minutes just to get an Ice tea lemonade.So amidst all the books$LABEL$3
Nice venue$LABEL$3
I stopped here yesterday with Rob and Matt after golf to have a few drinks prior to seeing \""The Hangover\"" at Loews across the street.  Incidentally$LABEL$2
An absolute must if you're going to a movie and want a drink ($3 drafts and $5 special martinis) and some half-off apps on a weekday from 5 to 7. However$LABEL$3
The Pros: Great view of the city and river in good weather...  Lovely for loud large groupsVaried menu with some original itemsGreat place to watch a game inside with a huge barFun locationGood place to take out of towners.The Cons: The food when I went yesterday was not great.  We got the wrong sandwich$LABEL$3
I had the EXACT same experience as John R. Went here to get a quick bite to eat before seeing a movie across the street. The place was near empty and there were three waitresses. Got seated and waited on immediately. Ordered drinks$LABEL$2
Service has always been good and the food consistent$LABEL$3
Let me just say that this used to be a place I loved.Remember when you'd go somewhere and have good food$LABEL$2
We were going to see a movie that started at 9:40pm. The 2 of us got to Bar Louie at 8:30.  We sat outside$LABEL$1
Food was ok. Waitress was a huge air head. Waited 25 min for my $7.00 beer. Only got it after I reminded her. It is just another disappointing chain restaurant disguised as a local commodity.$LABEL$3
Although I wouldn't  travel out of my way to have dinner here$LABEL$3
When the ratio to wait staff to diners is 3:1 you'd think you could get service!!!Nothing erks me more then seeing idol wait staff and hungry patrons. I very rarely walk out of a restaurant with out having eaten first. I came here on Saturday ay 6pm. Almost none of the diners had food on their table and many of them didn't have drinks in the 15 minutes I was there I counted 9 waitress again I counted 9 waitresses and not a one of them came over to our table to get even a drink order. Just from the looks of it I could tell staying any longer would be a total train wreck. So after 15 minutes of waitress counting we left with empty bellies.$LABEL$1
I came here last night to get a few appetizers before a movie$LABEL$1
The absolute worst service I have ever had at any bar or restaraunt.  And$LABEL$1
I've eaten just once$LABEL$4
$1 burger night on Tuesday. Add ons more.$LABEL$5
It was the first time that I went to this location.  We sat outside and it was a beautiful night.  I had the BBQ Burger with fries.  For the price of the burger I expected something much better.  It was a very thin burger when it came to the meat.  As a whole it looked large but that was only because of what they piled on top of it.  In addition$LABEL$3
I personally enjoyed my recent visit to Bar Louie with a friend but completely understand the poor reviews on help. The restaurant is pricey for what it is$LABEL$3
This is one of those places where the presentation is nice$LABEL$2
Servers are chatting$LABEL$1
Meh$LABEL$1
I am normally a Bar Louie Fan - my husband and I LOVE the one in Tampa.  This location needs a lot of work.  We went on a Friday evening before a show at the Improv.  We were looking to meet up with friends and have drinks and a quick bite to eat.  We never got to the food part because of the level of service that we received.  We got there at about 6:40/6:45 so Happy Hour was wrapping up$LABEL$2
We stopped here to enjoy a drink before our movie. Our server$LABEL$1
I can't even review this place. We sat ourselves and waited for a waitress to take our order$LABEL$1
The food was okay. The noise level--with 10 people in a huge room--deafening. Awful acoustics!$LABEL$2
Food is Shitty probably would be good if they had a cook that knew how to cook it correctly.  Staff is ok no complaints drinks are good as well$LABEL$2
Eh$LABEL$2
Really the only thing good about this place is the happy hour. No one wants to pay $8 for a glass of wine that is a short pour and bottom quality.$LABEL$2
I don't frequent Bar Louie$LABEL$2
My sons a and I came for Tuesday Dollar Burger Night. You can gat a \""burger\"" (beef$LABEL$3
Great environment at night! Songs going on very lively!! The food of my friends who ordered burger and fried shrimps was not that great. But I ordered chicken flatbread which was really delicious! Absolutely loved it  will definitely go here again just for the flatbreads$LABEL$3
I'm not into waterparks as much as I am into amusement parks.  I go to Sandcastle maybe once a year.  But my Chicago friend Catherine came in to visit for the weekend and after a day at the zoo$LABEL$4
It's fun$LABEL$2
Sandcastle is a mixed bag for the kiddos.  On the one hand$LABEL$3
So the last time I went to a water park was probably when I was in elementary school and didn't really know how to swim (... I still kinda don't. lol). Anyway$LABEL$4
okay$LABEL$3
Sandcastle Water Park in P-Burgh was just \""okay\"" for me. I really think that this place is geared towards children more so than adults or \""family\"" because there isn't much fun here for people older than 16. The water slides here were lacking. There were very few of them and the majority of them are boring. The last time I was there (not too long ago) there weren't any extremely modern slides like a tornado slide$LABEL$2
For some reason$LABEL$5
I'm a mattress buying novice. I also hate buying things that require you to try-before-you-buy. I also seem to give explanatory information about myself before reviews. Anyway. I had a lot of anxiousness about buying a mattress. If it's terrible$LABEL$5
Great customer service.  I was in Pittsburgh for business and needed a car to get back to the airport.  I found these guys on Yelp$LABEL$5
Other people may have had a better experience with this company but that was not the case for us.  We had rented a limo/bus for a bachelor party.  Our driver Scott$LABEL$1
So I moved to Pittsburgh from Los Angeles. I know I know I know!Anyway so theres absolutely no places in Homestead that delivered Chinese so I decided to walk down to the closest Chinese food/restaurant to my house. The family that runs the restaurant is very friendly. I read a review about them on Google that said the  mom looks like she might want to cook you alive. Don't believe it!On this visit I ordered the Steamed Dumplings(recommended by some reviewer on google...THAT LIAR) and the Vegetable Chow Fun. I generally enjoy steamed dumplings but these dumplings(too much dumpling little meat) werent so good. Theyll probably be sitting in my mini fridge tomorrow and I'll force myself to eat them when I have the munchies/starving to death. The Vegetable Chow Fun on the other hand verrrrrrrrrrrrrry yummy. Definately most have next time anyone decides to stop by. But all in all the verdict is you typical Chinese Take Out Place.*puts the menu on the fridge*$LABEL$3
The worse \""Chinese food\$LABEL$1
Meh$LABEL$2
This place.. Is ok if ur grabn something quick .. But they do have a great happy hour tho$LABEL$2
Boo!  What happened to this location?  It used to be happy and fun!  It just feels depressing and nearly everyone there is just doing the bare minimum to get by?  So sad.$LABEL$1
I'm not opposed to chain restaurants but this TGI Fridays in comparison to some of the other ones in the area truly falls short of the \""chain\"" expectation. I order the Jack Daniel's chicken and shrimp with just fries. The fries were undercooked and thrown haphazardly into the sauce holder. The shrimp was over cooked and just deepfried. The chicken was fatty and just tasted like it came from their freezer. Even the water tasted weird.Fortunately$LABEL$2
I had a gift card so I decided to use it for a to go order. The food tasted frozen and microwaved. Nothing special just around average!$LABEL$2
Went with 5 others for a weeknight dinner. The server was very friendly$LABEL$2
I don't care what Cub and Bulls fans think$LABEL$2
Not quite authentic but good enough for Pittsburgh. It's the only place that I've found that even comes close to a classic Chicago style deep dish.I also had the french onion soup that wasn't bad. The croutons were still crunchy and it had just the right amount of cheese.My girlfriend really enjoyed her Caesar salad and said she'd come back just for the salad.Overall$LABEL$3
Awful everything. From the bad service$LABEL$1
I really love deep dish pizza. The thick crust that is crunchy on the outside and soft on the inside. The spicy$LABEL$2
Food was ok had a steak w/ shrimp side Ass mashed potatoes. Everything was ok not a lot of flavor.$LABEL$2
I ate here at around 8:00 on a Saturday night.  Reading the other reviews$LABEL$3
My girlfriends made reservations here for my bachelorette party last Saturday. I highly suggest that you make reservations because we were able to just walk right in and sit down. There were people there waiting 30 minutes+. We had the sangria which was amazing. Our sever Alex recommend it and it was perfect for the 4 of us.  I had their thin crust pepperoni pizza which really hit the spot. My two friend had salads which they said were amazing and my other friend joined me in ordering a pesto chicken pizza. Let's just say there wasn't any food left on the table when we were finished.  I will be back for sure.$LABEL$4
Pizza ok on it's own nothing great . Definitely not worth the restaurant price.  definitely not like pizzeria UNO in Chicago. Are they even related   or are they just using their name and trademark.$LABEL$2
The menu is outstanding but the pizza and beer is too expensive. For 2 personal pizzas (the size of pizza hut) 2 beers and 2 salads$LABEL$2
Well this visit started off good. I was seated right away$LABEL$3
All in favor of a deep dish pizza say I!.......IIIIIII$LABEL$4
I had the deep dish pizza and it was very good!  The individual size was smaller Than I expected for $12 but I wasn't starving so it was very filling.  Our waitress April was very nice and attentive for how busy it was.  We had about a 30 minute wait but it was worth it!  I can't wait to try it again!$LABEL$4
My friend and I have never eaten here before so last night we decided to check it out. For a Thursday it wasn't that crowded and we were seated promptly. There were plenty of flat screens and warm lighting that made the place cozy. We ordered a thin crust pizza: on one side there was chicken$LABEL$4
Well$LABEL$1
Nope!$LABEL$1
Was very disappointed with the food. It was overcooked and not seasoned very well$LABEL$2
Nice place but some of the items on the menu are not available unless you get a 2 for 12 but that's not what the online menu states. And it's a salad come on..$LABEL$2
Love the stores selection but HATE how the girls chase you around to tell you their sales. If I wanted to know I'd ask !!!$LABEL$3
Interesting the reviews here are less than stellar already. I would normally not review a chain retail store$LABEL$1
Wasn't terrible$LABEL$3
Honestly$LABEL$1
Stars are for the food only.    2.5 ratingGot there at 8pm on Saturday night$LABEL$2
Went there for lunch and had a decent meal.  While the Mongolian Beef was beyond excellent$LABEL$3
Sadly I've been here a few times because it's a crowd pleaser when my girlfriend's parents come down to visit. There's nothing really WRONG with it. The portions are big and the food is \""alright\"" and the interior gives you the superficial impression that you're encountering fine dining.The food is sooooo bland though. Everything you get at P.F. Chang's you can get elsewhere in Pittsburgh at a much lower cost and it'll be made with more precision and have better flavor. The honey chicken at P.F. Chang's was so mediocre all I could think about while eating it was heading over to Wai Wai in Bloomfield and getting a tastier order of it for 8 bucks.Last time we were there the server was horrendous as well. I don't think I've ever felt as awkward at a restaurant. He brought my girlfriend's father (Don) his unsweetened tea then told him he didn't bring sugar because he asked for it sweetened and then did not understand the concept of sweetening it yourself. He then got all huffy when Don kept asking for it and actually seemed angry at us. When he came back to take our order Don ordered for himself and his wife and before Janey (my girlfriend) and I could order he had already started to walk away. We actually had to yell out to get him to come back and finish our order. (not in an uncivilized or malicious way$LABEL$2
We visitied PF Changs on Sunday with a large group of 20 people.  Although they had to split the tables - everything was delicious!We enjoyed everything from the spring rolls and chicken lettuce wraps...to the mooshu that they made special vegetarian for one of the guests...to the fried banana dessert!if you are with a group$LABEL$4
I've had PF Changs both in Pgh and KC and honestly$LABEL$3
So I have never been to P.F. Chang's before since I'm Chinese and I'm not a huge fan of eating at Chinese/American restaurants when I can eat delicious authentic Chinese food at home (courtesy of my momma). My boyfriend and I were at Dave & Busters and weren't in the mood for American food$LABEL$4
LOVE the food!!!!!! Try the bomb pop martini. The service has definitely Gone down hill in the past year. And when I've  told the manger he just doesn't give a shit.  It's either hit Or miss with service. But food is ALWAYS GOOD$LABEL$3
The service was lackluster. Coffee was warm but delicious. Limited to one cup$LABEL$2
This was my first time at this PF Chang's and I was not impressed. The service was extremely slow even though it was a Sunday night and the restaurant was not very busy. The portions were small. They were also playing 5 year old pop music really loud. Pop music?! Come on--this is an \""Asian Bistro.\$LABEL$1
I was unimpressed with my food and I am even more sad to see$LABEL$3
I really enjoyed my Mongolian beef and pork pot stickers$LABEL$2
I have mixed feelings about this place. I wish I could give 2.5 stars$LABEL$3
Surprised how empty the restaurant was tonight.   First time at this location.  Great service$LABEL$3
Let me start by saying that I do like their food. Last night I went with my wife and two guests. The apps came out fast and were fantastic. Dinner on the other hand$LABEL$2
ok so i've eaten here more than once but just thought to write a review on it. now$LABEL$2
Our last few visits have left something to desire$LABEL$2
If you look at other reviews you will see that I am a very positive person$LABEL$2
A big thank you to Chad Cynamom$LABEL$4
Walked in tonight$LABEL$1
Good quality pork fried dumpling and mongo beef.  Bar service was fast and Efficent.   Good value.  Not a 5 cause dragon eye tea was cold first time around and beef had minor amount of fat.   Fortune was even Postive!$LABEL$4
I seriously don't know why people love this place so much$LABEL$2
We had another opportunity to eat here today and the experience was much improved. There was no crowd to fight and we weren't seated near the door as we were last time. As I expected$LABEL$4
We went last night Saturday night to P.F.Chang located at the Kierlands in Scottsdale. Terrible Experience!!! after waiting over one hour to be seated$LABEL$1
Let me start off by saying I have mostly simple tastes$LABEL$1
This is the fourth Changs I've eat ate. It was pretty good. The food was kinda like it had been previously frozen. Had a strange texture. Some of the changs chicken pieces was stuck together and the breading on the sweet and sour chicken was mushy and falling off the chicken. Overall still pretty good. Would eat at this one again.$LABEL$4
Our family loves this restaurant.  My children and I suffer from food allergies.   I have Celiac's Disease and their gluten free selection for a Chinese restaurant is great.  My children are a completely different ball game.  They have a rare disease called Eosinophilic Esophagitus where food attacks their body.  They are very limited on their food selctions due to not being able to consume any food with gluten$LABEL$5
This place hit the spot. Stopped here before a movie and ate at the bar. We got just what we wanted: quick service and some good eats. I recommend the fried green beans with aioli  -- soooo good! Who knew I liked green beans?! And this trip I tried some sushi and got the spicy tuna roll. Although it was clearly not pieced together by an expert sushi chef$LABEL$5
Extremely helpful staff that knows exactly what shoes are comfortable yet stylish. The shoes I bought were high quality and durable. I was extremely impressed by the staff.$LABEL$5
I live close by so I go here frequently pretty much for the free WIFI and espresso. But here's a secret - they don't seem to know what an Americano is so often I am charged like 75 cents for a double shot of espresso to which they add hot water upon my request. Needless to say coffee is not expensive here as you can fill up as many times as needed without being hassled. Although there regular coffee is undrinkable to my taste. Pastries are baked fresh and are plentiful. There is other foods to choose from ie whole grain bagels are edible and about a buck with no extra charge for butta. Outside seating and people watching is always a good distraction plus there are all kinds of people who frequent this Panera from the very very old and decrepit to the fashionistas taking a break from Victoria Secrets$LABEL$4
I've had bad experiences here a few times now.  I wrote panera bread and haven't heard back.  Bad service all around!!!  Basically$LABEL$2
I like Panera bread but this one is a so so. I always get my fuji chicken salad in every Panera bread I go. All of the other use spring mix to make their fuji chicken salad except this one.. They just use regular salad and salad doesn't taste or look very fresh either. I was kind of excited to find there is a panera bread around us but I am disappointed after trying it. Don't know if we will be back again.$LABEL$3
Panera bread has to be the most inconsistent restaurant I have ever been to. I have posted two pictures of the strawberry poppyseed chicken salad. The first one looks delicious the second one looks like they could've used a smaller bowl. It did not even look appetizing.$LABEL$2
The food was fine. It's a chain. I'm not rating it. The service was absolutely horrible. It started well enough when we ordered lunch$LABEL$1
It was my first time here.  Was recommended by my coworker.  However$LABEL$4
The problem I have this experience compared to my last is that the examination lasted 3 minutes.  The vet checked the ears$LABEL$2
I only allow my dogs to go to Dr. Bezak. I've had a couple Chow Chow's who a lot of vets are afraid of. Doc had a Chow himself so knew what to look out for in the breed. He has taken good care of them over the years.$LABEL$5
I mean$LABEL$3
What can I say$LABEL$4
Oh Target!  You are big corporate America!  But how can I not love you so?  Your prices are the best whenever I need household goods like detergents$LABEL$4
Target is one of my favorite stores -- I just love wandering around late at night when the store is quiet -- it's just so therapeutic! This location is now my closest store$LABEL$4
It's not the greatest Target of all time but it still meets all of your basic needs.If you're looking for produce$LABEL$3
I've been to many Targets and they're all the same. However$LABEL$4
Watch out when it looks like something is on sale.  They mark a rack or table with a big buy one get one or 50% off sign$LABEL$2
Let's start this review by saying that when we are at that point$LABEL$1
I went in to get my suit that I bought last year tailored because I had lost some weight and I couldn't have had a better experience. When I walked in I was immediately created by Bill who was warm and friendly. Anna came out to perform the measurements and mark up the suit. She checked everything$LABEL$5
It's not that delish.$LABEL$2
Great on line service!!!  2nd time placing an order on line and they made it easy as far as getting the correct sizes in a timely manner.$LABEL$5
This store has such bad service. The service staff are rude rude rude.  Save your money$LABEL$1
I love bed bath & beyond! The employees at this particular one are always available and helpful!  The selection$LABEL$4
We just completed our wedding registry at the Homestead location. The customer service was outstanding! One of the employees$LABEL$5
Much like every other Eat 'n Park (3 or 4 stars worth of chain-diner food)$LABEL$2
If you must eat at Eat N Park$LABEL$3
Great location!  I love that you can substitute burger with a veggi patti and that they have gluten free bread.  Love love love the smiley cookies :)$LABEL$5
The food is usually pretty good$LABEL$2
They make a nice breakfast for less than the tip form dinner the night before.  That's not bad!$LABEL$3
Eat n Park is usually decent.  This location though has HORRIBLY SLOW service.  Seriously$LABEL$2
Very good cheap food. Pittsburgh classic.Great desserts! The oreo pie is amazing! The servers are always very friendly. The salad bar could be a little more clean.$LABEL$4
God i hate eat n park. Only reason i have gone is for the salad bar because u cant find a decent salad bar in this city. Just about every entree iv had here is nothing more than rubbish$LABEL$2
If you're looking for a wallet$LABEL$3
Went in here to grab a last minute item I needed for an outfit.  I wasn't going to hold my breath here either$LABEL$3
Since both Marshalls and TJ Maxx are owned by the same company$LABEL$2
A very nice meal in a very nice restaurantPROS:Very good foodinteresting choices--not your typical red lobster crapGreat serviceVery clean (restrooms$LABEL$5
Got lunch from here today. What I sampled: Maine Lobster Bisque (delicious and the whole reason for getting lunch from here)Cheeseburger (decent version I only ate about half$LABEL$3
Service was slow$LABEL$4
I am bummed about this- I had high hopes. Here's a rundown of the evening:Pros:- super friendly waitress$LABEL$2
Service an atmosphere was great. I had the shrimp boil and it was very under-seasoned. Much closer to bland than anything.$LABEL$2
I'm not a mean reviewer$LABEL$1
Will I come here again?  Yes absolutely for drinks$LABEL$1
The service was mostly friendly but I was disappointed in my meal. My meal was way over cooked. The soda was flat and the carbonation needed changed and I felt like we inconvenienced our server by asking for new ones.  Overall$LABEL$2
The food was really good$LABEL$3
I have passed by this place a zillion times and never given it a second look.  I thought it might be a Red Lobster knock off.  Then I asked a friend if they had ever heard of it and they had$LABEL$3
Food was only ok. Had lobster bisque soup not to good. Had the shang Hai Seafood Sampler. The scallops were hard$LABEL$2
We had a bigger party and I think that might have flustered the waitresses just a bit. They forgot about our waters until the food came out$LABEL$3
Beautiful decor. Very genuine staff. Very clean washrooms. Delicious food. I tried the market trio. The blackened tilapia was nice with a little bit of spice. This is a great place for a seafood lover.$LABEL$5
My husband and I went to Mitchell's last summer for our wedding anniversary. We both took a half day at work and we arrived in the early afternoon (after lunch but before the dinner crowd). I can't say enough about this place...we have gone here on a few occasions and I've always been please with everything. Pros: Nice friendly waitress$LABEL$5
I have eaten some very good dinners here.  Although it's a chain$LABEL$3
Went for dinner Friday evening with friends and sat at the outdoor patio. It is so nice and relaxing there with the river and bike trail. The sourdough bread they serve is always hot and fresh. The Chilean sea bass just melts in your mouth$LABEL$5
Top points. Service. I was there with a large group for a meeting. They gave us a private room and two servers took care of us. They were efficient and very accommodating. Kudos. Appetizers: had the crab dip and calamari. Both were good. Servers brought extra chips with the dip as they were needed. I'm always surprised that more chips are not just added to the original dish at this point. Dip was good. Calamari was done well. Preferred the shrimp cocktail Sauce with it versus the Asian type soy sauce that is served with it. Wedge salad with bleu cheese. Waaaaaay too much cheese and I like bleu cheese. I had the blackened tuna with mashed potatoes and seasonal veggies. Carrots were carrot sticks hardly cooked and dry! Green beans overdone and broccoli had seen better days. Simple green beans would have been more appetizing. Tuna had blackening spices but needed a better sear on it. Was not over cooked. Potatoes as expected. Other dishes seen--fisherman's platter. Looked a little greasy$LABEL$3
My husbands first time.  Nice to be able to pick your fish and style of cooking.  I had a trio of Jamaican jerk tilapia$LABEL$4
In the Homestead area of Pittsburgh. Seafood gumbo was very good.Broiled scallops were very good$LABEL$4
Very bad purchase experience. I bought a shirt with a hole covered in the rolled up sleeves$LABEL$1
After further consideration$LABEL$2
I'm not too impressed with this particular Dick's Sporting Goods. It is in a great location in the Waterfront$LABEL$3
I don't see to many options in Pittsburgh for sporting goods. Dick's seems to be the big chain for sporting paraphernalia in this neck of the woods. Their selection is poor especially in the snowboarding and biking section. Maybe it's good for small children who want their first snowboard? It is a very average store with average products. I would like to see some attempt to carry more high end products. I am not into fishing or hunting live prey so I am not sure about these departments? I guess if you want some Under Armor products then this is the place to go because I see aisles upon endless aisles of these types of products.$LABEL$2
I enter every sporting goods stores as a soccer player$LABEL$2
living alone I love the 5 for $20 deals they have on meat. I also love Faygo products when I have a party or bbq so their sales are always right on time. They don't have as many stores in the area but they are worth checking out. The lines are a lot shorter and the staff is a lot friendlier.$LABEL$3
This store has changed hands many times over the past few years and it shows. Fifteen years ago if you didn't get there by 9am you would have fight a crowd. Now it never seems all that busy. Many of the store's best and dedicated employees left or were let go (about five years ago) and product lines change with each new owner. The most recent owner seems to be improving the store and employee turnover has seemed to slow.$LABEL$3
A group of us traveld here to go kenneywood park across the road but we decided not to after what we drove throuhg to get there so we atleast decided to get somthing to eat and man where we happey to get out alive. We where the only normal people in this place. The kids next to us who where only 14 where bragging and saying that they went to jail 2 times in their life. You had people selling their food outsdie the resturant. after seeing that we quickly left and hid in our cars with the doors locked. While we where in there my friend got hit on by 2 girls and they gave him there numbers while the other young guy across the table yeld dont do it dont do it. Must I say more? bottom line is dont go if you are normal and get the hell out of that area cause if you call a shank a happey meal toy then that is the resturant for you.$LABEL$1
By far the worst McDonald's in the world.  Employees are to busy playing grab ass behind the counter$LABEL$1
By far the absolute worst Mcdonalds in theWorld. You can pretty much rest assured that$LABEL$1
Underated and ignored!  if you see this ol time pizzaria near Kennywood stop on by good crust nice and buttery in the sicilian style!  Better then DiSallas  the only thing I can say that is better then Latinas is Mineo's !  they say the best pizzarias are the little holes in the wall type places and this is one of those enviroments!  Small and cozy very nice and relaxing afternoon!  To just enjoy with yourself and a friend!$LABEL$4
This is the best experience I've had at a bike store in the Pittsburgh area.  I have been shopping around for a couple months for a new road bike (which was going to be my first road bike ever$LABEL$5
I've had mixed results here. I would definitely recommend if buying a new bike$LABEL$3
When I think BBB... I think the days of simply bringing your bike in for a quick and relatively inexpensive tune-up and a few fixes are long gone.    This review is more for the repair end of BBB. In their defense BBB does appear to carry some amazing brands of bike (ie Colnago) that you just don't find anywhere else in Pittsburgh. At BBB I was charged $250 for a tune up and a few other things. Granted this included installing a sew up tire (which I can understand would cost approx $50)$LABEL$2
Bought a bike there on my second time in the shop.   Glen is very knowledgeable but can be a bit overwhelming$LABEL$2
Big Bang Bicycles is phenomenal! Amazing selection and service! I live in the San Francisco$LABEL$5
Okay so I just moved to the outskirts of Duquesne$LABEL$2
Good pizza and i love the breadsticks...i don't know too much else about this place$LABEL$3
Pizza is very hit or miss. When the owners are there$LABEL$2
I have been looking for 3 years for good crab rangoon - I finally found it!!!  We had boneless ribs that were absolutely wonderful.  Definitely going back!!!$LABEL$5
Ok this is my first yelp review$LABEL$5
Came here from PGH for the first time.  This bakery is legit.  I bought some Rye bread and Italian 5 grain.  Delicious.  A strange snickerdoodle thing with pink frosting.  Delicious. Chocolate chip cookie dipped in chocolate$LABEL$5
Love butter? Then get thee to Pierogies Plus.I live in St. Louis$LABEL$5
Well for my first time here I was way less than impressed. The lady at the front counter was a crab and  the Pierogies really weren't that great. Rather than be kind and answering my questions I settled with the potato and cheese pierogies. I guess Bloomfield Bridge tavern or Mrs. T's is still my go to place. And plus this place is way out of my way to be treated poorly. I wouldn't go back$LABEL$1
OMG good pierogis in a classic blue collar 'hood. At first glance$LABEL$4
Best pierogies in tahn!  I usually just go with the standard potato and cheese but I've also tried a few of the other pierogies and some of the plus.  These pierogies can't be beat.  Made by hand with love in the traditional old world style$LABEL$5
Just finished a dinner of pierogies that our Pgh family brought to WV - always look forward to Pierogies Plus - try the apricot for a sweet treet!$LABEL$5
The experience was not that great. The lady taking the orders was nice$LABEL$2
Have been here two times after stopping at Mancini's Bakery. Have only had the Hamburger/Cheese/Bacon w/ fries but huge portions and great price. Great Quality also. Server is really nice also. Will be eating here again. Heard the Breakfast items are also great. Saw the waffles and pancakes....were huge!$LABEL$4
On a random Sunday morning I went in search of a good breakfast spot.  I decided to explore the McKees Rocks neighborhood and came upon Marge's Place.  I hadn't heard much about this place$LABEL$5
Very quaint! Stopped here for lunch while traveling for work$LABEL$4
Great service$LABEL$5
They do great quality work. The only reason I did not give them five stars is for their lack of customer courtesy not once but twice. I am a very patient and understanding person$LABEL$2
ewwww$LABEL$1
It wasn't a busy night at the neighborhood$LABEL$2
Called for an arrangement for pickup$LABEL$2
The order process went well and the delivery arrived in a timely manner. I saw a picture of the flowers my friend received and the arrangement  wasn't even close to what was pictured on the website...a lot more filler flowers despite ordering the premium arrangement. I picked this place specifically because of what they offered despite other cheaper places in the area. I am disappointed because I wanted the best arrangement possible for my friend who is going through a tough time. I will not order from this place again.$LABEL$2
Meh. I've ordered from here twice and not really been enthusiastic about the results either time. Keep in mind that I haven't had pizza from this place yet!Their steak hoagie is middling-good; nothing to write home about$LABEL$2
A great little place. Delicious and affordable Italian food. Great salads and pasta. Try the pizza rolls!$LABEL$4
I stopped by here this past Tuesday in order to pick up a to go pizza.  My fiance$LABEL$2
Luigi's pizza is amazing! The sicilian pizza takes me back to how my grandma used to make homemade pizza. I can't wait to go back - definitely worth the 45-minute trip there :)$LABEL$5
Recently I've found myself patronizing Bellevue a little more$LABEL$3
I stop by here frequently when I am on my way to work for breakfast. The drive thru is fast but they do tend to get the order wrong. But I will say that I have had more free meals here due to them comping me for all messed up orders. The staff is friendly.$LABEL$3
I have never gotten an order correct from this specific McDonald's. I'm not sure what the problem is$LABEL$1
My orders have come out bad pretty much every time I have ordered from here. The chicken nuggets come out under par. I'm lucky if the fries come out right. My last experience is the last straw. I recently posted a photo of my Chicken Ranch Club. That has no chicken. This is ridiculous. I am done going to this Mcd's.$LABEL$1
Delivery is slow and not even close to the best Chinese in the area.  No matter if it's rice or noodles or chicken or pork$LABEL$1
Wow. What a shame. My family just moved to the area and have been sampling the local cuisine. We are a very large family and love foods of all kind. We've eaten Chinese food from a hundred different places in a dozen different cities. Hands down$LABEL$1
The pros:You get a TON of food for your money. If the food was actually decent$LABEL$1
We ordered from here because Uncle Chen$LABEL$3
If you have any common sense at all$LABEL$1
Horrifying.  This place should be ashamed of itself.  DO NOT STAY HERE.  Beyond dirty$LABEL$1
came back to Pittsburgh for a wedding and couldn't find anything in my price range close to the city until i found this motel...it was very affordable....room was okay...cable tv and a/c worked fine....$LABEL$4
OMG who wrote the review below? A big fat liar/someone that was paid to write that! I stayed there for an hour this past weekend (my friend and I were both intoxicated and figured laying down a few hours would get us better suited to finish driving home). This place looks like it hasb't been cleaned (or furnished) since the 80s. Literally there was grime on the walls$LABEL$1
I was in need of a pedicure before my beach vacation$LABEL$3
My Mom was up from Mississippi for Thanksgiving$LABEL$2
I got a pedicure here. Not bad$LABEL$1
This is my favorite 'event' restaurant (by which I mean$LABEL$5
Yes!!!!!!Great service!Great Food!Love the BYOB!!! ($5).$LABEL$5
STAY AWAY$LABEL$1
I think it is ridiculous that they say they need more clients!  I was all ready to be a new client.  I had a 12:30 appointment with them$LABEL$1
Now I'm picky about my hair$LABEL$1
Let me just tell you$LABEL$5
Quite possibly the best bakery in Pittsburgh.  It's got everything from the low-end (cookies$LABEL$5
Lincoln Bakery is yet another local bakery I've been meaning to try.  When a Google Offer came up$LABEL$3
Cookies aren't bad.  Haven't had a reason to buy cakes or other pastries.  Staff is friendly and it smells like heaven.$LABEL$3
Lincoln Bakery makes very delicious donuts$LABEL$4
Got a key lime pie from this place. It was horrid. Icing was stale cake thick$LABEL$1
Everytime I eat at this location I end up with a sick stomach.  I don't have that problem at other Arby's.  The dining area is clean and everything else seems ok but I always get a sick stomach.  Maybe they should relook at their food prep.$LABEL$2
So I came to this Red White and Blue with high hopes of thrift store mecca$LABEL$2
Woo Hoo!  Dead Lady.This thrift store rocks.  I have been doing this for more years that I haven't been$LABEL$5
I came here all the time while I was freelancing and in charge of my own schedule.  It has a lot of points going for it that other thrift shops consistently mess up.1. It's well lit.  You can SEE the clothing$LABEL$5
Simply the best thrift store I've ever been to. Well worth the 3 1/2 hour drive from my hometown.First$LABEL$5
I cannot imagine a more miserable place to shop than this jam-packed monstrosity.  This is a store that makes me thankful for Goodwill and The Salvation Army resale stores.  The customers and the staff are miserable at Red White and Blue.  The clothes are priced far higher than other such shops.  Merchandise is not refundable or exchangeable$LABEL$1
Ever shopped at a Thrift Shop that sells high end labels$LABEL$5
Love the store. Great stuff$LABEL$1
I love a deal$LABEL$5
Prices not great for true thrifters. Staff completely useless. No dressing rooms. I simply have nothing to say about this place.$LABEL$2
I love love LOVE this store. I thought the one on Saw Mill Run was great but this was i think is way awesomer. If only awesomer were a word. I love to go here and find lots of home decor items to decorate my house. candle holders$LABEL$5
I can't believe I've been here multiple times and haven't reviewed it yet.  I absolutely love this place.  It's a super thrift store if you will.No matter when I come here$LABEL$4
This thrift store is one of the best in Pittsburgh; it's huge and has a great selection of books$LABEL$4
nice and clean with well organized large selection but was expensive. I was looking for some twin size thin cotton blankets easy to wash and hang dry for my dog and the prices were $14.99 of course somewere high quality items which u would have to pay new retail store price $40-50 but still overpriced. I finally found a small blanket for $7 on sale.$LABEL$3
The home-cooked breakfasts at The Rusty Nail in Bellevue are wonderful$LABEL$2
I've been going here since I was a wee tot.  I have always enjoyed their food even though there's nothing too special about it.  I really like their breakfast menu.  You always seem to get lots of food for very little money$LABEL$4
I really wanted to like the Rusty Nail.  I love little local restaurants like this.  But it really is a very tight squeeze$LABEL$2
Given that the Rusty Nail has been highly recommended to me as a good breakfast spot by various sources$LABEL$2
I always see this place$LABEL$2
I ate here this past Sunday morning for breakfast with my girlfriend.  I have been by this place many times and was excited to finally make it inside.  We were lucky that we went fairly early as a line developed shortly after we were seated at our table.  The Rusty Nail is prepared for this in a pretty cool way though as they have a list outside of the restaurant that you can sign into as well as some coffee to partake of while you wait.For my entree I decided to go with one of the specials for the day which was the Rusty Nail omelet while my girlfriend decided on another special which was the a mushroom$LABEL$4
A great Pittsburgh diner with friendly service and good diner food. If there are any problems$LABEL$3
I am very happy to be moving into a 'neighborhood' that has a line-up of decent mom-and-pop shops to find a reasonable meal when the cupboard is bare$LABEL$3
Place has amazing omelettes that are almost as big as the size of the plate. You get a really big side of home fries too. This is probably my favorite place for breakfast in Pittsburgh. I generally go in and get a seat right away without waiting. Service is usually fast and friendly. Two downsides to the place. 1) they are cash only which can be an inconvenience. I never remember to have cash until I get my bill so I have to run to the ATM. 2) the seating is limited and the tables are very close to each other so people there can most likely hear your conversations. Place overall is excellent and is worth a try at least for breakfast. The lunches and dinner selections aren't bad either!!$LABEL$5
This place is overpriced and the service is not good at all.  When we where there children were riding bikes in the lot near the tables.  One almost hit our child.  Another customer said that if the owner had been there she would have not allowed the bikes to be there.  The cone was large to say the least but the taste left something to be desired.  Not the best neighborhood either with a bar nearby.  Our children were exposed to language that would have made a sailor blush.  We will not be back.  Also they will accept a credit card but not a debit card?????  Please get up with the times.$LABEL$1
First time here and I wasnt impressed at all!  I should have gone to the dairy queen :-($LABEL$2
Thank You Kim and Kurt! It was very nice of you guys to take the time to post your reviews on our service. We really appreciate it. We hope your clocks will continue to do well for years to come. Please dont hesitate to give us a call if there's anything else we can do for you.LisaPaul's Clock Repair$LABEL$5
I can not express my thanks & gratitude enough to everyone at Paul's Clock Repair.  I needed an Atmos clock repaired$LABEL$5
Good selection$LABEL$4
I stopped by here on my way home from whole foods market. They had just paved there parking lot which can only fit 3 max cars at a time. It was not as big as the one I normally shop at in Penn Hills. They are a beer distributor and have a way hugger selection. But they serve all of penn hills so go figure.I was looking for a gluten free beer which they had four kinds including cider. The prices were crazy expensive. $35 for a 24 pack of cider. NO way!! I had to buy it though cause it was sunday at 4:30 and all the stores close at 5 so i had no choice. I should have waited but i drove all the way here to get it so I should just buy it while i'm there. Aside from the money issue this place was just ok to me.$LABEL$3
We are fans of Pistella Beer Distributors simply because we needed beer one night while visiting some friends and family in Pittsburgh and they happened to be on the way to something we were doing.  It's a hole in the wall kind of facade but they do have a good selection.  I don't remember the price being that expensive but looking at the average review so far...it shows $$$$.  I'm sure they have some nice stuff$LABEL$4
Animal Elegance is not much on the outside but the owner was very nice & LISTENED to how I wanted my teacup poodle groomed and used the products that I requested.I was very happy with my services and I will return.  My poodles groom was $50$LABEL$4
I had a very unfortunate experience with this groomer. My dog  was not groomed to my specifications; infact she was butchered. I went to the trouble of taking a photo of my dog with  the haircut that I wanted$LABEL$1
They made my Portuguese Water Dog look horrible. They actually sheared all the fur from my dog claiming that it was matted and therefore they had no choice. This isn't true as I personally brush my dog every morning. When I complained$LABEL$1
I made it back here about two weeks ago.  I must say the experience was night and day compared to the one at the end of July.  Whether or not it was an off night I do not know$LABEL$2
I've been told several times that this place had a great brunch.  Upon arrival$LABEL$1
I often have lunch at the nearby Point Brugge Cafe$LABEL$2
Pino's appears to fashion itself something of a nouveau-Italian$LABEL$2
\""God this is the best eggplant that I have ever tasted!\""  was what our friend said after he took his first bite of the Sicilian eggplant served at Pino's.  My husband couldn't wait to have the seafood fra diavlo$LABEL$5
I went to Pino's to celebrate a friends birthday on a Thursday night.  I hadn't been in Pino's since they renovated$LABEL$4
I have had lunch at Pinos's several times probably at least 5 times. Usually I am there  for a business lunch when I am in the area. I find that we are well served$LABEL$3
The food here is ok but not worth the price. $15 corking fee? $9 a glass of garbage wine? Me thinks not.What really tops it off is the owner is beyond rude and doesn't care about the business. I heard it used to be much better but now I don't know anyone who eats there...$LABEL$1
Another really good meal here!  My friend and I went for soup and appetizers--and licked the plates clean!  Gazpacho$LABEL$5
I ate here this past Friday with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  We decided to come here because it was Pittsburgh restaurant week and they offered a special 3 course $30 fixed price menu with 2 course wine pairing for $12.  It ended up being a small little restaurant in the middle of Point Breeze which I had been past many times previously but never really noticed.The restaurant was swamped whenever we got there$LABEL$4
I grew up just the street from Pino's and my family were probably its most regular customers -- we got take-out at least once or twice a week for many many years$LABEL$2
Went here with a gift card from the restaurant week photo competition. We were one of two tables there and a bunch of staff showing up during the meal. Our waitress was good$LABEL$2
My husband and I celebrated our one year wedding anniversary this past weekend and since we recently have moved into a new area of town$LABEL$2
Nice atmosphere with above average food. This restaurant has a lot of potential. The wait staff was far below average: They were slow$LABEL$2
We were huge fans of Pinos a few years back before the wine bar concept was adopted. In all honesty$LABEL$2
There was absolutely nothing not to like.  Reasonably priced wines$LABEL$5
Small portions. Over priced food. Very small menu (dinner). Was OK$LABEL$3
I went to Pino's with my three other friends for Restaurant Week and was underwhelmed and completely disappointed. We chose an option for each course of  the very limited Restaurant Week menu. I selected the baked eggplant caprese appetizer$LABEL$1
I went to Pino's recently$LABEL$1
Very disappointing meal.  After waiting for a half hour$LABEL$1
This was the place I brought friends visiting from out of town when I wanted to show them the classy Italian  spots in Pittsburgh. After my visit last night$LABEL$1
If you don't like your food... do not send it back to the kitchen... The \""Chef\"" will come out and scream at you... Stay away from this place.$LABEL$1
Pinos offers an unhappy marriage of good food at bad prices.  The food is tasty but not transcendent.  The prices in the high $20's for most of the entrees are not justified by the quality$LABEL$3
Great$LABEL$1
Definitely overpriced for what they offered.  Took my car in to check my AC$LABEL$1
This Giant Eagle truly is giant!  And believe me$LABEL$2
I have to agree that this is one of the poor examples that Giant Eagle has.  Granted$LABEL$2
I cannot in my life understand why this Giant Eagle$LABEL$2
This Giant Eagle seems more like a GetGo than an actual supermarket. As soon as you get in you want to get out as quickly as possible. You don't want to do any major grocery shopping here. For one$LABEL$2
I prefer this store to the Market District on Centre. It's just as overpriced and poorly laid out and maybe a bit grimy$LABEL$2
Been yelled at by other customers (today for instance)...place is super ghetto...avoid at all cost. Today$LABEL$1
I been going to this place since the 90s and this place is the MIDDLE CLASS GE. I stopped going to this place since I got a job at whole foods. My mom went here a two weeks ago for the first tine in a long time she say that the people are still there and the place looks better and the people are a lot friendly now. So if you don't what too shop at a Middle Class food store in East Liberty then go to The Market in Shadyside.$LABEL$5
I agree with other reviews$LABEL$2
Ugh. Dirty. Long lines. Walked out without making purchase .$LABEL$2
Figure I'd give Supercuts a shot since Giant Eagle sells their gift cards so it is great for fuelperks.  I don't remember her name but she is one of the \""bigger\"" woman there.  I wanted to grow out my hair longer but it was looking messy.  So I asked her for a trim to get the sides/back cleaned up.  She said ok and off she goes.  5 minutes later$LABEL$1
Nothing spectacular$LABEL$3
I wish I could return a haircut.Unfortunately Kelly$LABEL$1
i'm not sure why this place has bad reviews. its par for thecourse for supercuts. standard cut 16.95 is a bit pricy but they always do exactly what I say. i've simple hair so it works well for me. employees are generally nice$LABEL$3
Went here with a friend for his haircut. It's been a long time since I've been to a barber shop or haircut salon/store$LABEL$3
I went there today! The cut was terrible! I have an awful experience. They lady that cut my hair was nice but she wanted to leave early so she made a disaster in my head!$LABEL$1
According to Urbanspoon (blasphemy I know) their are like 1$LABEL$5
Decent neighborhood pizza can be found in morningside at eddies pizza haus. The sauce and cheese are perfect$LABEL$3
Food: There are countless options to choose from for vegetarians or carnivores$LABEL$2
This place features everything you can expect from a standard hole-in-a-wall Chinese restaurant. There's zero ambiance$LABEL$2
Note: Tasty has a credit card minimum of $10 and has a parking lotTasty is another standard chinese takeout place - it didn't blow my mind but overall it was good$LABEL$3
My wife and I have been going here for as long as we have lived in Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
Tasteless food that arrived over an hour after it was ordered and was cold.  Will never order from here again.$LABEL$1
Not Tasty At All.$LABEL$2
Never received my order and was left in a bad mood. The driver did not carry GPS for delivery$LABEL$1
Home of the Italian Army.Vento's is located in the East Liberty section of Pittsburgh right next to Home Depot. They have been in business forever! They are a pizza and hoagie shop. They are famous for their Italian Army hoagie. I have friends that as soon as they land in Pittsburgh they come straight to Vento's for the pizza! It is Sicilian style pizza and It is delicious! Everything is made fresh so sometimes you have to wait a little while for your food. It's best to call ahead if you're really hungry.They have tables and booths for seating. You can even play the PA lottery there. No debit or credit cards. CASH ONLY!(F.Y.I. There is a generic ATM that charges $1.75 to make a withdraw.)$LABEL$5
Good pizza and hoagies.  It is always busy.  Cash only.$LABEL$4
I had heard lots of good things about Vento's. Unfortunately I did not get to experience these things. The service was slow and lukewarm. The pizza was expensive and not the same price in the restaurant as advertised on the website http://www.ventospizza.com/. Also$LABEL$2
We were visiting from out of town and just spent 6 hours driving. Found this place$LABEL$1
Horrible Food don't waste your moneyThis is the worse cardboard covered cheese & sauce so called pizza I've ever had$LABEL$1
This place has the worst service I've ever seen. I called in two cold sandwiches and was told it would be 15 mins. When I got to the counter$LABEL$1
This is a Pittsburgh/Shadyside institution.What can I say$LABEL$4
This was one of the worst dinners out I've had in recent memory. On the other hand$LABEL$2
I went to this place because I had a LivingSocial voucher. Even with this voucher I feel like I paid too much money. I think I could have had better food if I went over to the Giant Eagle across the street and heated up a Lean Cuisine. I do have to wonder why the owners would put out the living social deal when what really would help business at the restaurant would be simply to improve the quality of the food.The only positives I can give are that it isn't pretentious and the waiter provided very good service. It was almost empty for a Monday at 7 PM$LABEL$2
Based on some recent reviews$LABEL$3
Minutello's is going out of business. Last day of operation is Sunday$LABEL$3
The people that work here make an unfortunate incident a breeze to work through.  I woke up one morning to find a note attached to my windshield to inform me that I was the victim of a hit and run.  The damage was minimal$LABEL$5
Mikes took my car after horrible repairs/service from Kenny Ross South.  The service was great and I even got to meet the owner who came out to personally speak with me on a busy Friday afternoon.  Great guys there.$LABEL$5
I took my car to Mike's auto body as it's recommended by Geico and is part of their easy claims and repair process.  This was a big mistake.  Like many of the reviewers here$LABEL$2
I had a great experience taking my vehicle to Mike's for repair after a fender bender. I used the Geico express service - I booked the estimate and repair online for the next day. When I dropped off my car$LABEL$5
I'm a crazy cat lady and proud of it! Being a volunteer here has been so fulfilling on many different levels.  It has made me feel so good to be able to help out with something that I feel passionately about.  You can tell that the staff puts a lot of effort into taking care of these animals they accept in.  A lot of times people will say$LABEL$5
I have an almost three-year-old cat named Jack that I spoil as if he were my son. I honestly never experienced the love for and from an animal until I adopted Jack from an Animal Rescue League. It was one of the best decisions I've ever made.The shelter is great and I'll probably get another cat in the near future. Check this location out!$LABEL$5
Please do not adopt any pets from here until they update their standards.  I hate to think of animals living in cages$LABEL$1
I adopted a dog from the ARL this past spring.  During the adoption process the employees were polite and seemed genuinely happy for me.  Shortly after the adoption$LABEL$5
Our cat recently came down with some health issues that we could not afford to address. He was in pain and we decided the humane thing was to put him to sleep. We went to the ARL and asked the receptionist there if we had any other options available to us. \""Well basically the only thing you can do is sign him over for euthanasia\"" she said in the most uncaring$LABEL$2
Staff members here have always come up short. A past kennel worker  sold his litter of pit bull puppies in east liberty and the shelter was made aware of it  but excused it. They will lie to surrendering families because they don't  want the cold hard truth$LABEL$1
This is a terrible shelter.  It appears that they routinely turn away (or kill$LABEL$1
This place is PHENOMENAL.I got my bunny here a few months ago and the ladies were so nice and helpful and they take SUCH good care of the animals.  They gave me a bit of hay and food for her that lasted me close to three months.  Then when we were leaving we saw a cage of six dwarf hamsters and they gave us a deal of 2/$10.I love my animals so much and I will always check here first for pets before anywhere else.$LABEL$5
This is a bizarre CVS$LABEL$2
I go to this CVS all the time$LABEL$2
Never again. Let me repeat$LABEL$1
The times I've been here$LABEL$2
This place is a disaster. I made an appointment online for 5:30PM. When I got there they refused me service$LABEL$1
Tire replacement$LABEL$1
I was just there this morning for a 10am appointment to get my summer tires swapped out for my winter tires.  My regular mechanic was overbooked and there is snow coming on Monday.  Receptionist scheduled me in just fine and the quoted price was reasonable$LABEL$1
Poor service that leaves tenants to fight mildew on their own. When asked to repair something$LABEL$1
Exceptionally poor maintenance service. They refused to start heat before mid-October and the centrally heated apartment grew very chilly as Fall progressed. On another occasion$LABEL$1
I'm a lawyer in NY and I'm visiting a friend in Pittsburgh. I am blown away by the code violations in this unit. The tenants said they have reported these issues to the owner and to no avail. I am hoping to direct these tenants to a lawyer in PA.$LABEL$1
This is one of my two favorite coffeehouses in town. It took me far too long to come around and love Tazza D'oro. A horrible ex of mine loved this place and I admit that this soured me. I regret the time I wasted not going here. The dark wood inside comforts me. The small tables outside are a great place to spend the summer. Tazza D'Oro brews Batdorf and Bronson beans (amazing)$LABEL$5
Tazza D'Oro has a generally European decor$LABEL$5
The coffee here was excellent! Had a double espresso. Apparently their roaster is in Santa Cruz Ca. Large selection of French Press Coffees. Baked goods did not look too great but that is not why I came here. Atmosphere is very mellow and comfortable. Also has Wifi which works! Nice to find a place like this when traveling. Is in the middle of a residential area and there doesnt seem to be anything else around here.$LABEL$5
I love tazza.. Their coffees are excellent and its a great place to enjoy a relaxing evening..I also like their Baklawa$LABEL$5
Best coffee in Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
local$LABEL$5
Reasons:1. LOCATION and setting: Highland Park is simply lovely - makes you feel as if you are in a small English town$LABEL$3
The coffee here is amazing (I love when the baristas take the effort to make patterns in the foam). The baristas were extremely friendly and the pastries looked delicious. While there are a number of tables$LABEL$5
I've read countless 5-star reviews of this coffee shop and I'm sorry$LABEL$3
This is where I learned what good espresso tastes like. If you make it to Highland Park$LABEL$4
I'll preface this by reminding anyone who reads my reviews that 3 stars is a good review for me--it means it's good$LABEL$3
I think the lattes have improved since my last review and their soy cappuccinos are the best I've ever had$LABEL$3
Maybe Tazza D'Oro doesn't need another review$LABEL$4
Still one of the best places to get soy capps$LABEL$3
Great variety of coffee and methods (press$LABEL$4
I had always meant to visit Enrico's$LABEL$4
BEST COFFEE IN PITTSBURGH!You might think there is better coffee elsewhere.  You're wrong!I love this coffee shop$LABEL$5
Best coffee it Pittsburgh? Maybe$LABEL$4
This is a quiet little nook in Highland Park that is perfect for tea$LABEL$4
Really hard to find a good cup of coffee in the states... I'd say this is the best  cappuccino I've had since Italy.$LABEL$5
So I went on a marathon 2 hour bike ride right before heading to Enrico's for the first time and on my last mile all I could think was \""iced caffe mocha$LABEL$3
The coffee was ok$LABEL$2
We ordered a double espresso which looked more like a single shot. Cozy coffeeshop with an ample amount of seating.There were different types of coffee available for purchase to drink there and beans to take home.Cute neighborhood coffeeshop type feel.$LABEL$3
I adore this place! The light green walls are serene$LABEL$5
The people who work here are very rude. I have gone back a few times thinking it may have just been the person working that day was just a rude person$LABEL$1
Best Cafe in Pittsburgh - like a hidden gem. The sandwiches are delicious$LABEL$4
went in as a guest of a friend of mine who is a member there... nice atmosphere.  LOT of oldddd folks and they seem to market themselves as \""Silver Fitness\"" sort of fitness center... (this may be a turn-off for some younger people.)they had a lot of machines and exercise gear ... 2 pools and tan beds/etc /etc.  i'd probably prefer personally to work out somewhere with a younger crowd.$LABEL$3
This is not a review on this gym. It is a review on their customer/membership service. I just called there. All I wanted to know is what their monthly fees were. Simple right? Wrong. They want your name and phone number and the rights to your first born child and then they won't even tell you anything without you physically coming to them to \""talk\"" about what's best for you. I took psychology classes$LABEL$2
I'm a gym guy. I go 3 or 4 times a week among other workouts and activities. ProsAlways towelsVery cleanAlways cardio equipment openPools/hot tubLots of lockersFriendly staffLots of classesLots of free wightsNext to target and trader joesEven during peek hours it's never over crowdedConsWhen the old lady's come in they take up all the parking spots some how. But that's not the gyms faultOnly one flat bench pressSince they have pools and a kids activities some times kids wonder into the wight areasSo in the end more pros then cons.This is more just nit picking but as all gyms have them. There are a few weirdos who are members and just take up space more then workout but oh well what can ya do about it.$LABEL$4
Delicious wings - sometimes a bit too deep fried for my taste$LABEL$3
The food here is okay.  Wings$LABEL$2
In the last week I've been here twice$LABEL$4
The front serves as a good Pittsburgh sports bar. It's a particularly great place to watch the Penguins in the spring when they open up the front wall. There are lots of HDTV's and there is a good selection of beer. The food$LABEL$2
I've been here quite a few times$LABEL$2
Pretty good bar food.  It's conveniently located and a fun atmosphere.$LABEL$3
I found Buffalo Blues to be merely OK.  I thought that their prices were a bit high for the size of the portions$LABEL$2
Wednesday is Wing night$LABEL$3
Wing night wednesdays! 50 cent price wings and $1 beer at William Penn on Tuesdays and my body is not hurting too badly the next day$LABEL$3
I ate at this restaurant last night with three dining companions.  We decided to sit in the bar area at a high table which had views of the ample number of TV's.  The beer list that they had was nice with about 20 different beers on tap and a nice selection of bottles.  I ended up having the Philly Shackamaximum with my waitress telling me that she preferred the Long Trails Porter.  It was served in a chilled glass and tasted pretty good to me.For dinner we attempted to start off by ordering the Blues BBQ Pork Nachos.  We were told that they did not have any pork and so we were not able to order it.  At this point we were also told that they did not have any veggie burgers as well.  So we started out with the Chicken Chili Nachos.  They were pretty good and were covered with real cheese as opposed to nacho cheese which was to my liking.  For dinner I decided on having the Lovely Lisa's Salad since I love both blue cheese and granny smith apples.  Upon receiving the salad I dug in.  The chicken was cooked nicely$LABEL$2
My coworkers and I had lunch here on a Friday afternoon$LABEL$2
The best thing about Buffalo Blues revolves around Sundays during football season. For me$LABEL$3
So$LABEL$3
When Hotlick's died$LABEL$2
Food: 2 stars. It's really not very good. Especially the entirety of the combination platter they make with chicken fingers and wings. Blue cheese wasn't bad though. My wedge salad was enormous- more like a half head of lettuce than a wedge. Nice and fresh though. Drinks: 3 stars$LABEL$4
Oh how the mighty have fallen. This place used to be good. Something happened and the wings are small dry and just generally bad. Since wings are supposed to be their thing this is pretty unacceptable.Writing this review makes me sad because it is a great place to drink beer and watch the game. The beer is reasonably priced but the food is just expensive for what it is. I essentially live across the street so I know I'll go back$LABEL$2
Good fun place to watch games while drinking and eating chicken wings or sandwiches.They have a good selection of wings and decent beer. I try different kinds of wings  every time  I go in but so far spicy garlic has been my favorite. This is a typical sports bar.$LABEL$4
Good place to watch a sports game.  Beer specials were good. Food is very overpriced though.  The wings are about the worst I've ever had... and I've had alot of wings growing up in Buffalo$LABEL$2
This is the worst service (or worst non-service) I have ever experienced. Since I can't give zero stars$LABEL$1
Their food is okay and beer selection is diverse and good. The problem i have with the place is that Buffalo Bills fans congregate here and cheer on every mediocre play their football team makes$LABEL$3
I hate this place. I have been here many times and I am just finally getting around to writing a review.  Let me state that my wife made me go here tonight because my friends wanted to and she said I need to indulge their interests. Even if they suck. Buffalo Blues is like a Hooters$LABEL$1
Went here this past Saturday afternoon$LABEL$1
Loved the hot vegetarian sandwich. Not easy to find veggie dishes which don't feel like a compromise. This was great. Excellent service from waitress Ariella with the long black pony tail (don't know her last name). Nice casual atmosphere. Resonable prices.$LABEL$4
I have a love-hate relationship with this place...  I love it because it's extremely close to me (so$LABEL$2
I have mixed feelings about this place.  I'll say up front: I only ever go there on Sundays for football$LABEL$3
To be honest$LABEL$1
Unfortunately$LABEL$1
I would take advantage of All you can eat wings on Wednesday. We went on a regular oll Sunday night and even though the wings were tasty$LABEL$3
I've been to Buffalo Blues a few times at Happy Hour$LABEL$1
This is my go-to place for curing a hangover. I don't know what it is about Chinese buffets the day after a long night of round after round$LABEL$3
The food here is good but it is not exceptional.  I've been to this restaurant occasionally for a couple years and the menu hasn't changed at all. There is the typical Asian fare such as General Tso's$LABEL$3
Just ate there$LABEL$3
The location is convenient but I was not a fan of the food. I had shrimp and Chinese veggies and crab Rangoon. They cut the veggies way too big and the sauce was bland. I won't go back for food but the crab Rangoon was ok. They didn't give any sauce. You have to ask for it. That sucks.$LABEL$2
This is an average Chinese buffet. The food was not bad$LABEL$2
I think 2 or 3 stars is accurate for this joint... The chicken is quality meat and its lightly saut\u00e9ed but the sauce is to blah. It's a nice place to sit down and have Chinese food if you have no other local options.  It's my last resort for Chinese food in the area. Prices are absurd!!!$LABEL$3
That is a great cat they have working$LABEL$1
Smiley's is wonderful... filled with things to keep our trio of cats well-fed$LABEL$5
Dr. Eric Segal was a complete ass. He was rude and obnoxious to me and my wife. We went to him for an adjustment and I left wanting to adjust this idiot's face. I will deter all of my clients from going here and will personally make sure that this man doesn't disrespect anyone else like he did to us.$LABEL$1
I had to get new tires mounted and balanced and when I went to pay$LABEL$2
Made an appointment for 3:30. They completely forgot I was coming but said they could start on my car in ten minutes and be done in an hour. Came back an hour later only to see my car in the same spot. They said it would take another two hours to start work. Completely unhelpful and unapologetic.$LABEL$1
I came in with a flat.  They said they couldn't repair the tire because there was cracking on the edges.  True there were cracks$LABEL$1
I came in here to have a diagnosis done on my car because the ABS light was on. They removed all the tires$LABEL$1
I knew I needed new tires and an alignment so I ordered the tires ahead so I could be in-and-out as quickly as possible to make it to class. Showed up noone had ordered the tires but they said they'd split the difference of a different brand. I was a little irritated but agreed and thought this was going to be a bad decision coming here (I'm from out of town); however$LABEL$3
I took a subaru outback here for the annual state safety and emissions inspections.  First I was charged more for this service than what was clearly posted on the service station wall.  Secondly I was failed for a lug nut that had rusted to the point that the technicians could not get it off.   I was quoted $425 for them to get it off.  I was able to accomplish this with a $6 bottle of penetrating oil and a breaker bar.  When I returned to have the reinspection I was charged for it (their policy posted on the service wall clearly states you get a second inspection within 30 days of initially failing free of charge).  This time they were able to get the lug nut off but supposedly could not get it back on.  This was odd as I had taken it off and put it back on numerous times to ensure it was okay to pass.  They once again quoted me $425$LABEL$1
Have taken my car here a few times because there's a bus stop out front so it's convenient to drop my car off and get to work. But after what happened I will never be back. They just cost me money and lost my tires. In March I blew a tire on a pothole (naturally) and they replaced the two front tires for me. The second tire was fine but you have to replace both$LABEL$1
Ah Monro$LABEL$1
I wish we had a way to hold this corporation accountable for its crimes against our society.$LABEL$1
Please go to the other McDonalds (not too far from here at 120 Penn Cir W).One time while using their drive-thru service$LABEL$1
Good for Altar bar. But they didn't have fries....$LABEL$3
Prepare to be wowed. High class dining in one of pittsburgh's up and coming hip neighborhoods. I thought I would try some of the world famous cuisine so I pulled up on a Thursday evening. \""Gar\u00e7on\"" I asked$LABEL$1
The most important quality a mechanic can have is honesty. Meet Tim Walter. When I take my car to Walter's I know the service will be good$LABEL$5
I just want to echo what everyone else has already said about this mechanic.  My brakes gave out and I came upon the glowing reviews for Walter's$LABEL$5
Scenario: Get into my car at 3:30 and head to campus for a meeting. All of a sudden$LABEL$5
Great place. I take my car there for everything. Inexpensive$LABEL$5
I thought I need an alignment and turns out all I needed was a tire balance. I stopped by he had me go with him and we drove around the block. I didn't cost me a thing because the tire balance was under warranty. Really  nice guy.$LABEL$5
I had to get a new mechanic since I recently moved here. That worried me$LABEL$5
Hands down a great experience! I called yesterday as the driver headlight on my car was out and asked if I needed to make an appointment. The woman on the phone said to just stop right by during their hours. I went by this morning and their (small) lot was full so I just sat in my car while I believe who was Tim was finished chatting with another guy. I continued to sat in my car for a couple of minutes while Tim quickly inspected my headlight. Unfortunately he did not have any replacement bulbs but ordered them right on the spot while I was there and told me to come back any time in the afternoon. Fast forward a few hours later. I  just popped by and after popping my hood and going into their office to pay$LABEL$5
I have an older car and so sometimes things go wonky. One night I had to drop it off because it was barely running and I had no idea why. This was the first time I went to Walter's$LABEL$5
Honest. Reliable. Trust Worthy.Tim goes above and beyond with his service. He came to my house 3x one day to check everything he could before I ended up towing it to the garage. I will definitely go back!$LABEL$5
Extremely honest$LABEL$5
The Kelly Strayhorn is a good idea which is poorly executed.  The facility has problems:  the stairs on the house are too narrow causing trips$LABEL$2
Named for Pittsburgh greats$LABEL$5
Plays well with a Tazza latte around the corner! The quiche was divine and the the biscuits were what I imagine my mom would have made had she actually made biscuits. Two words: YUM-OH! Cannot wait to return to the Steel City so I can partake in some of the desserts.$LABEL$5
This place has probably some of the best pastries I've ever encountered.  The treats are consistently great to amazing to even mouth watering.  The bakery is this quaint little place that is really cute with nice baking decorations and everything.  The staff is really friendly and always helpful with making the hard selection.  The cupcakes are these cream-stuffed pieces of heaven$LABEL$5
I arrived on a Thursday afternoon at 5pm when there was absolutely no other soul in the bakery (except for the staff). My pumpkin pastry with carmel topping was alright. I also tried the key lime cake and sour cream and apple cake. The key lime cake was definitely the best of the three.While I've been to better bakeries$LABEL$2
My sister$LABEL$5
Food glorious foooood$LABEL$5
Came across this place after checking out a Thai restaurant across the street. The name intrigued my family and I$LABEL$5
I've had a wide range of experiences here.  Let's just say$LABEL$2
I have to say that I have had quick and efficient stops in here for all of my car needs. Firstly$LABEL$4
I moved to Pgh from San Francisco in 2010$LABEL$5
Among the best of the 'burgh.  Great live acts on a regular basis.$LABEL$5
Dear Shadow Lounge$LABEL$5
As a Brooklyn based live indie-electronic/hiphop performer that travels$LABEL$5
Great club/bar/lounge/venue. Great mix of people and music with decent bartenders and good prices on beer.$LABEL$3
Went several nights in a row: Thursday$LABEL$5
Absolutely amazing! Great staff and service! Best music in Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
One of the most eclectic venues in Pittsburgh. Shadow Lounge has a great variety of acts that it pulls in.I just went to their Titletown Soul & Funk Party and it was a really great time. Great music$LABEL$5
There were zero other people here aside from my friend and I.$LABEL$2
i was here for a concert the other night. apparently$LABEL$2
It's surprising how long it took me to get here$LABEL$4
I love this store. I can just spend hours walking around getting ideas of things to either update or change around my house.All of the sales associates are very helpful and knowledgeable. Sometimes it's hard to find someone to help you because they are busy helping other customers.They even cut keys that actually work.$LABEL$5
I love hardware stores.  LOVE.  But this Home Depot has disappointed me.  The location is great$LABEL$3
This was my first time to this Home Depot.  Very impressed with the customer service here.  We were redoing a bathroom and went in for more tiles.  They were out of them.  However$LABEL$3
Fish out of water here when it comes to hardware related things.  I mean I know how to swing a hammer and push a button to start a machine$LABEL$2
This is a pretty good HD. It is somewhat smaller than the ones in Ross Park and Monroeville$LABEL$3
I would rather drive out of my way to another Home Depot than give this location my business. Employees are unhelpful and the most of them are too busy talking to each other and complaining about their jobs to notice you're standing there in front of them. Strike that... I'm certain they notice$LABEL$1
Most of the home depots i've seen are the same and that includes this one. aisles full of hardware supplies$LABEL$3
What has happened to the East Liberty Home Depot?  It used to be my \""go-to\"" place for everything DIY$LABEL$1
Waiting 20 minutes to get one piece of wood cut in an empty store on a Friday afternoon.  Priceless!$LABEL$1
Fairly mediocre$LABEL$2
Tried using the online order store pickup with the hopes of increased efficiency.  fail.$LABEL$2
Most definitely$LABEL$4
A few hours before the event$LABEL$2
I went to a yelp event here$LABEL$5
Got my hair done in an updo (for only $25!!!!)  yesterday for my wedding.  they did amazing!  they listened to what i wanted and although it took quite a while (i have really long hair) she spent the time to do it right and exactly how i wanted it.  great service!!   The price is not high but the quality is!$LABEL$5
Great for a quick cut.  $22 for extreme attention to detail and excellent finish.$LABEL$5
This is the greasiest pizza I've ever had in Pittsburgh$LABEL$1
Provolone sticks arrived undercooked$LABEL$1
Worst pizza I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered from here last weekend. The pizza (pepperoni) had no flavor and the crust was way too chewy. The Buffalo wings were cooked well$LABEL$2
I order from these guys on campusfood.comThey are pretty good .. i get my order on time and their quality has been pretty consistentI mostly get things like hoagies and pizzas.. they are pretty decentThis place is pretty convenient for me when I am working on campus late at night when most other places have shut down.$LABEL$4
Great Hoagies! I always get the Steak Deluxe hoagie and my wife gets the Italian Deluxe and then we give each other half of the other ones hoagie because we can never decide on with one to get.$LABEL$5
Ahh$LABEL$2
I had some pizza from Pizza Parma today during a lunch meeting at work.  A colleague brought it in$LABEL$3
Pizza Parma has many of the characteristics I like in a pizza joint. 1) They deliver when they say they will$LABEL$3
I like the pizza and the selection of toppings.  They are reliable.  Great option for take out food.$LABEL$3
This was one of first pizza places that I've tried inPittsburgh. It was about 5 years ago. I don't have a clear memory of that time but I have Parma pizza phobia ever since... So go figure...$LABEL$2
I've should have known better than to order a salad from a pizza joint.  I also should have known that I shouldn't have cheated on my diet.I figured I'd choose today to be my cheat day and order with everyone else at work for take out.  I opted for the Popcorn Chicken Salad.  Sounds tasty$LABEL$2
Three stars is super accurate for this place. We decided to do take out from here after walking by it a hundred times after the gym and hearing radio commercials about it from that god forsaken BUBBA SHOW (does that plug raise anyone else's blood pressure??) Our order was ready in 15 minutes (speedy!) and we got a large 1 topping pizza for ~$8 and a side of fries. All together like $13 for three people$LABEL$3
Pizza Parma delivers through GrubHub$LABEL$3
Great friendly service and my order was done fast$LABEL$3
When my boyfriend and I were down with the flu$LABEL$1
Some friends and I ordered a couple of pizzas for delivery from here tonight.  We'd bought a few growlers of hard cider from a local establishment$LABEL$3
This place is bright and clean and I've seen staff taking care of machines every time I've been there (different times/different days) so I imagine it's well maintained in general.  Love that there are bus stops directly in front of and across the street AND that this is a 24-hour place.  I usually spend $7.50 every 2 weeks* though I could probably get away with using the single load machines and a few minutes less in the dryer.  I especially appreciate the good spin cycle from these washers as that means less time it has to be in the dryer!Around here$LABEL$3
I was all set to want to give this place 3 stars simply because another laundry place put me in a bind and this place was open 24 hrs.  I thought the late hours alone should give it a star. Then I had this experience--Poor ventilation I could barely breath its cramped and small with dryers and washers lining two narrow corridors. ---- misleading advertising it boasts \""high capacity\"" washers an says its air conditioned$LABEL$1
So$LABEL$3
I think the only thing I appreciate about Whole Foods is entering the store and seeing their fresh cut flowers.  Let's see why.....I attempt to drive to Whole Foods only to be caught in a line of 5-6 cars attempting to get into the parking lot.  (I guess I'm not cool enough to ride Pat Transit from the South Pittsburgh home).  When I find a place to park$LABEL$2
I don't know$LABEL$2
I loved Whole Foods in Ohio.  It was calm and quiet and had lots of pretty organic produce.Here?  Well$LABEL$2
Everybody$LABEL$3
AH!  I am never shopping anywhere else for groceries ever again (except if I want like ketchup and bologna and stuff-- then I'll have to go to giant eagle.)  But$LABEL$5
Whole paycheck is a fitting name.This Whole Foods is decent for regular items but their prepared food prices have gotten really high as of late.  I used to shop here for almost everything but their common products can now be had at almost any other grocery store for less.Whole Foods had it's day as a unique place to shop with hard to find organic produce and products. Now it's just more expensive.$LABEL$2
Compared to other Whole Foods locations$LABEL$4
Hello!I work pretty close to Whole Foods so I frequent it about 3-4 times a week for lunch. If you're there M-F between 12-1$LABEL$4
3.5 stars$LABEL$3
Worst parking lot in Pittsburgh. Bring popcorn to watch middle-aged$LABEL$2
Food poisoning a la Tomato Bisque Soup.Forever skeptical.That's too bad$LABEL$1
Great selection of vegan$LABEL$2
everything is a cluster.  the store.  the parking lot.  the people -- customers included.  full-on cluster. barely any parking for a massive$LABEL$1
MEAN CUSTOMERS -ALOOF WORKERS+GOOD FOOD = CRAZY!Official Rant of an Angry Woman:First off - I shop at \""Whole Paycheck\"" cause my household eats organic and whether I like it or not WF has the best organic food prices in my neck of the woods. IT'S STILL GOD DAMN RIDICULOUS EXPENSIVE but I take my family units nutrition and health seriously! WORD!!Downhill from here...THE CUSTOMERS AND PARKING LOT ARE MORE BAT SHIT CRAZY THAN MENTAL HOSPITALS I'VE WORKED AT!I have watched more rich bitch elderly women NEARLY murder pedestrians and crash into cars trying to park their Lincoln Continentals in that parking lot than I'd ever care to witness!Also - I am a mother with a young child and have been SHOVED by above mentioned rich bitches while reaching for products out of the freezer cases WITH MY CHILD IN MY ARMS! I briefly entertained SHANKING said bitch but alas prison orange is not in my color wheel!The customers are the worst human beings on earth (::thinks about self$LABEL$2
Oh Whole Foods$LABEL$2
the parking lot @ this wholefoods is an ABOMINATION!  to compound the issue$LABEL$1
Short and sweet$LABEL$3
I like this Whole Foods location. I will tell you why.Many Yelpers have docked stars for the parking lot. I think that's irrelevant. The parking lot$LABEL$4
I am a big fan of the Whole Foods company in general.  The store back home (Omaha) had a wine bar$LABEL$2
Parking is tough$LABEL$4
I have tried Whole Foods recently even after hearing about the attitude of the butthole$LABEL$1
I always thought 1-star reviews on Yelp were written by bitter$LABEL$1
This review is for the buffet at Whole Foods. Overall$LABEL$4
I'll be honest$LABEL$2
NO WI-FI.  Just FYI.  When I lived in Cleveland and my first (truly terrible) apartment had no wi-fi Whole Foods was my second home...I would buy a little sampler of buffet foods and salads$LABEL$3
I love shopping here. The staff is really nice$LABEL$5
I loved it$LABEL$1
This store is great - it's got all of the fresh specialty items we need for cooking great weekend meals for friends$LABEL$3
I think Whole Foods and Giant Eagle Market District are competing for the title of most annoying place to shop. It all starts with the parking experience$LABEL$2
This store is pretty good. Yes it is fairly expensive but you can get quite a few items that are difficult if not impossible to find at other stores. They have a nice meat department with quite a few good naturally raised products$LABEL$3
Just wanted to write a review based on my experience today.Everything I went for was in stock today (which doesn't always happen). The place was crowded$LABEL$4
I love everything that Whole Foods offers$LABEL$3
So..... when I think about shopping at Whole Foods$LABEL$3
I love Whole Foods$LABEL$4
My expectations for Whole Foods Market had been established as was growing up in the DMV (D.C.$LABEL$3
I will start by saying this review is for the hot bar and I must of gone at an off hour for the hot bar and by that I mean during the dinner rush before they replenished it. I would say everything I got from the salad bar to the hot bar was good apart from they had run out of soup/special of the day and the chicken was beyond dry$LABEL$3
Yes$LABEL$4
As a vegan (since 2008) we are a regular at whole foods. It's convenient since we live in Lawrenceville. My one and biggest complaint is that they need to carry more (if not all) organic produce. Not this \""conventional\"" garbage. Other than that they have a huge variety of products and grocery items to choose from. Staff is always friendly and helpful.$LABEL$4
Alright$LABEL$5
I went here to get my serpentine belt replaced and a transmission flushed and these guys were friendly and efficient.  They took the time to explain things to me and I felt comfortable that they were making the appropriate recommendations without trying to charge me for things I didn't need.  It was ready in just a few hours as promised so I was able to pick it up same day.  Only complaint is that they left my transmission fluid dipstick out of place under the hood so it was just laying on top$LABEL$4
If I could give them zero stars$LABEL$1
This club is now officially closed for good due to redevelopment in the area.$LABEL$2
Hats? They got some sweet stuff. Shirts? Stuff you won't get anywhere else. Socks? They got you covered. Great staff and cool location. Go check this place out.$LABEL$4
TimeBomb is without a doubt the best spot in Pittsburgh to get all the exclusive Raw street merchandise. This is my favorite store in the city not only because of it's selection of merchandise$LABEL$5
Jimmy Tsang's Chinese Restaurant is one of the old \""traditional\"" Pittsburgh restaurants$LABEL$3
Walking into Jimmy Tsang's was like walking into the Chinese restaurant that was on Hawaii Five-0 - it puts you back in time to the 1960's and the food is reminiscent of that era also.Hot & Sour soup was highly americanized$LABEL$2
I really feel bad about giving a one-star review.  First$LABEL$1
Hey$LABEL$2
Went there last night with 8 peeople. There was another 14 people party.The food was good -- not great but good. We waited 45 minutes for the first dish to arrive and that only because we sent one of our folk to see what was going on. They did bring drinks and tea promptly.$LABEL$3
Closed.  Signage down.  Boarded up tight.  Phone disconnected.$LABEL$1
Yep$LABEL$3
I first found the Newman Chiropractic Center about 2 years ago when one day$LABEL$5
Great stuff here...The cheese plates are great and always changing. Awesome staff$LABEL$4
This place used to have a great bar/tapas menu with a decent selection of happy hour wine specials.  Now...  not so much.  Well$LABEL$4
As the reviews of Casbah appear to be particularly long-winded ... the place is nice$LABEL$5
The food here is pretty good.  Comparable to any 3 to 3.5 star restaurant.  The lamb is definitely good.  And it is definitely a good date restaurant.  I would rather give it 3.5 stars since I've definitely eaten at better restaurants. But for Pittsburgh$LABEL$4
Can be moderately priced for lunch -- take advantage!  We had a cheese tasting simply because I *never* pass up Pleasant Ridge Reserve when given the opportunity.  They also choose a lovely soft sheep's milk and an herbed goat cheese from Cypress Grove.  Nice work but pricey -- only two slices of baguette and apple!  I had the romaine salad -- should have gone with a sandwich and the delicious looking truffle fries!  The feta and red pepper dressing were just too salty and rich for 1pm.  I spied a number of delicious looking sandwiches from my table...Service was great and the waiter even went out of his way to answer a couple questions about the cheese selection.$LABEL$4
Another great big burrito restaurant$LABEL$4
Meh.  Seriously?  Mediterranean?  What?  Sorry$LABEL$3
Amazing brunch! I'd never been to Casbah before until this past Sunday when we decided to check it out for their prix-fixe menu.For $22$LABEL$4
There is a disconnect here between this name$LABEL$4
This is my favorite Big Burrito restaurant and definitely one of my favorite restaurants in the country. Gotta be honest$LABEL$5
I was determined to let this one pass (experience was not worth commentary) until I made a disturbing discovery...I made a reservation for inside. They sat us outside. That turned out to be preferable to us because the tables that WERE available inside were very close to others. The patio was spacious and decorated with busts$LABEL$2
My boyfriend took me to Casbah for my birthday this March. This is one of our twice-a-year splurges and I have been wanted to go to this restaurant for ages.We were seated outside$LABEL$4
For our last lunch in Pittsburgh we decided to return to the Big Burrito Group; Eleven was quite good and both Gayot and Pittsburgh Magazine compared the experience at Casbah favorably to that of Big Burrito's crown jewel.  Citing a mix of Mediterranean and Northern African influences with a bargain Piccola Gusto Menu for lunch and the option for indoor or al fresco dining it seemed as if Casbah was a can't miss option...well$LABEL$1
great atmosphere and great food. while the menu changes seasonally$LABEL$4
I've been here twice now$LABEL$4
Very tasty food and drinks! Its a little pricey$LABEL$3
The interior is very nice. The food is a hit or miss. We went for brunch today. You can select a drink (alcoholic or non)$LABEL$3
Disappointing. My bf and I went for JUST dessert and wine$LABEL$2
I have to agree with the \""hit or miss\"" reviewers about Casbah$LABEL$3
I came here with a friend for her birthday$LABEL$2
My husband and I went to Casbah to celebrate my birthday one evening.  We were seated on the patio which was fine before a party of 20 was seated with a 1 year old who was banging his silverware on the table all night.  So much for romantic!  Ever hear of a babysitter?  Anyway$LABEL$3
I finally went to Casbah for brunch today. Rolled in at 10am to meet a handful of people. Because it is Labor Day weekend$LABEL$3
Passed this restaurant for years on my way to Buffalo Blues or more recently Mad Mex but have never actually eaten here.  Having finally come for lunch$LABEL$3
This place was recommended by an employee at Evolve spa across the street and I was very happy with the restaurant. The Salmon appetizer was delicious as was the gnocchi meal. I will definitely go back to this restaurant when I visit the area.$LABEL$4
Food phenomenal! Service can be hit or miss.$LABEL$4
1. Sat outside on patio metallic chairs and tables$LABEL$2
Overall a good experience. Food was mostly very good. My sweet pea risotto was just OK. My wife's short rib ravioli was creative and very tasty. Neither of us are big eaters$LABEL$4
Sharia don't like it$LABEL$2
I had a free entree from Big Burrito for my birthday$LABEL$3
I was treated to Casbah for lunch by a potential employer who had passed me over$LABEL$3
I'm actually giving it 3.5 stars.  3 for the appetizers and 4 for the entrees.  My wife and I went to Casbah for the first time.  As we usually do$LABEL$3
Hard to remember another restaurant that hit home runs from start to finish.  Yinzes say it's pricey but I disagree$LABEL$5
Service is a little slow but overall the best food I've had in Pittsburgh so far. If you're a seafood fan$LABEL$4
casbah is the last big burrito restaurant i had left to try and i really liked it. i started with the sangria to drink which was delicious$LABEL$5
Casbah is definitely my favorite restaurant in P-burgh; in fact$LABEL$5
My wife and I go to Casbah every year for my birthday. It is my favorite of the Big  Burrito restaurants$LABEL$5
Glad to see that the Big Burrito restaurants are alive and well in Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
When scoping around online for a good NYE dinner destination for my husband and me$LABEL$4
Brunch = best in the burgh.  Hands down.  Best. eggs. ever. I am not even sure how the eggs can be that good.  I know what you are saying$LABEL$5
- Great food. I had the Gerber's Amish Farm Chicken Breast and it was cooked perfectly and delicious =]- Nice wine selection. Though I'm a beer guy.- Friendly staff.- Okay atmosphere.This place is definitely worth trying. Will be back for seconds!$LABEL$4
Hey do I really need to review this place? Look at the previous reviews but I will let you know that they have a great lunch deal$LABEL$4
Good food$LABEL$2
Not a good vegan experience.  We were meeting friends at Casbah for dinner -their choice.  Since I follow a version of vegan$LABEL$1
Love this place. I've never had anything that wasn't tasty here. They do fish and meat very well. It's not obscure molecular gastronomy style$LABEL$4
Oh I love this place.  It has a great menu and wine list.  It has all the great dishes with a touch of flare.  I took this meal to seafood town from start to finish and have no regrets.  The staff was really friendly - realized I was there for a special occasion and brought out a desert that said congratulations - the little things.We dined outside and I felt tucked away in a Europe-esque atmosphere for a few hours.It is worth reserving a spot on the patio to get the full experience.$LABEL$5
A delicious menu with a twist. Unique wine list too!$LABEL$4
Though Casbah has been around for ages this was our first time dining there. In short$LABEL$2
Love Casbah.  Been going there for years and have never had a less than great meal and service.  OF course their signature lamb is to die for (with the Stag's Leap Petite Syrah).  What can I say -- the cheese plate is great.  Everything is well-prepared and the service is among the best in the -burgh.$LABEL$5
Casbah is fast becoming my favorite restaurant in Pittsburgh. I have been there twice now and both times the service and food was impeccable. The calamari and the proscuitto appetizer are a great start to the meal and not too heavy or filling and I could eat a whole basket of the warm bread. I'd love to know where they get it from as I can't imagine they bake it there$LABEL$5
My absolutely favorite dish is the potato gnocchi. Just amazing! Service is fantastic$LABEL$5
Tonight's review: it started with a table for two stuffed between two other tables. Yes there were five other more comfortable two tops available. We asked and after some sighs were granted our seemingly offensive request. Punishment was fast...we sipped our water$LABEL$2
Visited for brunch again on a rainy winter Sunday.  I reaffirm my previous comments.Good service.  Generally great food (the breakfast pastries$LABEL$4
I recently realized that I had only given Casbah four stars after my first visit here for New Year's Eve 2012... What a terrible judgment call that was on my part. So I'm back to proclaim that over a year later - having dined here again in 2013 - with a year of dining experiences across the country -  I still regularly dream of this restaurant. Do I dare say it's my favorite restaurant? I'm not sure$LABEL$5
I have a soft spot for this place -- probably because it is one of the first restaurants my fiance ever took me to$LABEL$5
I am definitely the salt queen.  I literally salt everything from pizza$LABEL$4
Best \""Babaganoush\"" we've had since we visited Egypt.The gaspacho soup was fantastic$LABEL$5
The food here was absolute perfection; each bite was perfectly orchestrated to deliver optimal flavor and enjoyment. The service was also fantastic!For my entree$LABEL$5
Made a reservation on opentable for Friday at 6pm.  It wasn't packed at all but the hostess decided to sit us outside without asking where we'd prefer to sit. It was really hot that day so it was pretty uncomfortable. I immediately noticed that a lot of CMU undergrads worked there. While I was dining there I saw 3 CMU classmates. I started off with the gazpacho and it was very tasty. We were also given some bread with a lavender goat cheese spread. The spread was ok. For the entrees I got the roasted pepper cavereccia that had crab in it and ricotta cavatelli with sausage.For the cavereccia I thought there was going to be big chunks of crab but I was disappointed to see that the crab was shredded into small pieces. The pasta was a little undercooked and the sauce was ok.The cavatelli was extremely oily. The more you ate it the more you saw the pool of oil it was swimming in. I had to wipe some of the oil off the pasta. Lastly I had the dark chocolate raspberry bread pudding. It was pretty good but I wish there were more raspberries in it. Service was pretty good and the decor outside was nice$LABEL$2
I took my boyfriend to Casbah at the end of September for his birthday. We were seated near the door for our reservation however it was a very warm night so it was nice to sit in an open air setting. Our server$LABEL$5
This might be the best food I've had in Pittsburgh.The restaurant set up is a little odd in that there is a tented outdoor space that you walk through to get to the hostess stand. The hostess stand is located in the indoor space. We were seated in the outdoor section in a corner which was fairly drafty. This is the only negative point I have about the meal.We ordered the cheese  tasting menu$LABEL$4
This update is for Casbah's brunch.Alright$LABEL$5
While I have always had a great experience with my food$LABEL$2
Let me say that my five stars are based primarily on the calamari appetizer ... it is SOOO good! The squid was very lightly battered and fried so briefly that it was tender and delicious. Seriously$LABEL$5
Upon receipt of the much-coveted Big Burrito birthday voucher$LABEL$5
Three strikes and you're out!  We had brunch there a few months back$LABEL$1
Casbah continues to be my favorite Pittsburgh restaurant. High quality service and creative dishes. Sign up for mailers for Big Burrito special offers and birthday discount.  Must try:CalamariCheese plateShort Rib RavioliPork ChopWatermelon Gin Fizz$LABEL$5
Mixed results.  Made a reservation and we were seated in a dark corner at a tiny table. Is the money from having that table worth the negative experience guests will receive? Methinks not.  I had to ask to be moved to the patio$LABEL$3
Though I didn't get a chance to visit this place when I visited last month$LABEL$4
I used to live about four blocks from the Quiet Storm$LABEL$5
Wondering where the Pittsburgh hipster crowd hangs out? Look no further than the fixie parked outside the Quiet Storm. And then go inside and have some delicious food and drink.$LABEL$4
This place is cool!  But it is also 'cool'.  Service is so-so$LABEL$4
It's good when they are on$LABEL$2
Food is tasty$LABEL$3
Solid Milkshakes and Falafel - block from my house$LABEL$4
CASH ONLY!!!  What a pleasant surprise!  I went here for the first time last night and wasn't sure what to expect when i walked in.  The place seems to have some spacial issues.  There was a bar but they don't serve alcohol$LABEL$5
Quiet Storm is$LABEL$2
pretty good veggie food.  I've had breakfast$LABEL$3
I must be a glutton for punishment$LABEL$1
Well$LABEL$1
i was super excited to try quiet storm when i moved to pittsburgh because all of the reviews i read were fantastic.  however$LABEL$2
We go here all the time and have ordered almost everything on the menu and never been disappointed. It's veggie diner food at it's best (at least in my opinion). My bf is a meat & potatoes man but he absolutely loves the breakfast  Homefries with tofu instead of eggs. The waitstaff have always been exceptionally nice and very attentive. This establishment is best described as a greasy spoon for vegans and vegetarians so if you go in expecting gourmet$LABEL$4
Aw it's places like this that make me love Pittsburgh. Its hodge podge decor and hipster crowd are what drew me here in the first place$LABEL$4
This place is so hit-or-miss for me. Sometimes the food is amazing; sometimes it is terrible. Example: I ordered the spicy peanut wrap for the first time and fell in love with it. I came back a couple weeks later$LABEL$3
Remember the days of bands in the back at night$LABEL$3
The menu looks awesome and the dish concepts are good except everything that comes out is disappointingly bland. Thank god there were bottles of hot sauce and salt on the table. The best part of the meal was the peanut butter chocolate milk shake. The burger and \""spicy\"" Cajun soup were very mediocre.$LABEL$2
I'm a vegetarian and have lived behind the restaurant for over 3 years. Every time I have ever gone$LABEL$1
Quiet storm is a really cool vegetarian restaurant. The time I was there the service was fine and the food was unique. Their menu is a limited on the weekdays$LABEL$4
We stopped by Quiet Storm for a late lunch while on vacation in Pittsburgh.  The food was excellent.  I had the cheese steak and my husband had a peanut tofu wrap$LABEL$3
I didn't realize that Quiet Storm was a completely vegetarian restaurant until I noticed the word \""seitan\"" printed after every meat item on the menu. Normally I'd find this annoying$LABEL$4
Daniel Fast friendly restaurant with good food. Stopped for an early supper before Saturday night church service after searching Yelp for vegan restaurant options. Food was good$LABEL$3
Why do vegetarian restaurants think we need \""fake\"" meat$LABEL$2
I've been back to Quiet Storm many times. I can accept the hit or miss service since it's pretty cheap and casual. That's not really an excuse for bad service$LABEL$2
My experience has been ok at the Quiet Storm because I have 1) not deviated much from my usual menu choice (Original Home Fries = delicious) and 2) I have often known several members of the wait staff at any given time.This has given me reason to continue eating at Quiet Storm on occasion.Negatives... I have eaten with several others over the years who have been wholly dissatisfied with their meals (small portions$LABEL$3
So when we first went here for brunch$LABEL$3
Honestly$LABEL$3
Quiet Storm occupies a special place in my heart compartment because$LABEL$4
They have these tofu tenders$LABEL$4
Despite my 3-star rating$LABEL$3
Yes$LABEL$1
Yes$LABEL$2
I came into Quiet Storm not intending to have lunch$LABEL$3
After three trips to Quiet Storm I am hooked.   I had the Bahn Mi$LABEL$5
So I admit my boyfriend and I actually didn't know it was vegetarian/vegan until we had ordered our food and looked more closely. We went this past weekend and had brunch. We each had thai coffee which was ok$LABEL$2
Ugh... I got a plate with seisage$LABEL$1
My husband and I stopped going here$LABEL$5
Worst tofu scramble ever. Days old$LABEL$1
Nothing matches in this place! The tables$LABEL$5
I've found the service here to be pretty terrible. Servers can be pretty careless about taking care of simple things and my friends have had similar experiences. The food is really pretty good$LABEL$2
Great cafe for brunch and coffee. Lots of vegetarian options and nice atmosphere. Come check out the place if you're in the area and would like to try some healthy foods. Was here for some brunch with friends and our food did take a while to make it to the table but everyone enjoyed their meal. If you come too late during the evenings for dinner the food options are less then what's on the menu.$LABEL$4
Me and my kids got food togo from here$LABEL$4
I love quiet storm! I think it's as good as you can get for vegan cuisine. The country burrito is BOMB! So good$LABEL$5
The Quiet Storm was great. I started with the soup of the day which was something along the lines of a carrot pumpkin curry. It had an unexpected texture but I still quite enjoyed it. For my entr\u00e9e I had the Spinach Burger$LABEL$4
Sandy had me holed up in Pittsburgh looking for a flight and staying with my wife's aunt. She adventurously agreed to go with me to a veggie place and that's how I ended up here. Nice layout with tables along the windows and more in back. If you're not familiar with this kind of scene it could seem a little rundown$LABEL$4
Andrew here said it best: \""...  food served by workers who mostly don't seem to notice they're working$LABEL$2
I'm still not convinced that this is a vegetarian restaurant. It just has to be a parody of a vegetarian restaurant. Like$LABEL$2
I don't think I would have known about Quiet Storm if it hadn't popped up several times in friends' Yelp feeds in the last couple years.  I'm all about veg/vegan restaurants$LABEL$3
I was somewhat worried about going here since the reviews seem to be bimodal$LABEL$5
Quiet Storm is a delicious and cozy little place located in the colorful Bloomfield area. The buildings surrounding Quiet Storm are often painted with cute art or have little interesting things about them. I love this neighborhood$LABEL$5
My friend and I were having a weekend trip to Pittsburgh (first time!) and stopped in for brunch on Sunday before our visit to the nearby Pittsburgh Glass Center. We weren't familiar with the area & this looked like a cute place- ended up definitely enjoying our time here!We weren't aware that it was a vegan place; regardless$LABEL$4
This place is a train wreck. Quiet? No. Storm? Yes. Loud$LABEL$2
Delicious!! Not a vegetarian$LABEL$4
This place is great! Cute inside$LABEL$4
this is the only place I order delivery pizza from.  they do a good job on their gourmet and specialty pizzas.  the bbq chicken is good.the wings are average.  generally small and cheap with a seemingly storebought generic hot sause. nothing terribly special.  averagethe hoagies are ok.  dont get a cold cut or italian style.  I'd stick with something like the hot sausage or chicken parm.  they tend to be better.  and they are huge.  like 16\"" for a whole.the calzones are massive and tasty as well.  go with heavy veg or a combination of meat and veg.  the breaks up the bread and cheese flavor.  well at least I've found them to be better anyway.the pasta is expensive as heck and is average.  not a place to order pasta from unless its one of those lazy nights where you need that craving filled.salads are typical.all in all not a bad place.  better than other pizza places in the area.$LABEL$3
I love N.Y. style pizza.  Could eat it every day.  On a recent to trip to Pittsburgh I tried alot of pizza and this was good pizza.  One thing about Pitt pizza... it is slightly different than true NYC style:  the crust is not as thin and there's a whole lot more cheese.  As a rule Pitt pizza also has a slightly sweeter tomato sauce.  The sum of its parts is still a delicious close cousin to NYC pizza.The pizza I tried in Pitt in my order of favorites:Fiori'sPizza Sola (Penn Circle Branch)Pizza PerfecttaAiello's (Murray Street)Beto'sSave for Beto's$LABEL$4
In all fairness$LABEL$2
My favorite for Pt. Breeze/Pittsburgh East End. Flat New York style$LABEL$5
Great pizza$LABEL$5
This Valentines Day I ordered a pizza for my boyfriend and asked that they make a heart on it out of green peppers. The pizza was great$LABEL$5
By far my favorite Pizza place in the east end.  The buffalo chicken pizza here is fantastic$LABEL$5
I called for a delivery of a pepperoni pizza$LABEL$3
For $10 you can get an 8 inch sub and a GIANT slice of pizza. Needless to say$LABEL$4
DO NOT ORDER THE HOT WINGS!! If you enjoy eating hot sauce flavored gravy paste$LABEL$2
Got the rancho and the Greek$LABEL$2
I've really enjoyed their pizza so far. I also ordered a chicken salad and it was tasty for a pizza take out place$LABEL$4
The food and customer service from this restaurant are really top notch.  I am continually impressed with how fast the delivery is and how likeable the drivers are.The pizzas here are excellent as long as you don't get the \""crab meat\"" topping (I should have expected gross imitation crab meat since we're so far from the coast).The breadsticks$LABEL$4
I was pretty disappointed with this place. I thought from the good reviews that the pizza would taste okay. I went here around 12am on a Friday so maybe their ingredients weren't as fresh. I ordered a medium veggie pizza with a side of fries. The fries were super soggy and the pizza was pretty flavorless. There are only about 2 seats inside so you pretty much have to take it to go which was fine with me. The people working there are really nice though which is a plus. Overall$LABEL$1
All around delicious pizza$LABEL$4
They have inaccurate hours posted. I tried to order at 11:30 pm when yelp says they close at 2am and they were already closed. When I told them they have inaccurate hours posted the guy on the phone said \""oh that's ok....\"" And hung up on me. I will never be ordering from them again$LABEL$1
I was a bit disappointed with the pizza I got. I ordered the Milano special pizza$LABEL$2
I moved to PGH about 3 years ago with my cat and was nervous about finding a new vet. My previous vet in NY was just wonderful and I was doubtful that I would find another as good or as caring as her. Over the past 3 years I have taken my cat there not only for his yearly's but for other heatlth issues and was alway met with caring staff. Dr. Simard is my favorite vet there$LABEL$5
I took my cat here for a preliminary checkup after adopting her from the animal shelter & then again to have her declawed. I was very impressed by the facilities and service. The facilities are spotless & modern$LABEL$5
The vet met with us for a very short amount of time. She was rushed$LABEL$1
I guess I'm getting burned out on winter.  That's what made me think about this place.  See$LABEL$4
There is nothing better than a neighborhood market$LABEL$5
anything you need you can find it at the market :)$LABEL$5
I like this place; it single-handedly made me hate Pittsburgh just a little less.  In fact$LABEL$4
As a displaced west-coaster$LABEL$4
This is a good co-op$LABEL$4
There is nothing like this in chicago!  (that I know of).....I hope I get to stay in Pittsburgh long enough just to take advantage of this co-op.  I love the bulk section$LABEL$5
Kind of small$LABEL$4
This place has steadily improved over the years$LABEL$4
Lots of great vegan$LABEL$4
Just moved here from Baltimore and ran across this place.  Love it!  Watch yourself at the hot bar.  There's no scale (should be).  Your mea l(of veggies$LABEL$4
Ooooppss...update time.   Got the regular (steamed spinach and lasagna) from the hot bar on my way to work.   So$LABEL$2
I really love this little place. The hot bar is almost always completely wonderful. I especially love the breakfast/brunch on weekends$LABEL$4
It's disappointing that you got lukewarm service$LABEL$4
I just found this place a month back and I'm kind of blown away by how awesome it is. Fresh produce$LABEL$5
I was visiting Pittsburgh and looking for a throat spray called Singers Saving Grace. Whole Foods didn't have the item in stock but East End Co-Op did! Also$LABEL$5
This co-op is probably great for vegans and vegetarians$LABEL$3
Forget Whole Foods when you have East End Cooperative! Honestly$LABEL$5
I have been going to CJ since it opened. I try to go once a week. I have received some good deals there$LABEL$3
just got off the phone with a lady from construction junction.  normally$LABEL$2
12/1/13 got 3 bifold doors for 25 bucks$LABEL$5
I love this place!  You never know what your going to find!  They have all kinds of things$LABEL$5
Very primitive bouldering area$LABEL$3
The blonde woman who tuns the gym was extremely rude to us. First time we went she refused yo.get off the phone on a personal call to help us. Then she gave us the rules for the bouldering area in a rapid bored monotone. Compared to other climbing gyms I have gone to this gym is less safe (no gri-gris)$LABEL$1
Pittsburgh doesn't really have its choice of indoor climbing walls$LABEL$4
I'm giving this the ok rating$LABEL$3
Some helpful hints for the Climbing Wall:-A one-day pass is $12.  College students/active military pay $10.  Wednesday is 1/2 price for ladies (but only after they pay full price on the first visit).  Wednesday is also 1/2 price for guys who wear a sports bra.  Yup$LABEL$5
Went to this place on a Groupon and fell in love. It reminds me of the days when I lived in Denver. I miss it! The routes are decently hard and allow me to push myself to get better. Staff has always been awesome. People there help give pointers. It does get pretty crowded sometimes$LABEL$5
I've been climbing for a few years but have friends who have never climbed. This place has lots of climbs at all different levels so my friends and I can enjoy climbing here together.  Plus they have instructional classes if you want to learn more. It has a great atmosphere - a great place to hang out with friends or meet new people. The staff are amazing! Very nice and very helpful. The prices are very reasonable$LABEL$5
As a new climber I found the whole process intimidating$LABEL$4
I like this place but the hours are inconvenient (top roping doesn't open until 5PM during the week!!!!) I wish they would expand their hours. Otherwise$LABEL$4
Dirty slick holds. Hate the fact I can't move mats. Some problems were fun$LABEL$3
Sub-par setting quality$LABEL$2
Pros:- At least there's a climbing gym in this area- Walls get reset oftenCons:- I've been coming here a couple times a week for the past few months now$LABEL$1
I was home for the holidays and wanted to take some friends of mine climbing.  They've never belayed and don't have equipment so my hope was that we could go$LABEL$1
There are some really good things to say about the climbing wall$LABEL$2
Don't go. I got more problems and sounds on my car after I spent $800 there. unbelievable!$LABEL$1
This place is looking to make money and rip you off.  The door of my car had a dent in it for over three years when I took it here for my annual inspection.  Never before did anywhere else have a problem with it$LABEL$1
I definitely got the best service of the restaurants on Ellsworth from this restaurant$LABEL$4
OK$LABEL$5
Lamb burger was outright bad(tasted off and charred). We shared and together only ate half. The filet was decent but not $25 worth of decent. Waiter was kind and the ambience is romantic but at the end of the day the food just wasn't that good. There are lots of great byo's in the city and in my opinion$LABEL$2
I've eaten here once after having it suggested by numerous people$LABEL$1
The adjectives that come to mind when I think of Cafe Zinho are cute$LABEL$4
Atmosphere and service was great. Appitizers were good. For dinner We ate the pork tenderloin and a ravioli of some sort.  Both tasted good with the pork tenderlion being the best.$LABEL$4
Visiting from NY$LABEL$5
I was underwhelmed with our dining experience. We are just learning Portuguese for an upcoming trip to Brazil and were excited about the option of using some of the vocab we had learned.Menu was somewhat limited$LABEL$2
This was the first time for me and my wife at the celebrated Cafe Zinho. Parking in the residential area in which the restaurant is located is next to impossible on a busy Saturday night; the diner should be prepared to walk a distance to get to the restaurant from where he or she is ultimately able to park.  The greatest drawback is that the restaurant is tiny and the seating so tight that at our table$LABEL$1
My partner and I were visiting my family in Pittsburgh we live in San Diego. my partner was born and raised in Portugal. My mom heard about this resaurant and was excited to take my partner and I to a Portuguese restaurant in Pittsburgh. We went$LABEL$1
This is a cozy little place. I made last minute reservations for a Saturday evening because the restaurant we were supposed to go to  closed due to an emergency. Major bummer for us$LABEL$4
What a gem of a place in Shadyside.  It s places like this that makes me miss living there.  Food was outstanding!  Because it was our first time$LABEL$5
Recently dined here for the first time and can say that I was pleased with all of the food choices we had made at this establishment. The cold prickly pear soup was certainly a good choice of appetizer. The service was acceptable and the staff very welcoming. The only downside to this place is the atmosphere. It can get extremely loud at times (especially when you are sitting next to a party of 12) and it becomes rather difficult to have any table conversation.$LABEL$3
Cafe Zinho is a cute little restaurant tucked away on a street corner in Shadyside that serves up Portuguese food. Everything looked great on the menu$LABEL$2
The grounds are very nice here$LABEL$4
The Frick Car and Carriage Museum is interesting and fun. They play very informative short films in a screening room and the docents there are very friendly$LABEL$3
I was here on Mother's Day with my Mom$LABEL$5
It's free$LABEL$3
Very nice home and grounds.  I could not exactly say I am a fan of the owner or how he earned his money but I did appreciate how original the house and belongings are and how beautiful the grounds and buildings are.   Can you say Johnstown flood?  How about the Homestead strike?  Celebrating the extreme wealth of few on the backs of a billion who worked 16 hour days for nothing isn't exactly something I really love to do but I can appreciate beautiful art and architecture of which there is plenty to see here.  We toured Clayton (the home)$LABEL$3
What a Frick-ing fantastic place!The Frick Art & Historical Center has all the bases covered when it comes to museums: historical site$LABEL$5
A delightful (and free?) way to spend the afternoon. The grounds are beautiful$LABEL$4
How have I been living in Pittsburgh for over a year without a visit to this awesome site?!  My husband and I finally paid a visit to the Frick thanks to the \""We Love Our Members\"" promotion that local museums were offering to their members.  (We are members at the Carnegie).  I was vaguely familiar with who Frick was and knew there was a house tour$LABEL$5
An often overlooked gem in the heart of Pittsburghs most beautiful neighborhood.The Frick is essentially 5 small sights in one. The grounds.  Nice 5 acre area that is well maintained giving a park like atmosphere.The greenhouse. Lovely little greenhouse you can walk through.The car museum is neat but currently closed for 18 months.  An early electric and steam car are the highlights.  Lots of olds rolls royces.The cafe. Food.The Clayton house.  12 dollar tour worth every penny.  The house tour takes about one hour and really is fascinating.  Not a huge mansion.All in all just a nice place.$LABEL$5
These people could not care less. I am still waiting for my washer dryer to get fixed -its been almost a month now and I am being told that they don't even know when the technician will return. The technician has been here 4 times already. Each time there is supposedly something else wrong and so they have to order another part. Miraculously the part is wrong (first week)$LABEL$1
so...my Maytag Neptune front-load washer...is malfunctioning...again! Evertime I try to wash a load of clothes...some of the water goes into the washer...then the rest of the water which is a lot...floods out of detergent dispenser and all over the exterior washer and onto my basement floor... tried to fix it my self but unsuccessful...fed up with the constant flooding...I called the Appliance Service Center like I usually do when my washer goes hay-wire... Customer service lady was okay...no awards for customer service excellence though...lol :) the appliance guy gave me a call...staying he will be at my home in 10 minutes which I thought was very considerate... the appliance guy...i call him...Mr. G... shows up and fixes the problem in 5 minutes! (to include the time it takes for introduction$LABEL$4
Okay.  Here's an update to my original experience.  I have to say that Emilio$LABEL$3
I am a jack of all trades and a do it yourself-er at heart. While in college I worked as a promotional photographer for my very dear friends salon. As a barter service she always did my hair for free! !0 years I had this deal going on. As you can imagine I was pretty spoiled and didn't want to start paying to get my hair did. I began coloring it myself. Now as a licensed skin care specialist you pick things up from the cosmetologists working with you.I killed it$LABEL$2
Sadly$LABEL$1
I recently had semi-permanent lashes put on for my wedding at the WEXFORD Izzazu salon. Upon completion$LABEL$2
I had an appointment that was made 2 months in advance and when I turned up they told me that the person I had the appointment with quit 6 weeks ago and they didn't have anyone available to take me. They made no attempt to reschedule me with someone else or call me to cancel. To make things worse$LABEL$1
Emailed and called several times to get a pricing on having several services done at once as a graduation present to myself. I was put on hold twice and never picked back up. Emails went unanswered.  :(I was going to have SO MUCH done$LABEL$1
A$LABEL$1
Unbelievable experience! Literally unbelievable. I waited 50 minutes and finally walked out. Receptionists were beyond awful. I booked 3 style appointments in advance for a wedding. One person was taken right away$LABEL$1
The best place for an artic swirl. :)$LABEL$5
Best place close to the city for a Dippy cone! I grew up in small town that hosted a Whippy Dip! Every time I see this type of privately run ice cream shop it reminds me of home and lazy summer days with my girlfriends. Riding bikes to the local pool$LABEL$4
This is one of many hidden gems here in the Burgh. Check it out$LABEL$4
I have lived in the area of Page's Dairy Mart for about 40 yrs. I have always enjoyed the ice cream until\"" this\"" day. I ordered an artic swirl (chocolate ice cream with chocolate chip cookie dough) I have ordered this same item over and over again. When I took first taste$LABEL$2
Hubby and I have taken to driving up Carson street to get to the Southside in order to avoid that HORRENDOUS traffic in Squirrel Hill.  We drove by Page Dairy Mart a few times and each time he would casually mention that he would like to go there someday.Well$LABEL$5
Stopped in here after a bit of night time sightseeing of Pittsburgh. My sister and brother-in-law$LABEL$5
Damn good ice cream.  I love a great generational dining experience$LABEL$4
Have driven by this establishment many times when I lived in Pittsburgh and in my visits$LABEL$4
Great ice-cream at a reasonable price. I love their chocolate banana milkshake.$LABEL$5
Get a Southside Shake with hot fudge shake and peanut butter sundae on top - absolutely amazing!$LABEL$5
The best soft serve I have ever had. Some flavors are better than others. Of the mint chocolate chip$LABEL$4
This place is a little gem! Hidden just down E Carson$LABEL$5
I have had lots of items off of their large menu and everything has been good.$LABEL$5
I've been coming to page's since I was about 5$LABEL$5
Page's is a Pittsburgh icon. The ice cream is good$LABEL$4
I have been driving by this little bakery for several years now and always wanting to stop in and try it.  Unfortunately$LABEL$3
Mmmmm. Their Egg drop soup is sooo good as is the General Tso's$LABEL$4
Horrible - they use chicken that's been out uncover all day . And they smoke around the food.:($LABEL$1
I gotta give my man Jonathan kudos for some recent changes he's implemented.  The upstairs now has a menu with smaller lighter items for the bar.  I can now finally go here and just grab an app' at the bar without having the customary food coma afterwards after his multicourse feast.  He's upgraded the staff and kept the pro's from the past (marney and errol).  Steve and Clint are good newer additions as server and bartender.  This is only my second 5 star review$LABEL$5
The food is unforgettable$LABEL$4
Some people train for marathons$LABEL$5
Always fantastic.$LABEL$5
The menu online gives no prices$LABEL$1
Incredible Italian food. Mushroom appetizer is just phenomenal. So is the mozzarella cheese. Great fish. Expensive but worth it!$LABEL$5
Might be the best restaurant I have been to in Pittsburgh! Made reservations on a Friday evening at 9:00PM for two.Apps: The service was great$LABEL$5
No better in taste than a Fazoli or even an Olive Garden.  Inflated prices$LABEL$1
Fabulous!$LABEL$5
good food$LABEL$5
I stopped by here this past Thursday with my fiance and 4 other dining companions for dinner.  Alla Famiglia has been on my list of places to try for quite a long time and I was eagerly anticipating eating a dinner here.  We arrived shortly before our reservation time of 7:30 at about the same time as another couple from our party. We were almost immediately taken back to our table which was on the first floor in a back room.  I honestly didn't notice too much while we were walking back to our table but thought there was not much decoration in the room we were in.  Yes there was a fireplace but nothing else really sticks out besides the fact that the lights would dim a bit for about 5 seconds before eventually brightening back up every 10 minutes or so.Since none of our party had ever been to Alla Famiglia before our server took the time to go over the menu with us.  Whenever he got to the veal chop and explained it was their specialty$LABEL$4
Seated in the bar after having made reservations a week in advance. That$LABEL$2
Words to the wise:1) Don't eat for approximately 3 days before having dinner here.  You'll thank me later.2) The bread and fixins (especially the bean and cheese gustoso)$LABEL$4
Incredibly authentic Italian cuisine. If your looking for a memorable spot with some of the most delicious actually Italian dishes then look no further than Alla Famiglia. This is a restaurant to celebrate an occasion at such as New Years$LABEL$5
My boyfriend & I went to Alla Famiglia for our (late) Valentine's Day dinner last night. We don't go out & splurge like this often$LABEL$2
Just recently returned. PHENOMENAL meal! Glenn our waiter was superb. Loved the veal dishes.  I also enjoyed the new cocktail menu. One of the drinks was iced coffee with orangicello and frangelica cream. DELICIOUS!$LABEL$5
The food was delicious. But it is a ridiculously expensive restaurant. If you're intimidated by spending $100 or more on a complete meal for 1 person$LABEL$3
The first time I went here was with a group - we had reserved the entire restaurant for a retirement party.   I had a horrible experience.  Vowed never to go back!  At that time$LABEL$1
UPDATED: Just wanted to share that we attempted to visit for a third time when my husband's brother was in town in mid-November of 2014.  We had reservations for 7:30 on a Tuesday$LABEL$5
Love it here. The food was great and had anazing service. Will be back again! Everyone was so poliet and greeted us with a smile.$LABEL$4
The name is ABC Garden and this is the best Chinese food I've had in Pittsburgh.  This place completely satisfies my Chinese food craving when I want that balance between fried deliciousness and fresh ingredients.  The neighborhood is kinda dodgy but since they deliver (and quick$LABEL$3
Well$LABEL$2
Never thought I would be reviewing a bank$LABEL$5
Our experience not so great.  We have mortgage as well as basic free checking and savings with Dollar in Squirrel Hill.  Mortgage application process was brutal.  Starting with the advertised rate of 2.85% being suddenly not available when we decided to lock it in; got 3.01%.  Automatic deduction of mortgage payment was required to secure this rate and it came out of the required Dollar checking account on the first business day of the month.  Free checking is free ... until.  Beware of Funds Availability policy.  We deposit a check monthly at the end of the month.  In August$LABEL$2
I was thrilled to finally find a yelp review with 4 stars and only one dollar sign on Yelp in the South Hills. Moving from LA recently where for some reason EVERYTHING is more expensive... except nail salons! Now$LABEL$2
If it wasn't for how fast and affordable the place is It would have no stars at all. I got a fill and a fix because I broke a nail. First off they didn't cut down my nails so now they are obnoxiously long. Second off they are so thin I feel like they are just going to crack off.  Not to mention it seems very dirty.. I was very uncomfortable the whole time I was there. One of the nail techs was constantly hitting on me. I will not be returning again.$LABEL$2
It's pretty average Chinese food. Their egg rolls and dumplings were decent enough as was the Hawaii Five O dish I had was ok too. The service is a little slow as well.$LABEL$3
Had Hunan Wok yesterday because it was on my way home. I've heard mixed reviews so I wanted to try it for myself. I tried to peruse the menu before ordering but I couldn't find it online anywhere which is disappointing because the hard copy they have available had at least 300 different options from apps$LABEL$3
I live closeby so I've been there dozens of times. I usually get chicken with broccoli or moo goo gai pan. My sister Vi usually gets moo shoo pork. The food is excellent American Chinese cuisine. The broccoli is always cooked perfectly$LABEL$3
Had chicken salad. Was good but very pricey. Their pizza is about 20-30% more expensive than any comparable pizza in the area. And since the pizza is just mediocre it is definitely not a good value so I'll pass!$LABEL$2
Yesterday I had the misfortune of getting a pizza from Bishops. It was my first time getting a pizza from there in a long time. Needless to say. I won't be getting one again. I got a pepperoni and sausage pizza. The pizza was bland$LABEL$1
The customer service is absolutely horrible. They made me wait an hour before anybody got to me$LABEL$1
Open 24hrs on Friday and Saturday how can you not love it. Total old school mom and pop diner. Wouldn't recommend anything other than breakfast. On top of everything else it cost nickels and dimes to eat here. After you've blown all your money at a bar in southside you'll still have enough to eat away some of your drunkness on the way home.$LABEL$4
My first trip here was on a Sunday at 4pm. I was surprised to see I was the only customer. We were met by friendly staff took our choice of seat and gazed at the menu. I wanted a verity so I picked the 2 pancakes$LABEL$2
I recently bought my first motorcycle (a 2001 KTM Duke II) and found Bohn's when searching online for KTM dealers. I went in with the intention of buying a jacket$LABEL$2
I'm in the market for a fun little scooter to have fun and commute on$LABEL$1
I usually love this place but it's gone bad. Went to one in wv the other day and it was good. I think different owners. My beef this one is the cheese. Very pour quality. Bread and sauce still good though.$LABEL$3
I am kind to all service workers! always! This place has the worst service I have ever seen. I do not expect four star treatment from fast food but this place is ridiculous. You better check your bag because they are going to forget something. Yesterday my husband went to get a quickie family fish dinner. He was told that no sorry we are out of hushpuppies and Pepsi. Okay thats fine but what can we have to replace the hushpuppies? He was told to go down the street there is a store. This is inside$LABEL$1
The service here can be hit-or-miss$LABEL$2
Someone please change the cooking oil!! With the construction on Rt. 51$LABEL$2
It has rebounded from when it closed in 08 and now does some veg stuff along with the bar food. I'd still much rather eat up the street at Max's though.That said the clientele is nice/colorful & im glad it's reopened.$LABEL$3
I love this place.  They'll all know your name after the second or third visit and people tend to be very welcoming and open without being too \""Cheers-y\""Food is above average for a bar$LABEL$4
This is one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh. They have  been getting a lot of bands to play. Especially font of the Wednesday night Blue Grass jam night. The hummus is great. The staff is exceptionally friendly and knows my name. They have a great beer selection too.$LABEL$5
I went to Park House after much internal deliberation. And after reading all the high reviews from fellow yelpers.   This bar is less than 5 minutes from where I live.  I stopped in on a Saturday night and was pleased with the music that was playing and also the fact that the bar was not overcrowded. The bar tender barely acknowledged me the whole night.  There wasn't any free peanuts or popcorn when I visited. Nor did they have the beer that I like on tap.  I did get a very tasty double chocolate stout$LABEL$3
Went my first time for Thursday karaoke and had a blast!  They serve mediterranean fare; at least half the menu is vegetarian/easily vegan.  There are at least 2 bike racks outside$LABEL$4
Really great place to go. There was bluegrass music playing when I went which was a pleasant surprise. It wasn't too loud$LABEL$5
This place is like none other! Bar$LABEL$4
Good beer$LABEL$3
I was here for the well-known bluegrass night on a Wednesday a couple weeks ago and had a pretty good time. A friend met up with me here and we were able to enjoy the live music close to the bar and actually meet a few of the locals. I enjoyed the crowd- it seemed to mostly consist of 20 and 30 somethings$LABEL$3
I had heard a lot about their food and decided to check it out one night after purchasing a Groupon. This review is strictly for the food. It was not good. The hummus was okay$LABEL$2
Unfortunately$LABEL$2
I had a totally mixed experience with Bernie's$LABEL$3
Up-charges most of their products that you can find on B&H for way less money. Sales person treated me like I was a very inexperienced. Not a bad place if you're in need of camera gear without a moments notice$LABEL$2
I developed my 120 film here the other day$LABEL$1
Went in to buy a cold shoe adapter in a pinch on my way to a shoot. He charged me $20 for the same exact item that sells for $6.29 at B&H. I bought it without thinking$LABEL$1
Just stopped in to see about selling my Canon Rebel T3 to buy a 60D (that they don't have in stock because it's \""old\""). I was offered $50 for my T3$LABEL$1
Crap!  I can't believe that I missed a \""First to Review\"" by just a matter of weeks.  Max's Allegheny Tavern has been a shining star and a \""must\"" for my Pittsburgh rotation of places to visit.  Years ago$LABEL$5
Despite living in PIttsburgh for most of my life$LABEL$1
I like this restaurant so much I had my wedding rehearsal dinner here.  (Both the families liked the food very much.)  Max's is the best German food in Pittsburgh -- actually$LABEL$5
Real german food (sausage$LABEL$4
I must of been eating at another Max's in a pararell universe!Food was terriable$LABEL$1
Definitely my favorite German restaurant$LABEL$5
Visiting from San Francisco. Food was mediocre at best. Bland is the best description.  Sausages and  Weiner Schmitzel were unremarkable. Best was the sweet & sour cabbage that accompanied. But also served were over-boiled 'daily vegetable' of snap peas$LABEL$2
Not only does this place have a very nice atmosphere$LABEL$5
Great atmosphere of a neighborhood pub$LABEL$2
After a long day at work I met up with a friend for some German fair on the northside. I don't get out to this neck of the woods that often so it was a treat for me! All appetizers are  $2.99 during happy hour so we went with the Potato pockets which were perogies in my book. They were crispy and creamy$LABEL$3
I really like this Northside institution.  They serve the beer in jars and I had Spaten German beer- very good.  They put really buttery free popcorn on the table so be careful- the grease sticks to your fingers.  In the bar they have an old fashioned player piano.  I really like the German fare- big portions. The schitzel is good but not great but overall way better than Hofbrauhaus and not Disney- it's the real McCoy.$LABEL$4
A Pittsburgh tradition.  Try the Cheese stuffed pretzel appetizer$LABEL$5
I've been going to Max's off and on for 31 years (I KNOW!  How could someone as young as I am been going there for THAT long?)    And I am not from nor ever lived in the North Side!That said...i have always loved the food and the place.   I was great the first time and was great last night!   Most of the mains can be recommended without reservation....last night I had roasted pork with dressing and gravy.  It was deliscious!    As for sides....I ALWAYS have potato pancakes and sweet and sour cabbage.  (Because of my eastern european background I am partial to both cabbage and potatoes.   Do not be afraid of the cabbage unless you dislike sour! We didn't have dessert$LABEL$4
The goulash was (sickeningly) sweet and the bread pudding wasn't sweet at all.  But the atmosphere is kind of cool.  And the prices are downright cheap.$LABEL$3
Let me preface this by saying that my understanding of goulash came from what my mom called goulash.  Goulash in the Contrucci household was made of elbow noodles$LABEL$2
I have been going to Max's for 20 years.  I love this place.  The Einlauf soup is just simple good eats$LABEL$5
This is my favorite restaurant on the Northside$LABEL$5
Excellent German food.  I went in for an early lunch$LABEL$5
I honestly can't get enough of this place.  We used to come here after going to Pirates games since its right up the road.  Now its one of my favorite places to go out with my friends.Its a bit pricey (~$15/person)$LABEL$5
I really thought I'd never be back.  The goulash I had was so so gross.  But then$LABEL$3
Our dinner here was a nice experience.  We were going to a concert and when we arrived many people were waiting to be seated.  We were told to expect a half hour wait.  We sat at the bar and had a drink and in what must have been only ten minutes we were asked if we would mind eating at a booth in the bar area rather than wait for the dinning room.  We were thrilled$LABEL$3
been here a number of times and it's my favorite German food in Pgh!$LABEL$4
What to eat for dinner? Hmmm$LABEL$4
The food isn't as good as it once was.  The atmosphere is kind of dark and needs to be updated.  We ordered potato pancakes that had to be returned because they somehow tasted fishy (I don't even want to speculate).  The other items we ordered were ok. Staff is great$LABEL$3
Not sure why my review was flagged but I can assure that I$LABEL$2
My husband and I have been to this restaurant many times over the past 20 years and went for sandwiches tonight. Sorry to say it was the worst food we have ever eaten at this place. Reuben sandwich was greasy and had little meat. Sweet potato fries were not edible. We ate at a table at the bar and told Andy our bartender but got zero satisfaction. Since we've had such a bad experience and no effort by the restaurant to remedy a BAD MEAL$LABEL$1
I work on the North Shore and have heard many coworkers rave about Max's.  When I finally tried it$LABEL$5
This is americanized German food.  For real German food$LABEL$3
I've been here once because this was an easy place to meet for dinner with a friend. I enjoyed eating here well enough.I'm honestly not a die-hard fan of German food$LABEL$3
I went to Max's for the first time with my family a few weeks ago. I ordered the kielbasa sandwich with a side of kase spaetzle. The kielbasa on the sandwich was topped with a serving of sauerkraut and served on a toasted roll.  It was your average kielbasa sandwich. Satisfying$LABEL$3
First I'll start off with the homemade beer.  Nothing spectacular$LABEL$4
I have stopped going to Max's for regular meals because the food isn't so good but a friend likes to go for Sunday brunch.I find a good portion of the food is acceptable for the brunch$LABEL$2
Brunch$LABEL$3
This is one of the only German restaurants I know of in the area. The meal was good and reasonably priced. They also have a good beer selection on draft and in bottles. We had a party of 6 going for a 7:30 dinner on a Thursday. Bigger parties tend to chat a little more and take longer in my experience. I felt like they were sort of rushing us out. That might be because they closed the dining room door and started vacuuming the front bar room while we were still finishing up our dinner. I'm not sure if anyone was eating out there but I'm very happy we weren't because it seems really gross to me to vacuum around food. This was around 9:15 and I'm pretty sure they serve until 10. Besides that$LABEL$3
I ordered the Roast Pork loin with Apple raisin dressing$LABEL$4
I really like this place. It has a neat atmosphere where the entrance has a nice bar and then there are a few other rooms that have the feeling of a living room or dining room. I really enjoy their brunches$LABEL$4
Tremendous selection of German dishes.  All the sausages come from a particular manufacturer in Wisconsin that uses 100 year old methods of making them (according to the menu).  I don't know if that's a good thing or not$LABEL$5
Max's is great. It feels like your German grandmothers house and the service matches this feeling. The food is authentic and inexpensive. If you are not too familiar with German food$LABEL$5
This used to be the best German food in town. I have seen a gradual decline in the food over the past several years. The gravies have changed and the Max's Goulash (one of my favorite dishes) has a different sauce (strangely dessert sweet) and change in the protein. The sides are still great$LABEL$2
Max's was good$LABEL$2
Man$LABEL$5
This place is awesome.  Authentic$LABEL$4
Our first stop in Pittsburgh$LABEL$4
I cannot believe Max's is going from 5 stars to 2 stars for me.You have to understand$LABEL$2
I love this place.  The atmosphere$LABEL$5
The old arcade game was excellent and only a few quarters to play.Drinks nice enough .Bartenders were really nice. NIce enough place.$LABEL$3
Got take out from this place on the weekend.  Ordered kung pao chicken$LABEL$3
I work on the North Side and went for a walk to find something new for lunch.  I am quickly growing tired of Eco Bistro directly downstairs from my office at Allegheny Center.At any rate$LABEL$3
I somehow discovered this place when searching for sandwich places to enjoy with a friend.  How I have never noticed it when walking by it on East Ohio Street$LABEL$5
You really need to try's this place. Great sandwiches$LABEL$5
I really wanted to like this place. Great reviews and a renovated priory--what a great idea! The pictures on the website are beautiful.We found a grumpy old man at the front desk$LABEL$1
My wife and I stayed at The Priory when we went out to Pittsburgh for Superbowl weekend. The hotel is beautiful inside and out. We don't normally stay in nice hotels$LABEL$4
We stayed here and was initially disappointed-- being new to town$LABEL$1
We've stayed here twice during recent trips to Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
Great european style boutique hotel.  You can not beat this hotel for the money!$LABEL$5
Was at a beautiful wedding.  Staff was terrible$LABEL$1
I was very specific when I made my reservations several months ago. I needed a non-entrance level room away from noise. We were given a room right off of the hotel Foyer. It is mid-night and a party rages just outside my door even though I have called the front desk asking for their assistance. Right now I would prefer to be in a Motel6.  This room was relatively not cheap$LABEL$2
Ended up here since for some reason all the major hotels on the North Side were booked.  Overall this is a solid option if that happens to you$LABEL$3
booked through a third party site and they tried to stick us in a queen room even though they had plenty of kings available. definitely gave attitude about it but \""upgraded\"" anyway. he wanted to charge me the difference but I refused. just bad service overall. no one to help with bags morning or night. even the day front desk person was short with us and rude. I couldn't wait to get out of there. the room was clean and charming. the area is definitely rough. I wouldn't stay here again.$LABEL$2
We decided to have a little staycation at the Priory earlier this month.  My husband made the reservation with a special they were having for a dinner date night.  With the special$LABEL$1
After considerable research for a hotel on the night of a Steelers football game (a Sunday night against the Baltimore Ravens$LABEL$4
So apparently I have this habit$LABEL$3
My review is limited to the restroom.  I was in town for a Steelers/Jets game and the portable toilet line was very long.  So I walked over here and for $5 the allowed me to use the restroom for the rest of the day (they stamped my hand).  I was told that it would be donated to a charity (I believe he said ALS).  Great idea if it is true.  The restroom is not very large (men's room had 2 urinals and 2 toilets) but it is much better than the options out in the parking lot.  As far as the rest of the place$LABEL$3
First I would like to say the Pasta Too of old had good food$LABEL$2
Awesome fast pizza$LABEL$5
We didn't order directly from them$LABEL$3
Breadworks has great bread although I usually only buy it in the summer because I make my own bread. I am rating it 4 stars and not 5 for one thing$LABEL$4
I was fortunate enough to enjoy a Saturday night Oktoberfest celebration here this past weekend. A friend of mine is a member of this private German heritage club$LABEL$5
Okay$LABEL$3
If this place wasn't up on a hill$LABEL$3
I really don't know how this place got any good reviews. One big problem is that the place is dirty$LABEL$1
This place was a total surprise to me. I didn't really know anything existed on Troy Hill aside from Penn Brewery until I went for a ride through the area this past weekend. While passing through I noticed Billy's$LABEL$3
Good neighborhood bar/restaurant. Always good food. Never got sick$LABEL$5
How to put this gently?While I may go back to Pittsburgh some day$LABEL$1
I visited both the art and natural history museums last weekend. I majorly bummed that the large dinosaur exhibit was under refurbishment. Most of the rest of the museum is a large taxidermy exhibit - not my thing.In addition$LABEL$3
Why Go?You want to see lots of shiny gems$LABEL$3
The boy and I spent most of a day here.  In the morning$LABEL$4
There are actually 4 museums in the Carnegie Museum group in Pittsburgh. I'll review the Natural History and Art Museums in this review (separate review for the Warhol forthcoming.)The low-down - for $15 you get admission to both the Natural History Museum and the Art Museum. It is well worth the money as you can spend hours on both sides.The Natural History Museum is a dinosaur lover heaven. The fossils are seriously awesome$LABEL$5
I'm from Detroit. We have a decent art museum$LABEL$4
Totally incredible way to spend an afternoon with my family - these museums have it all! Since we have a family membership (which I highly recommend)$LABEL$5
The staff were incredible and very helpful.Dinosaurs!Gicometti!Carnegie International 2013 was trip! And to see CI from previous years...it was like a hot party that all the great ones are invited to!$LABEL$4
In response to the response I received from the Museum rep$LABEL$1
It's the first time I've \""Yelped\"" anything other than a restaurant. However$LABEL$5
Estimated delivery time 45 minutes actually delivery time 120 minutes.Pizza Hut$LABEL$1
Decided to hit this place before hitting on 12 while the dealer shows a 9 at the Rivers.   We didn't have a reservation but the server seated us anyways (we had to be done by 7).  It is BYOB but they deal you a $4 corkage fee per person drinking.  The bread sticks were fresh and warm and were the perfect accompaniment to the delicious soup du jour$LABEL$5
Food: menu will appeal to vegetarians and non-vegetarians$LABEL$3
So....what do you say when a highly rated place let's you down??  It was okay....When a meal rocks my world$LABEL$3
Small$LABEL$2
This is our favorite restaurant$LABEL$5
We made reservations for my mother's birthday for 14. No one in my family had ever been to the restaurant; we used yelp and trip advisor to find it.  They were ready for us and everything was fabulous.  I had spaghetti and meatball.  The pasta was perfectly done. The kitchen was great.  Everyone got their meals almost at the same time (which is very hard for a small restaurant with a big group).  The people were professional and friendly.  The BYOB allowed us to have wine that suited everyone's taste.  They did the pasta and non-pasta dishes very well.  This small restaurant is a gem in an up and coming neighborhood.  We walked from the Priory Hotel on a beautiful March evening.$LABEL$5
Service is friendly and quick! Everything comes at a timely manner and all the food is fairly priced. Although it's a little small$LABEL$5
I have been here several times and always have a great experience! The food is always delicious$LABEL$5
Legends...interesting name. With a name like Legends$LABEL$4
This is a really small restaurant and is BYOB. The servers are friendly and the food was good. I ordered two appetizers (small plates) which were very good - greens and beans and then muscles. The flavours were both good$LABEL$3
OK$LABEL$2
This restaurant is a gem. Wanted to check out another neighborhood in Pittsburgh. To an ignorant outsider$LABEL$4
Legends is good...but not special. It's just your typical Italian-American restaurant$LABEL$3
I've eat'n here a few times over the last couple of years and have been very pleased with both the food and service every time.  I most recently was there on this past Saturday$LABEL$5
I ate here this past Friday evening with my girlfriend and two other dining companions.  I had made 7 PM reservations for us and we arrived shortly before that to a table that was ready for us.  The inside of the restaurant is actually much tinier than I had expected with as many people crammed in as possible.  It probably was helped that the night we were there$LABEL$5
Legends of the North Shore on the top 25 restaurants in Pittsburgh list? I would have to disagree. I joined a three dining companions for dinner on a recent Friday night. When I walked in$LABEL$3
Stopped by for lunch and was greeted by great-looking focaccia coming out of the oven. Based on that view$LABEL$3
After reading some peoples reviews I wasn't sure of this place. My boyfriend and I decided to go anyways. All I can say is$LABEL$5
Rated one of Pittsburgh's best in 2012 I was excited to enter Legends and prepare for  what was sure to be an amazing meal. Upon entering Legends$LABEL$3
If I could give this restaurant a zero$LABEL$1
Caruso's is the best place to buy beer (and pop and snacks and smokes) on the northside by far. Hidden in its original spot in the Mexican War Streets$LABEL$5
The best thing about this place is Sam. The worst thing about this place is also Sam.What was great was that Sam made me feel at home and treated me like someone he had known for a long time. He took me to the back of his warehouse$LABEL$1
Awful.  I didn't know how bad it was until I went to a different GE and saw how good it could be.  The lines are long$LABEL$1
Scariest/shadiest grocery store experience in my life. Hubby and I pulled in only to see a few cars down$LABEL$1
The store reeks of rotting fish$LABEL$1
Awful.  Worst grocery store I've ever been to.  To make it worse$LABEL$1
The store has a weird rotting meat smell sometimes. The selection isn't amazing but there are a few interesting items here. As other people commented there are always people hanging around outside.... But they are friendly at least to me! One thing I like about the store is the proximity to my house. The biggest let down is the sky high prices that I think GE is notorious for... I miss Kroger$LABEL$1
Zero stars? Really terrible store. High prices$LABEL$1
It's close to my neighborhood$LABEL$2
So I got a call from Giant Eagle asking me to give my opinion of this store. My recommendation was to burn this place to the ground. Buckle up for crappy produce$LABEL$1
This Giant Eagle is one of the few that only use the Giant Eagle name$LABEL$2
OK-- I need to stick up for this store after reading these other reviews.  I live nearby and have shopped here multiple times a week for the past year or so.  I find this store to be consistently clean and the employees to be helpful$LABEL$3
It wasn't as horrid as the reviews would lead you to think. Just don't expect a gleaming suburban-style mega-mart and you will be fine.$LABEL$3
I hate to agree with the other poor reviews of this branch$LABEL$2
I've had a lot of bad experiences at this store. The employees have been rude so much that I just expect them to roll there eyes when I get deli meat. Lines are long$LABEL$2
Why all the hate for this Giant Eagle? Sure it's not in the ritzy part of town but they have everything all the other Giant Eagles have. I've never gone here and not found what I needed. Don't be scared of people just because they are different than you. This Giant Eagle gets the job done and is fine by me! BTW the charmingly ghetto picture is hilarious and we'll fitting! Bravo!$LABEL$3
The problem with this dry cleaner is poor counter service.  I have never been treated in such a poor manner - and the sad part is that this SERVICE provider doesn't care.  I recommend going elsewhere.  They are not worth my money.$LABEL$1
I went here on a Saturday night with a few friends.  They had  a DJ so there was a cover of $3 - boo!  I'm really adverse to covers unless there's something really great going on and considering I had never been in this place before$LABEL$2
Get me some Peanutzz!! We decided on a whim to try something different for a bar and this place indeed was. Saturdays there is a cover for the DJ which was $3. This didn't seem so bad to me after coming from other cities where the covers are $15 and $20 and higher but I feel like the place could use the money. Peanutz is a small venue. The bar area is narrow and cramped then to the left of it there is a dark area where the DJ is along with some tables and then the stairs to the bathroom. If you weren't at the bar then people were just sitting at the tables starring at the DJ or at you... Maybe one or two people were dancing to the music. I thought the music was awesome though - a mix of old school and underground hip hop. Beers were so cheap - I think we paid $5 for three draft beers. Woot!! However some folks were smoking and the bathrooms were gross. My jacket took a few days to air out the smell of the smoke. I won't be returning even if Peanutz offered some peanuts.$LABEL$2
I am a pretty easygoing guy. I would've overlooked the fact(s) that:1. Jim Beam is your only bourbon. 2. For some reason two drinks came out to $9.90.* 3. Even with only 10 people in the bar$LABEL$2
To start$LABEL$2
Our bartender didn't know what a pint was or how to pour a beer$LABEL$1
I haven't been a member of the Allegheny YMCA for very long$LABEL$5
I'm still giving this Y five stars because I like the other patrons and the atmosphere so much; I just want to re-evaluate the place now that I've gotten way better at various activities.The cardio room is still really$LABEL$5
Four stars - not because the facility itself is stellar$LABEL$4
Awesome spot to grab a dog for a buck. Nothing fancy$LABEL$5
Best place in the city to get a dog$LABEL$4
Classic North Side staple.  The food is made to order$LABEL$5
I really wasn't thrilled with our meal here. The service was fine$LABEL$2
STAY AWAY...We've been 3 times over the past few years$LABEL$1
I have been to Atria locations around the city - but this was my first time at the Atria's location at PNC Park on the North Shore of Pittsburgh. My young professional group had an event there last night$LABEL$3
The food is good and the portions are large.  The service is terrible.  The servers are just \""too cool$LABEL$2
I love coming to PNC Park in the Summer. If i get here early enough i stop by atria's and have a scotch$LABEL$3
I feel bad about giving this place such a meh review but every time I go that's exactly how I feel when I leave. Atria's is one of those places that I've never had any type of memorable service experience or food experience for that matter.I can't say the food is bad$LABEL$2
My husband and I are Cubs fans and flew into Pittsburgh to see Friday and Saturday's Cubs-Pirates game this past weekend (7/7 & 8).  We got to PNC Park around 5 p.m. and since the gates weren't open we decided to sit and have some drinks before the game.  We stopped first at Atria's.  Although there was only one other table occupied outside$LABEL$1
Ugh$LABEL$1
The food is acceptable. They have a pretty wide range$LABEL$2
I wasn't expecting 4 star service. We walked in and had to wait 5 minutes before one of the servers noticed us since the hostess wasn't at her post. He took us to the banquet room and seated us at the last table in the front. The tables had plastic table cloths that have seen better days ours had holes in it and still had some caked on super stain sauce in one area. Then we waited 20 minutes before our waitress came to greet us. She took our drink order and our dinner order. (pretty simple since it was a prix fix menu with only choices for soup or salad and a choice of ham or turkey and either Apple or Pumpkin Pie). She brought the drinks right away. Then 10 minutes for the salad/soup -- very tasty$LABEL$2
As your standard restaurant$LABEL$2
I think the low marks for this place are unwarranted. Quality of food at this location is every bit as good as the other Atria's around town. Pot roast nachos are out of this world!$LABEL$4
Having lived near this Atria's location in the past$LABEL$3
Atria's is a pretty good restaurant if you're at or near PNC Park - as expected from anything located in a ballpark it's not the best restaurant ever but it's consistently decent.  On different visits I have tried the Margherita Flatbread and Cheese Dip which were both fine (although the fried pita chips were really salty) as well as the Diablo pasta which was okay and the Pork Filet Gorgonzola which was quite good.  In an ideal world I would walk over the bridge and eat at a more unique restaurant downtown but when I have to choose from something nearby Atria's is one of the better choices.  A number of my colleagues prefer this as their go-to restaurant and while I'm not quite as enamored as them I definitely consider this an A-OK restaurant and I'll be back.$LABEL$3
Located right next to PNC Park$LABEL$2
I was neither particularly pleased nor dissatisfied with my lunch experience here... It was just \""meh.\"" It's kinda pricey for what you get$LABEL$3
I came here with a party of 40 very hungry Pitt students. The food was amazing. We had roasted beef$LABEL$5
Here before Bucs VICTORY OVER THE CARDS in game 3 of the NLDS$LABEL$1
Came in late night during Light the Night$LABEL$2
ok$LABEL$1
I came here on the Fourth of July after getting off of work. My friend and I stopped for one drink before the fireworks. Let's just say I will never return. I stood there for a good 15 minutes with maybe 5 people tops at the bar. The bartenders never once acknowledged me yet they did manage to make eye contact. They then all walked out from behind the bar and went outside. It took another ten minutes until finally the manager came over and served me. I am a bartender and I am appalled to see such people being employed at what seems like a decent place. I am a phenomenal tipper being that I am in the industry and sadly I didn't leave a single dollar. Hopefully they can learn from their mistakes instead of probably losing more potential customers.  What a shame.$LABEL$1
Average experience. The entrees that we chose (chicken marsala and chicken piccata) were fine but under seasoned. The cheese plate was the best part of the meal: four cheeses selected and served by Carole \""dear heart\"" from Penn Mac. Exceptional choices$LABEL$3
After eating lunch several days a week at Atrias PNC Park restaurant for many years$LABEL$1
I decided to check out downtown Pittsburgh on my trip for a family visit recently. We took a walk around the area and this location caught our eye. It had outdoor seating and was right outside of PNC Park. We decided on the Pot Roast nachos as an appetizer. It was pretty good. Nice chunks of Pot Roast and various cheeses. I than decided on the Atria combo which had andouille sausage$LABEL$3
I was here on a business dinner and it firmly seated itself as the absolute WORST place I've ever eaten at. -hair in the food-crab cakes were touted as amazing$LABEL$1
Absolutely the best!!!  Not from Pittsburgh.  Was there on vacation with my kids.  They absolutely LOVED IT.  Even my youngest$LABEL$5
Oh my God. They're playing the chicken dance song on their website! Bahaha!So what is so great about this place? Mister Rogers of course! For those not in the know$LABEL$5
Why would I be writing a review of a Children's museum when I don't have any children?!  Because it's an awesome museum$LABEL$5
This place is amazing from top to bottom. 2 hours down we are still here.$LABEL$5
Good times for kiddies of all ages and grown up too. I especially love the art studio on the first floor$LABEL$4
This place is a blast for kids of all ages! All floors are packed full of great fun for kids$LABEL$5
I moved from Columbus$LABEL$5
I love this museum! I've gone several times with friends and their children. There are so many fun things for kids to go$LABEL$5
Can't get an order right! 6 of the last 8 times we ordered they have messed it up.   I know$LABEL$2
was in the neighborhood on a girls weekend. this place is fantastic.  great prices$LABEL$5
Okay hold the phone$LABEL$3
I lived off of pickles in college!  The only downfall was their delivery time.  It always took almost an hour and a half to receive my food$LABEL$2
I tried Pickles tonight for the first time.  I called ahead to order a gyro calzone and was told 20 minutes.  I got there and was told it would be another 10.   It was another 20 before I got my food.  In a bad frame of mind$LABEL$2
I've enjoyed the pizza$LABEL$4
Went there for lunch today. Needing some food other than hospital food. Short walk to it from Allegheny General. Thought about ordering lunch special$LABEL$3
Don't do it! The ribs are average at best. The sides are just as average as well. The bones are small and barely have any meat on them at all. The greens were decent and the macaroni salad was awful with tons of water in it. This place is almost as bad as the now closed Mr Willie's BBQ in Squirrel Hill! I had such high hopes for this place. Oh well. That's what I get for trying to cheat on Showcase BBQ in Homewood. Now those are the best ribs in Pittsburgh and some of the best in the country! They don't take debit or credit cards. Cash Only!$LABEL$2
The ribs were great with mild sauce.  The chicken with hot sauce was ok.  Hot sauce was nice and hot$LABEL$3
We love the ribs here.  Watch out$LABEL$4
Steel Pride$LABEL$5
As I sit in my living room$LABEL$5
The Steelers are the coolest team in football. They have the best colors$LABEL$5
5 time Super Bowl champs.$LABEL$5
Being born in 1970 was about perfect. Pittsburgh was becoming the City of Champions. The Steelers will always be my favorite team. I even have the logo on my neck$LABEL$5
I didn't even like football before I moved to Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
A ring for each finger and a sixth for my... other hand!  You're dirty!Go Steelers!!!$LABEL$5
Steelers$LABEL$5
I wanted to choose something special for my 100th review.  It has to be something near and dear to my heart...I choose to rate my most favorite professional sports team$LABEL$5
1 star for your cover-2 defense that lost me $100 on the Super Bowl.  I thought yall were going to shut down Fitzgerald.  You disappointed me.  Wouldn't have mattered if that Big Ben TD didn't get called back and turned into a field goal$LABEL$1
Not much you say about the Steelers that the sports world doesn't already know. The Steelers are the model for what all Professional Football teams strive to be. From the ownership$LABEL$4
She's dressed in black and yellow$LABEL$5
I have been a Steelers fan as long as I can remember. I love the Steelers as a sports team$LABEL$2
Perfect experience for this Steelers fan from Maryland. Had the walk up tour$LABEL$5
Seattle may have just won the 2014 Super Bowl$LABEL$5
Yay for Steelers! It's awesome that Mike Tomlin looks like Omar Epps. Also Pittsburgh food is awesome. Pierogi$LABEL$5
My friend lives near here so I came to satisfy my deli sandwich craving. The inside is super dingy deli/convenience store$LABEL$2
My goodness$LABEL$3
Out of business.$LABEL$1
It's cathartic to give this sorry organization 1 star.Note: this is a review of the baseball club$LABEL$1
The current era which is now on a 17 seasons under .500 streak is just horrid and deserves one star at best. The '71 through '79 and the early '90s eras get 5 stars for having such cool players as Roberto Clemente$LABEL$3
O my Pittsburgh Pirates.  What a storied history you have!  But the last time you went to the post season was in 1992$LABEL$2
Hats off to the 2011 version of the Pittsburgh Pirates! for the most part$LABEL$4
A cautious 3.5 stars here but....S-W-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-E-P!The Bucs swept the Royals in interleague play this past weekend!  And okay$LABEL$3
I love the buccos$LABEL$4
Ugh!  Another losing season.  WTF man$LABEL$1
Go Pirates!!! That's all I can say. They've made me love baseball and Pittsburgh again. They're only going to get better.$LABEL$5
I've lived in Pittsburgh for 20 years and JUST discovered St. Anthony's Chapel.   A friend of mine was visiting from NYC and$LABEL$4
My wife and I have visited St. Anthony's Chapel three time so far and every time the experience is a moving one.  I would recommend the guided tour.  The amount of relics contained in the chapel is amazing.  If you a person of faith this is a wonderful place.$LABEL$5
I was raised Catholic (but no longer practice)$LABEL$1
I wouldn't pay attention to the Trib's news coverage$LABEL$2
So$LABEL$1
Although I've never had any of their other menu items except their gyro$LABEL$2
This is a gem in Pittsburgh.  The owner$LABEL$5
\""grossest hostess\""Okay$LABEL$2
I have eaten here twice. Both times I thought the food was sub-par. The first time was a birthday lunch that was lousy$LABEL$2
Okay so I tried this place twice before writing a review to give them a fair shot. Unfortunately$LABEL$2
I've been there twice$LABEL$2
I don't really mind dive places because there are times that they have really good food.  The place is dated and could use updating.The waitress was good.  I think she knew we weren't all that pleased with our food even though we told her it was good.The food....my daughter-in-law had the shrimp scampi.  We are pros at making our own at home$LABEL$2
I've been going to Miller's since I was just a little tyke.  Unfortunately$LABEL$3
I worked at millers back in the nineties. The fish was fresh every day from wholeys$LABEL$2
Ordered a lg pizza for pick up$LABEL$1
Terrible. I lived about 2 blocks away - and with no other options - I still can't bring myself to order from here. Ordered twice in the last 90 days and both times it was terrible. Ended up waiting over an hour each time. First time I got home to find a totally different order; the send time waited over 1.5 hrs for a pizza. Both were crappy$LABEL$1
We just moved in a couple blocks away and thought we'd try them out. Their prices are great but$LABEL$2
Too much cheese on their pizzas$LABEL$2
Review #200I got hooked on this bakery while living in Brighton Heights.  Now$LABEL$4
My dog means the world to me and I couldn't imagine anyone better to handle her care than Dr. Dorn. I grew up raising puppies as a family hobby and became very attached to quality care from a vet in my hometown. My standards for a vet are high and I was more than pleasantly surprised by WLAH. My first experience with Dr. Dorn was no more than 2 weeks after my adoption of my dog. I was pretty certain that she had UTI and it was confirmed. He was such a nice doctor and all of his staff was understandable and sweet. It also felt like a family environment and the office building is adorable. I didn't feel like I was taking my dog to some overly commercial MedVet (the worst place you can go) or chain. The whole appointment$LABEL$5
I'm underwhelmed. Being a Mike & Tonys kind of girl$LABEL$3
This place has THE WORST customer relations I've experienced in Pittsburgh since I moved here two months ago. My boyfriend was about to order a gyro$LABEL$1
Honestly$LABEL$4
Hummus is very good. Not a place you'd want to \""go out\"" for dinner but great for a quick bite to eat. Would go there again.$LABEL$3
Very disappointed. Delivery was late$LABEL$1
Awful poor excuse for a gyro. Food is always soggy. Meat is pure horsec*ck. Very unfriendly staff$LABEL$1
It's a used media store chain. Not to much to say about it. I usually shy away from these places because they run the independent stores out of business. I still stand by that but I gotta say that no matter which one of these I walk into$LABEL$3
I think I might open a store$LABEL$3
Standard Pittsburgh dive. They had Yuengling$LABEL$3
It's a bar that you can smoke in... what more do you want?  If you need to feel pretentious while you are out$LABEL$3
The Apple Inn is what it is.And that is a bar in Dormont that you could go to any day of the week and have a good time among friends$LABEL$4
The apple is decent if you live within walking distance but nothing to write home about.  Average draft selection.  Didn't get into bottles but found that the bartender that happened to be working was not overly friendly.  Went for a happy hour and it was dead.  Haven't been to the Apple in years but seems like a good place to meet friends and play darts all night.  Smoker friendly.  I couldn't tell the crowd that frequents it because it was so dead.$LABEL$3
Pretty good place to grab a few drink. Extremely expensive for the area however. I also don't understand their happy hour$LABEL$3
This place is terrible and the management has acted like an entitled prick every time I was there lol... Id rather get shot at R Bar$LABEL$1
I love this store. They have a little bit of everything$LABEL$4
I have to say$LABEL$4
For six years now I have been threatening to purchase a salt lamp for my bedside table. The early spring and late summer when I'm using allergy medication like a fish uses water$LABEL$3
I recently had my 21 birthday and booked Entertainment Unlimited to DJ at my party. I had talked to him we worked out types of music and a playlist that would best fit my party and it's theme. He got there on time and was set up before my party guests showed up. It was the best party I've ever had$LABEL$3
Great small grocer!Giant Eagle offers a lot of things$LABEL$5
Kuhn's seems like they pride themselves on being a \""Family\"" themed grocery store.I've been to Kuhn's quite a few times$LABEL$3
Thank God for Kuhn's. Seriously$LABEL$4
So I have to ask myself$LABEL$4
Kuhn's is really the only convenient grocery for where we live and they do have a great selection of higher end lunch meats$LABEL$2
I haven't been to Kuhn's in months and forgot how much I prefer it over the other grocery stores in the area.  Once you get past the craziness in the parking lot it's not so bad.  It's smaller than the other grocery stores around but still have ample choices of all your produce/meat/dairy/deli needs fo sho.  Their prices are less expensive than GE too!  If only they had fuel perks...  The service is always fast and friendly.  I'll be doing the rest of my thanksgiving shopping there.  They have some good deals going on right now.  .99lb Honeysuckle turkeys no min purchase!$LABEL$4
Had a friend who went here. REALLY BAD experience$LABEL$1
A-OK barber shop.  Typical old school shop with 3 chairs.  My kids and I go here and they do good job including shaving the neck.  Depending on the clientele$LABEL$3
Best shop by far in the South Hills.  Purchased a Cannondale 29er there$LABEL$5
Good coffee$LABEL$4
Nice neighborhood coffee.  Small but always seems to have room.  Good selection of teas also..  Good scones and pastries.  CT dos have some specialty blends.$LABEL$3
Coffee and atmosphere are great... but my God$LABEL$1
I bought a latte.....no wait! Actually$LABEL$1
First$LABEL$4
I can't believe this place has not been reviewed yet.  If you live in beechview you already know about this place$LABEL$3
I like the double cooked wings$LABEL$2
... Look... I hate writing a less than stellar review of a business. It actually makes my cold goth baby heart sad. No one WANTS to go somewhere and get bad service$LABEL$2
Good food. Reasonable pricing. Wings and rings were my fair my most recent stop hereMy friend had a steak which looked and smelled delicious. She confirmed that it was.$LABEL$4
Always leaving incredibly happy$LABEL$5
Because I am the cheapskatiest of cheapskates$LABEL$5
Sushi Three is located in a strip of shops on Beverly Road$LABEL$3
I just got lunch from here today.  For $9.63$LABEL$4
Sushi selection limited...  Miso soup tasted a little fishy.$LABEL$3
sushi was dry and unenjoyable. the place itself is clean and the decor was minimal.  I was not a fan and probably won't be back.$LABEL$2
Just moved to the area$LABEL$4
This was my second visit and alas$LABEL$1
I am a huge fan of Sushi Three. They live within walking distance of my home$LABEL$5
I go there as a tradition with my best friend when she comes home and it's one of my favorite places. The resteraunt is quiet and low lit so it's very relaxing. Service is quick and friendly. The lunch specials are amazing deals and there's enough variety there that I never get bored with the choices. Their tempura is the best i've ever had$LABEL$5
Well$LABEL$2
Green Garden is not$LABEL$3
Yeah$LABEL$2
Ordered General Tso's shrimp$LABEL$3
Cool pool hall.  The front is a small neighborhood bar type of place that has good beer prices and almost everything seemed to be on special the night we were there.  The pool hall in the back was much bigger than I expected it to be.  There were a lot of tables and plenty of room.  If you see the \u20ac20 note hanging up on the wall that was from a friend of mine that donated it during our trip to Pittsburgh.$LABEL$3
Since moving to dormont$LABEL$3
Pool hall and pretty crappy bar. Not much else to write home about. Was not a fan and won't be back here.$LABEL$1
Brought the family to Tom's last weekend$LABEL$2
The service here was outstanding with a very friendly staff. I could not believe the amount of food we got for $7 per plate. Great food. Great prices. A new Pittsburgh favorite of mine.$LABEL$4
I can't comment on how it is for actual meals$LABEL$4
I know Tom's is a South Hills staple$LABEL$2
I've given this place enough 2nd chances and have had my last meal at this DIVE.Food is mediocre at best and you can't get any service because the wait staff is always outside having a cigarette. Very unappetizing to watchthem and the cook smoking then come back inside and NOT WASH THEIRHANDS. DISGUSTING !!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$1
Tom's Diner is a bit retro$LABEL$3
Open 24 hours is the key. Good food at any time. Gyros are their specialty and are very good. Remember it is a diner.  The decor is out dated.$LABEL$4
Tom's Diner is one of those places I really$LABEL$2
Any place where I can crack up$LABEL$4
I love how it's the only restaurant that is open 24 hours near Mt LebanonIt's always good food$LABEL$5
I came in and a waitress came to our table$LABEL$2
The food is ok and I like that they're 24 hours. One of the things that I don't like is that you sit yourself but you don't figure it out until a while. Waitress also take a while to take your order. Other than that is ok.$LABEL$3
Read my first review... loved this place... Today I stopped in to look around$LABEL$1
One of the best pastries I've had in my life I got here. I think it's called a \""French bearclaw.\$LABEL$5
Pastries are nice but I bought a cake for my sisters bridal shower and they PUT THE WORDING ON THE CAKE INCORRECTLY! it was a Saturday and \""could not call a baker in to fix it so they could refund me the cake and just take this one$LABEL$1
We were having a Gender Naming Party for our first baby and we were excited to share this moment with friends and family. When we went to pick up our cake we were extremely disappointed in the way the staff handled our order. The mother to be on picking up the cake found out the gender of the baby! Without her husband! This was supposed to be a surprise at the party but it was on the receipt. How terrible! They knew when we placed the order that this was supposed to be a secret. When confronted with their error they were dismissive$LABEL$1
This was the worst hotel that I ever stayed in. my hubby and I  took the smoking room and it stunk sooo bad that I wanted to throw up. I was afraid to sleep in that nasty bed. in the morning at 5am I wanted to leave the room cuz smell was sooo gross that woke me up! I felt so dirty that I took two showers AT Other HOTEL. I never thought that I will have nightmares bcz of bad and stinky hotel.$LABEL$1
I've never been to Pittsburgh before and I planned on doing some heavy partying and needed a place to crash that was not on the floor so I booked this hotel the day before I drove up. I saw the reviews & ignored them because I figured I'd be drunk and happy enough to dive into a bed.I checked in around 2am$LABEL$1
BED BUGS!!! Horrible place! DO NOT STAY HERE!! Stayed here for a wedding we attended. Woke up in the middle of the night with bites all over my legs$LABEL$1
Came back for the holidays$LABEL$3
Any pittsburgher knows the top 3 pizza joints: Beto's$LABEL$5
Being from Chicago$LABEL$3
Some of my favorite pizza on the planet. If you haven't had it remember$LABEL$5
From reading other reviews and dining guides$LABEL$1
Beto's is one of the childhood memories I'm most fondest of. I remember dear old dad and me getting in the car$LABEL$4
Sorry$LABEL$2
There are only so many ways to make the American bastardized version of a pizza$LABEL$2
This is my Man's favorite pizza place.  When he has visited Pittsburgh in the past without me$LABEL$4
I was out with lesbian friend of Joe D the night before new years eve. Note to self: veggie burgers are not a meal for a man. After seeing Harry Potter 7.1 at the theatre we both proclaimed we were hungry for abnormal pizza. Let me explain$LABEL$5
This is the kind of pizza where the toppings are added after the crust is cooked. Cheese included. It's a novelty$LABEL$2
Blah blah blah$LABEL$3
I tried the \""cold cheese and toppings\"" slice that Beto's is famous for.  If you have heard about there style of serving pizza$LABEL$2
I guess for what it is$LABEL$3
You have to be goofy to not like this pizza. Their sauce is tangy and delicious$LABEL$5
Canned green peppers!?! Way too much cheese. The yinzers seem to like it. The average BMI in that place was probably close to 30 and no wonder; the food is incredibly unhealthy. The pizza crust tasted like Pizza Hut. Maybe this place gets good reviews because it's a unique twist on unhealthy; loads of uncooked mozzarella.$LABEL$2
Wow$LABEL$2
I'm a fan of Betos. I like the fact that the cheese isn't always melted. The slices are square and the prices are reasonable. Ranch dressing or bleu cheese and you're good to go! The pizza itself is simple: crust$LABEL$3
This \""pizza\"" was the worst food I have ever eaten.$LABEL$1
So you walk in and proceed to the counter.  You order the pizza with whatever toppings you so desire.  You get handed your drink cups and a number to put on your table and try and find a seat.  Maybe a 15 to 20 minute wait for your pizza.  Your pizza comes out and...... \""what the hell is this?  Take this back!  My cheese ain't melted and the pepperoni ain't cooked!\""  Chill my man.....take a few deep breaths....it'll be ok.....just TASTE it......there ya go.....holy cheese right?!  What a blend....It's all over the place and people actually order extra!  That sauce$LABEL$5
I don't get it. Cold cheese and cold pepperoni on my pizza? Why does Pittsburgh have to be so weird? I just got accustomed to fries and coleslaw on my sandwiches but a guy has to draw the line somewhere. And what's with everyone bagging up their extra cheese and taking it home? My gut tells me this would be an awesome pizza if only they'd cook it.$LABEL$2
The pizza was fine. My issue is that$LABEL$2
Worse than store freezer pizza. What with the cold cheese on top of hot pizza? Terrible. If you want quality; Fiori's is a few miles away.$LABEL$1
First off$LABEL$2
The thing about Beto's is you either love it or you hate. I personally love it. The uniqueness of the cold toppings on the hot pizza is something that Beto's does perfectly. I've been a loyal customer for 10+ years and have continued to order 3 cuts with extra cheese every time. One of the biggest perks to Beto's is that it's family owned by a great group of people. This place is sure to not disappoint.$LABEL$4
Didn't live up to my expectations at all.  Waste of time and money.  Sloooooow service.$LABEL$2
Thinking cold toppings is going to tast great sounds odd....... But$LABEL$5
The pizza is ok. The tomato chunks are delicious and the pepperoni too. But they don't bake it and the stuff all slides off the crust. Overloaded too much with cheese . Not horrible but certainly not the best.$LABEL$3
Okay this place is freaking wild. If your from my generation than you can remember Ellio's rectangular frozen pizza. This place brings me back. Any place that goes there$LABEL$5
My husband and I had this pizza for the first time last night.  He suggested it after hearing recommendations from friends.  This was the most disgusting excuse for a pizza I've ever had! We ordered pizza for pick up.  The girl told my husband 20 minutes and he picked our pizza up in a timely fashion.  The best thing about this pizza was the crust.  That was it! It was cold! It was not even warm like it had been warmed up before my husband picked up our order.  We got two extra toppings$LABEL$1
Nowhere else quite like betos. If you love cheese and like trying something different this place is awesome.  I grew up in Pittsburgh and get back rarely$LABEL$5
One of my favorite pizza spots in Pittsburgh.  Been coming here for years.  The only downside is if you go and they are just putting a pizza into the oven.  The wait to grab your cuts can be a long wait.  Well worth it because of how damn good it is.$LABEL$5
Exactly what you'd imagine from an adorable neighborhood ice cream shop. When it's time to grab a cone$LABEL$4
Sweet little shop - great place to take the kiddos$LABEL$4
With the advent of the Super Bowl just a few days away$LABEL$3
I've never$LABEL$1
Banksville Beer is one of those places I very rarely have to shop at; I don't drink a ton of beer and given a choice between cider (which you can get here) and wine (not so much$LABEL$3
Mediocre and poorly made! You can get better quality food from Mcdonalds don't waste your time or money$LABEL$1
Eh$LABEL$3
I would give this eat n park location zero stars if I could. I arrived at 11:15am and was seated quickly but that was about it. My waitress did not come over until 11:41. I did not receive water or any service for 26 minutes.  That is outrageous to me$LABEL$1
My experience here was not good my family and I were seated all the way in the back of the Resturant near an exit after passing at least six tables upfront. We were the ONLY African Americans in the restaurants not even one as a busboy we had some stares but no one was rude just very quiet . The waitress tried to make us feel welcome so we thank her for that but the feeling was uneasy and on top of all that$LABEL$1
High production values$LABEL$4
My husband and I visited Lighting by Erik yesterday and were absolutely blown away with the amount of product in the store! This is the BEST place in Pittsburgh to find lighting. We were in the market for a nice crystal chandelier for our kitchen and had more than enough choices to pick from. We have had a hard time before yesterday finding a nice enough crystal chandelier in town (or getting good customer service from other stores). Also$LABEL$5
This store will not let you photograph their lighting fixtures. We browsed for a while and found a chandelier we liked$LABEL$1
This company was better when the father (William Wessner) owned and managed it. I bought both an AC system and high efficiency furnace from them. Since his two sons have taken over the business$LABEL$3
Metro came to my home as scheduled and restored my air conditioning. Rich was my Metro rep and explained everything so a layman could understand.I was completely satisfied. They do excellent work.I would use them again.$LABEL$5
I can't believe this place hasn't been reviewed. If you are thinking about going here know this:If you grew up in the South Hills$LABEL$2
Almost but not quite perfect. Cain's is a well-priced smoke free 1/2 bar 1/2 sports restaurant hybrid. The front has tall tables and chairs (like bar stool height) and the back has booths and 6 flatscreen TV's. The whole place was redone in 2009 when a new owner bought it$LABEL$4
Yum. I love when places surprise you! Brunch is my passion so I am always on the hunt for new spots. I love the Pamela's scene but sometimes you need that bloody mary to hold you off until you can dig into your home fries. BLOODY MARY BAR$LABEL$4
I think this placed has been re-modeled or at least that is what my buddy thought. I had never been there before so I had nothing to compare it to. They had over 25 beers on tap which was very nice. The menu seemed good and the appetizers we had were tasty. There were not a lot of places to sit but we found a couple of seats at a table. They have at least 4 or 5 TV's to watch whatever local sports are on. I think my friend will be going back more now that it has been updated and I will only be back on my next trip to Pittsburgh. Parking is street$LABEL$3
I've been to Cain's quite a few times$LABEL$2
Cains had great wings and good service. The Jamaican jerk wings were very crispy as I did request them to be extra well done. The jalepeno cheddar could have been a little more crispy. The sweet potato fries were delicious$LABEL$4
Good$LABEL$4
This place is another that is undeserving of your hard earned money!! The following is an email that I sent to the owner$LABEL$1
Draft selections are good...service is lousy...food is sub par. Not in a hurry to return.$LABEL$3
I wasn't expecting much but they surely over delivered.  I thought it was just another bar.  It had the bar vibe.  I didn't think the food would be this good.  I am impressed that most of the food is made in-house.  I actually don't remember what I got since it was several weeks ago that I went.  All I know was that the food was much better than any bar food I had.  I would come here again.$LABEL$5
Good local bar with lots of TVs$LABEL$5
Cain's Saloon has popped up on my radar repeatedly since it opened - many people have stood by it as a fantastic dinner spot and bar. And while I certainly didn't dislike my experience here overall I can't say I quite get what all the fuss is about.I came here for dinner and drinks with a friend and upon first entering we were pleased; the staff got us seats and our waitress very patiently helped us navigate their beer and cider options - which took a while$LABEL$3
Our night at Cain started out as 4/5 stars.  This was my first visit and I was blown away by the extensive menu and attentive service.  I ordered the Shrimp and Strawberry salad - not something I would usually order at a bar.  But I was not disappointed! The shrimp were of a decent size and seasoned well. The salad was huge and at $12 was just right.  My guests ordered a variety of items including Buffalo Chicken dip (amazing); Spinach Artichoke Dip (great); and for their entrees - the Grilled Romaine salad topped with Filet; Surf and Turf ($14 - WHAT?); and a Steak and Egg something sandwich. Everyone seemed delighted with their respective meals and the drinks flowed all night long thanks to our wonderful server whose name I cannot recall.  Unfortunately$LABEL$3
Stopped in for breakfast today.Pros: -we were seated almost immediately$LABEL$3
Great food and very reasonable prices.   Really enjoy the sandwich and big orders of tasty fries.$LABEL$4
This place is just average. The service is subpar at best and the waitresses always seem rushed. However$LABEL$2
Great food and atmosphere. Sweet potato waffle fries are the best. Great for Pirate games.$LABEL$5
Great place to watch a game. Friendly staff went out of their way to get my game on even though the Steelers were on at the same time.$LABEL$5
I had heard a lot of different things about Cain's before coming here for the first time around 2pm on a Sunday afternoon. What I heard was true after dining here- food is really good$LABEL$3
Ok.  This used to be our favorite spot in the area but the past two times we have been here were not the best.   Today's meal was cold burnt and  rubbery.  We had fish and chips.  Burnt mushy fish and cold over cooked chips.  Loaded potato soup was so thick you could use it for paste.  The app we had was the best part of the meal.   The last time we wets here my fianc\u00e9 got food poisoning from a burger special.   I'm beginning to think we need to go elsewhere from now on.$LABEL$3
The wings here are fantastic and the cheese sticks are absurd in a very good way. Will definitely be back.$LABEL$5
I love this place. Normally$LABEL$5
I assume lots of folks have seen this place featured on Food Network's Diners$LABEL$4
Went this this morning and I am wondering why the hell it tool me so long to go here. Awesome food$LABEL$5
This is what a diner should be.  Yummy$LABEL$4
Oh man$LABEL$4
Been here twice. Hate to say it but nothing special. The usual breakfast items but nothing stands out either in preparation or presentation.$LABEL$2
My breakfast was absolutely phenomenal. I specifically ordered the ham and eggs because it included their famous potato pancakes. They did not disappoint I tried every trick in the book to get what they put in them but no luck. I even promised some things I should be ashamed of LOL I would definitely recommend that if you are anywhere within 50 miles you need to make a trip here!$LABEL$5
I had no idea that this restaurant was \""legendary\"" when I decided to eat there this morning with my family.  I was severely hungover and just needed some grease$LABEL$5
Met some friends for breakfast.  We had 5 and there were no tables available on our arrival.  The hostess said we can have the table for 4 with someone seating in the window box$LABEL$3
This is the second review of The Dor- Stop$LABEL$4
Like many others before me I came to the Dor-Stop with high expectations and let me tell you$LABEL$5
The Dor-Stop was crowded and we did have to wait for about 10 minutes.  Not to bad on a Sunday morning.  Waitress was quick to get coffee to us.  It did take a little longer than you would expect to get the meal...we all started to get really hungry.  Ordered the Eggs Benedict$LABEL$3
We've been here several times$LABEL$3
Yelpers$LABEL$5
Ahhh Dor-Stop. A nice little brunch spot. I ordered the egg combo this time around. The eggs were average$LABEL$4
Don't go for healthy$LABEL$5
Another 5-star find in the Pittsburgh area. I kid you not. Guy Fieri hyped the right place.  It is hands down the best diner in the universe.  Actually$LABEL$5
Guy's Jumbot Plate O'Crap - Made a special trip in with my son this morning to enjoy the food at the Dor-Stop.We both made the same order Guy's Jumbot. When the order arrived mine was over cooked$LABEL$1
My in-laws saw the Dor-Stop on DDD and wanted to try it out. When I found out they were famous for their pancakes$LABEL$5
Another DDD spot to cross off my list. First one in the East Coast!I was intrigued with their pumpkin pancakes and raspberry stuffed french toast when I watched the segment on DDD. Finally had the opportunity when I visited by brother for his graduation at Carnegie Mellon. The wait time is killer$LABEL$4
This place just plain had it all$LABEL$5
While the Dor-Stop is a cute place on a nice tree lined street$LABEL$2
My husband and I were looking for a new place to try for brunch on Labor Day. Instead of going to our standby$LABEL$3
My dad and I do a yearly trip to a different city to see the NY Mets play.  Yeah I'm a Mets fan and live in California.  Anyway back in May of 2012$LABEL$4
Excellent breakfast. Regular pancakes rocked. Staff was super and we were seated immediately on a Saturday. So lucky. My first 5 star rating on Yelp.$LABEL$5
WOW!  Great staff and great food.  Got in quick and got out quick and cheap.  Did the regular breakfast with 2 pumpkin hot cakes on the side and they were out of this world.I'm glad they were on YELP or I never would have none of my new favorite breakfast place.TC$LABEL$5
Went there with a friend. Had egg Benedict and did not like it. The turkey meat smells funny. And the waitress kept rushing us. Not sure why it's so crowded. Will not visit again.$LABEL$3
I've been going to Dor-Stop for years (well before the DDD crowd arrived).  While I'm thrilled to see Bob and Vicky's crew thriving$LABEL$5
Tonya our waitress was perfect! Her recommendations we all excellent! From Chicago attending a funeral. Checked triple-D$LABEL$5
AMAZING!  I've been wanting to try this place for years and finally made it.  Ever since I saw it featured on the Food Network I've been wanting to go.We went for breakfast and I ordered the stuffed raspberry french toast.  I ended up getting the cherry though...  I took a bite and while it was good I really wanted the raspberry.  I let them know and they quickly replaced my order with what I wanted and took it totally off the bill because they felt bad I had to wait longer for my food.  That was really unexpected and really nice!Once I tried the raspberry stuffed french toast I loved it$LABEL$5
This place has NEVER disappointed when it comes to the food coming out of their kitchen. The lines occasionally go out the door but the wait is never very long. I have had many different items off the menu as it is a place my girlfriend and I frequent.If you can ever get the Sausage Gravy and Biscuits$LABEL$5
I'm not ashamed to admit it - I was skeptical.  As a long-time lover of Pamela's$LABEL$5
BEST BREAKFAST I'VE EVER HAD!!! I had the Guy's Version of the Jumblot. My girlfriend had the chocolate chip banana pancakes. These were the best pancakes I've ever eaten. They have a texture and gooeyness that I've never had in a pancake. The Guy's Version was eggs$LABEL$5
Yes... Dorstop was on the Food Network but I believe that the show has brought too much business to the local breakfast/lunch restaurant. Most of the time the servers are cranky and rushing so they forget items or customer needs and the food isn't as good as it used to be. Either they need to expand their staff and restaurant or many others will see what I have.$LABEL$3
Folks this is very overrated.. they had Guy's Diners Drivein and Dives there only because Guy's parents knew owner. This is very avg food at best. Its nothing special.I wont go back.. Very small and uncomfortable. They have a large sign in window to play on Guy's visit a number of years ago. Dont fall for it.$LABEL$2
I've been here twice$LABEL$3
For what it's worth$LABEL$1
I really$LABEL$1
Ok$LABEL$2
Food here is absolutely wonderful! Service is good and people are better. Take my family there and am extremely satisfied.$LABEL$5
My sister and I both got the banana and chocolate chip hot cakes$LABEL$5
Best pancakes in Pittsburgh besides DeLucas. Always delicious and the service is nice.$LABEL$5
great breakfast place...period. worth the wait. had the stuffed french toast$LABEL$4
I had the Italian jombot here it was so good$LABEL$5
Shortly after moving to Dormont$LABEL$4
I have been to The Dor-Stop numerous times and never been disappointed. They are known for their pancakes as featured on The Food Network's \""Diners$LABEL$5
Ladies and Gentleman$LABEL$5
Pancakes$LABEL$1
I will never forget Campiti's. As a youngster growing up playing on Potomac Avenue and Dormont. My favorite pizza was and still is Campiti's. I have not found an equal in the 18 years I have been in CA. The hoagies were pretty damn good too.$LABEL$5
We were in Pittsburgh from out of town and read the reviews so we decided on Don Campiti's Pizza. Urban Spoon rated 91% favorite. This pizza is not good. Honestly$LABEL$2
Camp's has a cult following.   As soon as you walk in you can smell the melting mozzarella.  Love that smell.  W grew up on Camp's and is almost in the cult$LABEL$3
Great pie...I could eat a whole large though...if you like a thin crust$LABEL$4
People really are nuts about their pizza in the 'burgh - this I'm learning. I ordered a pizza from here because it's in my hood (walking distance$LABEL$2
Consistent and quality.  Although it might be a love it or hate it thing.  I love it$LABEL$4
Disappointed after hearing so many good things. Pizza crust is like a cracker. Hoagie is pretty good$LABEL$2
Compared to the original Don Campiti Pizza of the 60's and 70's this is not even close. The legacy of a superior pizza in Dormont has lost it. No longer up there with Beto's and area best. Sad to say this pizza was so bad. I have been a diehard customer of the 60's and 70's. Crust was like cardboard. Toppings were worse. What happened to the legacy Don Campitis Pizza ?$LABEL$1
When my car died$LABEL$1
You know it's bad when you get in your car practically in tears because of how bad the haircut is. Having curly hair$LABEL$1
My husband and I have been coming here for the past six years and cannot say enough about the salon.  Prior to finding Geno Como$LABEL$5
Short of getting on my hands and knees and begging the stylist to cut ONE HALF of an INCH$LABEL$1
I am not impressed.  The food was so-so and my boyfriend and I had a coupon purchased that morning from restaurants.com and they wouldn't accept it. I bought it that morning$LABEL$2
Mediocre  Food  Service and Atmosphere.Better to stay clear and save your money.  Judging from the empty tables the luster and joy of the Namaste we remembered is no longer.We experienced the following sub par  dishes while dining after 8 pm on a Friday evening in an empty restaurant:Bland reheated Samosas.Flavorless Malek Paneer. ( the cheese pcs were quite good despite)  inconsistent  and barely there flavors of certainly fresh frozen spinach mix. Barely reheated Naan. We traveled to eat at Namaste specifically based on delightful past experience. Obviously that feeling is long gone.  The staff  were content to chat with friends and answer frequent texts and cell phone calls while we ate. The loud thump of bass from modern indian music with the  electric din of the TV playing Bollywood extracts might have been a nice distraction in a busy restaurant.  Instead  when added to the ding of texts and cell phone calls the loud background noises detracted rather than added  anything to an already mediocre dining experience.$LABEL$2
I really liked this food. I'm not Indian$LABEL$4
Just to let everyone know$LABEL$4
I was very excited to try this place since the closure of Maharaja left us without a good Indian buffet on the side of Pittsburgh where I live$LABEL$2
This was probably one of the worst places I've eaten at in a while . I'm not sure what was worse food or service . Never again$LABEL$1
Hard to complain too much about a $7 buffet.   Food wasn't bad$LABEL$3
I have dined at Namaste for the final time.  I am tired of being served by an individual that does not speak: who treats the customer with disdain and indifference.  The words \""thank you\"" and \""how are you\"" are not part of the lexicon here.  The buffet items reflect economizing.  Virtually no cauliflower is used$LABEL$1
Here is our experience on my friend's daughter's birthday party:-I and my wife attended my friend's daughter's birthday party here recently. My friend mentioned that they finalized the menu for the lunch buffet a week in advance. The restaurant chef at the last moment on the day of party$LABEL$1
Shockingly bad.  I know it's Pittsburg so my expectations were low$LABEL$1
I think the quality and flavor of the food keeps me coming back even though the old woman is very unpleasant$LABEL$3
It's kinda strange when you enter because you literally hit the hotel's registration counter$LABEL$3
This place is crazy! It's an Indian restaurant located within a Days Inn. I love it because it's so quirky. Go for the buffet. Don't bother with the menu. The buffet is just as unique as the location of the restaurant. They usually have several vegetarian options and some meat options also. What makes this buffet so different is the fact that it has malai kofta$LABEL$3
I cannot believe how anyone can like this place. May be the service was bad the day I went. I walked in .... then found that the place had a smell that was not pleasant. But$LABEL$1
Agree with chaitiyana. This place is pretty bad. The food isn't fresh. They have a Buffet even for dinner. I stayed at Days Inn for 2wks here and was forced to eat here a few times. The mango lassi was good$LABEL$2
Maharaja is located in the Days Inn on Banksville Rd$LABEL$1
This is pretty close to where we live so we eat there quite a bit. Freshness of food really is hit or miss. I like all of the veggie options there. I think it's a great place to take someone who has never had Indian food. Buffet style lets someone new to this kind of food try a bit of everything. The mango lassi is always delicious! I like that it's NEVER busy$LABEL$3
I'm not about reviewing fast food places$LABEL$2
I actually don't mind the Arby's chain; I certainly don't go to one on a regular basis$LABEL$1
This is a very typical neighborhood Foodland.  It looks like it hasn't been renovated since the days of the Steelers \""Immaculate Reception\$LABEL$2
It's an IGA now.$LABEL$2
Eh$LABEL$3
The white pizza truly is delicious$LABEL$3
Bado's is a definite neighborhood joint.  Located on Beverly in Mt. Lebo$LABEL$3
I love this place. I live within walking distance and I find myself there a lot. Tons of beer choices (microbrews for you beer snobs) and great pizza & pub food.  It's a perfect pizza pub in every way. Try the hot lime flavored wings. They make your eyes well up when you put your face over them to smell the amazing wing aroma. Nice bartenders and wait staff as well.$LABEL$5
Meh. At best. So I went to Bado's tonight w/ my dad and sister and it was a bit lackluster. I started out with chicken noodle soup (w/ no noodles) and a very spicy bloody ( I know. I know. I am an avid evening bloody mary drinker.) The bloody mary was pretty awesome for what I assume is a pre-made mix. I also got a grilled swordfish salad which was bland as hell! Iceberg lettuce$LABEL$2
Friday evening$LABEL$3
This is a popular place so usually skip it due to a short wait list...just don't want to wait  for pizza and so many pizza shops in the area.  No wait on this Friday night.  Bado's has  all that you need..a good beer selection$LABEL$3
Hostess was very awkward when seating us. Sat us in the corner in a small booth with a broken seat right up against another large party. The place was by no means busy. We sat and waited for someone to acknowledge us. We watched 4 members of the wait staff each attend to the 4 other tables and not one of them ever acknowledged us or came over. After 15 minutes of being ignored by staff$LABEL$1
I went with my boyfriend and one of his coworkers to this joint for lunch last week. As the rating suggests - meh.It wasn't terrible and the service was fine. I just feel like I've had much better pizza elsewhere around town. And for sure a better margherita. Theirs fell into the category that I find most end up in: a regular cheese pizza. Quite a few places seem to not understand the differences between the two$LABEL$2
I have been a patron of Bado's several times now$LABEL$4
If I lived in the South Hills I would come here all the time. I am not even sure how the pizza place across the street stays in business. I suspect that after the locals are done getting hammered off of Bado's awesome beer selection they need to order some crap when homebase has closed. Or it is a front for the mob.$LABEL$4
Bado's is a nice place to go to get decent food. Pretty average as far as I've seen so far. The reason for 3 stars is that the bar is small and the beer is over priced. I understand it's micro and craft beers on tap but there are other places near by with the micro and crafts for less with better atmosphere. Big plus to the bartenders though$LABEL$3
pricey$LABEL$1
I just want to like it due to its location and great beer selection$LABEL$2
one of the worst steak sandwiches i've ever eaten. there were 7 of us and the only people who liked their food were the kids and the one who had the pizza. i would never eat here again$LABEL$1
We just ate there on a Friday night and the whole experience was a disaster. Rude$LABEL$1
I am not being hyperbolic when I say that my last experience here was the worst food experience I have ever had. I have eaten at Bado's before and have had pizza that was pretty tasty. So when my roomate wanted to go there$LABEL$1
best pizza on beverly rd$LABEL$4
Had the gnocchi delivered. Absolutely terrible. Gnocci's had to have been 2 years old. Delivery guy was shady too.$LABEL$1
Got into Pittsburgh late this evening and this was the only place around that was still open and delivered after 11 pm. I give them a half star for this. They have a few vegetarian choices on the menu. I give them another half star for this. I ordered what I thought would have the most vegetables$LABEL$2
I don't like this place at all. The staff here is always rude and has no sense of care at all for their business. A couple years ago I had heard they smoke over making their pizza. All of their employees tend to be shady. I don't recommend at all.$LABEL$1
What a cool place! I have NO green thumb WHATSOEVER$LABEL$5
I had a positive experience with this shop. I needed something framed at the last minute$LABEL$4
I wish there were negative stars I could put for this place.  One of the most unprofessional experiences I have ever had with a business owner$LABEL$1
Well returned to Supercuts this afternoon and they agreed that my hair was a little...well...oddly cut behind the ears. Gina (manager) offered to blend it in$LABEL$3
Meh. I hate how this store is laid out$LABEL$3
An abomination....the billing department is run by a level of incompetence of which the likes have never been seen.  Ever get a bill 2 yrs late$LABEL$1
Absolutely wretched and incompetent billing department.  Overcharged four months in a row$LABEL$1
Come here instead of D's if you need to buy cases of beer. They're cheaper than D's and everything is easy to find. Thanks to the peeps at D's for the referral.$LABEL$4
Cons:* Very cramped space$LABEL$2
It would get 4 stars for the name alone.  The idea that they would just sell you hot dogs and six-packs is so just and pure it almost makes me want to weep.  I went here and had the bacon chili cheddar dog and one with relish$LABEL$5
This place was great! I was a little bit let down by the Chicago hot dog as it had too much mustard. That said$LABEL$4
This place came highly recommended when I moved to Pittsburgh two years ago. They have an amazing beer selection$LABEL$3
It's getting three stars for the beer selection.  The hot dogs are nothing special$LABEL$3
This place is no longer the cool hole-in-the-wall place to get a hot dog and beer (from a good selection).  They've expanded and that is both good and bad in my mind.  I liked the small$LABEL$4
Love the BEER CAVE - would make any beer-neanderthal happy! Sorta like grabbing a cold one out of your friend's fridge$LABEL$3
good beer selection- both on tap and in the beer cave. located in a nice neighborhood.  the chili cheese dog is fantastic and so are the fries!!$LABEL$4
Their chicken BBQ pizza is among the greaseiest I've ever consumed$LABEL$4
Made my first trip to D's today.  By far one of the best bars I have been to.  Great atmosphere$LABEL$5
The hot dogs are somewhat disappointing and the beer is slightly overpriced$LABEL$3
Even though they were out of the first beers we asked for (the Dogfish Punkin) this place hit the spot for a junk food craving. Vegetarians: the veggie dog is awesome$LABEL$3
Best beer selection and bar food I've ever had- anywhere. The Vienna Beef hot dogs are delicious and the Buffalo wings the best in the 'burgh. The kielbasa and fish sandwiches are solid$LABEL$5
The name itself is pretty self explanatory.  You can pretty much get a hot dawg any way you like it.  Although I've never tried a Chicago Dog in Chicago$LABEL$4
I come here for the veggies dogs. My husband comes here for the beer cave. The beer is a bit expensive (compared to buying it in stores in NY). But if you're craving your favorite difficult to find because of the crazy PA licquor laws$LABEL$4
This is probably my favorite bar in Pittsburgh.  The pizza is solid$LABEL$5
What a cool place.  The beercave was very unique.  If I hadn't just had my wisdom teeth out$LABEL$4
Well$LABEL$3
Place was awesome.Delirium on tap.Hot dogs with mac n cheese on them.$LABEL$5
In my final meal in Pittsburgh$LABEL$4
Rupe Rankings of note:- #1: crave factor- #1: signature sandwich (hotdog)- #1: beer selection- #2: pizza- #2: friesMenu recommendations:- chili cheese dog- scorpassi (kielbasa with jalapenos)- garden pizza- plain fries- any brew you haven' t had or from blue point$LABEL$5
good selection of beers*$LABEL$2
This is our favorite neighborhood restaurant. They serve \""bar food\$LABEL$5
I'm over it. Too many instances of bad service. Though that one woman who I have seen working there for a long time is solid. But going back to what I started with; seems like the inmates are running the prison these days. The beer to-go costs more here than it does in New York City or Brooklyn. Think about that people.(The Monroeville location is better$LABEL$2
I think their beer selection is much more impressive than their hot dog selection. although$LABEL$3
Everybody told me about this place when I said I was moving to Pittsburgh and$LABEL$5
I go to D's almost every Wednesday night for a beer and a veggie dog after an hour of bouldering at the Wall.Their beer selection changes often$LABEL$5
Awesome. That is D's.Burgers$LABEL$5
A day after the St. Patty's day libations the only thing I'm craving is some greasy junk food. Regent square hits the spot with some chili cheese fries straight from D's. Normally I enjoy fishing around the plentiful selection of booze. A hair of the dog was not gonna happen that hangover Sunday. I stuck to shoveling high calorie food into my gullet instead.The last time I was here I selected from the hot dog menu$LABEL$3
This place is one of the reasons we decided to move to Regent Square. I am not really a huge hot dog fan$LABEL$4
Sometimes I get these intense cravings to stuff hot dogs and greasy french fries in my face. As someone who doesn't eat meat$LABEL$5
This place is pretty good! they serve a selection of creatively topped dogs and some of the best greasy fries I have had in awhile. enough said!  Time to go drink some beer and devour this dog!$LABEL$4
D's has so many great things about it$LABEL$4
Beer cave!!$LABEL$5
I go here a lot.  I think most folks who live in Regent Square/Swissvale/Edgewood area do too.  And it's probably not because the food is so utterly delicious.  It's because it's a groovy little place with young hipster (and some not so hipster) bartenders and waitresses that serves up an endless array of beers in a funky loud space.  I love Regent Square and always saw the potential for the grand old days of Hippy Free Love lying dormant in her quaint shops and family eateries ... until D's sprang to life in a former dry cleaner/gun shop space.  Oh yes$LABEL$4
D's quite possibly has the best beer selection in Pittsburgh. There are always 20 micro brews on tap and they rotate seasonally. Last time I went they had a variety of pumpkin beers and I pretty much tried them all to figure out which I liked best. If you aren't feeling any of the beers on tap then take a stroll to the walk in cooler in the back and take your pick of hundreds of bottles. Bring the one you like back to the bar and the bartender will open it for you and bring you a glass. The bartenders are really chill$LABEL$4
Obviously the great rep of this place is their beer selection.  A lot of bottles.  Decent tap selection$LABEL$2
I'm a vegetarian and everything$LABEL$3
Sometimes the service here is hit or miss...they can get pretty busy. It can also get pretty crowded. But the food is good and the atmosphere is fun and laid back. And can you beat a room filled with beer? Can you beat mix and match six packs? Nope. 35 cent wing night$LABEL$4
I am not huge on hot dogs or beer. However$LABEL$4
I have been to Pittsburgh several times in the last year and this place is one of my favorites.  Not just because the hot dogs are good and variety or them is pretty good too.  I come just for the beer cave!  Plenty of choice in there and the ability to pick your own is awesome!  It gets pretty packed in there on weekends.  Service is no nonsense.  Best is the beer selection in the cave.  This is the reason for the 4stars.$LABEL$4
D's looks unassuming$LABEL$5
Something different here.Food$LABEL$4
My husband and I live walking distance to D's and we do love D's... but the place is always so crowded and noisy$LABEL$3
D's is just one of those places I love going to. I can't get enough of picking out my own 6 pack of wonderfulness. All amazing beer. The food has never let me down. The service has always been good. This place is just awesome.$LABEL$5
The mac n cheese dog I had was just ok$LABEL$4
Yum! Great little find just outside of the city....especially if you are Chicago dog fan$LABEL$4
UPDATE: July 2013Went back for a visit to the alma mater and decided to stop in at D's before heading out. I have updates on the gluten-free beer situation and the nacho situation.GF Beer: MUCH improved from what I remember. They had at least three varieties of the \""deglutenized\"" beers - Estrella Damm Daura and both the Amber and Blonde Brunehaut (from Belgium!). They MAY have had Omission as well. They also have at least three varieties of New Planet$LABEL$4
Generally$LABEL$3
I like it. Veggie friendly too.$LABEL$4
Chicago dog was awesome. Great selection of craft beers on draft too!$LABEL$4
I don't come here to eat much$LABEL$5
New menu! Check it out!$LABEL$4
Was in town for a recent sporting event and read good things about Ds. A bit off the beaten path$LABEL$5
Employees are awesome. Everyone is super friendly and they always have kick ass old school jams playing!$LABEL$5
I tried to go here for the second time today.  I say tried because I sat at the bar for about 7 mins with 3 people walking around behind it and no one even acknowledging I was there.  I ended up going next door to The Map Room for lunch.The first time I had gone I had a server come and take my order$LABEL$1
I'm subleasing an apt across the street and have been in a few times now.  Hot dogs are good and cheap but the burger options$LABEL$4
While I'm not much of a beer fan$LABEL$4
Came here for lunch after a long day on the roadIt's a beer and bar place.They have a variety of beer$LABEL$4
D'z is hands down my favorite go to spot for good eats. I love their wings and their hot dogs. Everytime I go there i am greeted with fun young employees ready to serve or offer suggestions about their latest brews. Their draft list changes constantly so there's no sense in trying to remember which beer you had there the week before. Plus their beer cave is great with hundreds of different bottles to choose from all listed by the region from which they came. They also have a small cooler with about 150 different varieties of beer that are already chilled for your liking. Even if you get a warm beer$LABEL$5
Went here after a run in nearby Frick Park$LABEL$5
Last night was my first time at D's. The beer cave was amazing! I'm not a fan of beer but can appreciate a vast selection. I went straight for the cider. The lively energy of this place was incontestable. No frills$LABEL$4
The food is always sort of room temperature$LABEL$3
Was at D's this afternoon! I was so excited to find real vienna Hot Dogs in Pittsburgh since I am a born and raised Chicago guy. They were good dogs$LABEL$5
I am a fan of this place.  I love the dogs$LABEL$4
D's is one of our favorite places in Pittsburgh. It's nice to have an easy$LABEL$5
D's has been hovering among my Pittsburgh bookmarks for a couple of years now$LABEL$4
\""Meh\"" is kind of how I felt about this place$LABEL$3
D's is a great place to drink to your heart's content with any darn beer you please! They have just about any beer your little mug could possibly conjure up. The service is quick$LABEL$4
Mac n cheese dog is incredible.  This place is small and gets packed so be prepared for a long wait and no personal space.$LABEL$5
I absolutely loved this place. First off$LABEL$5
I love D's! My roommate and I are happy regulars at both the restaurant and the attached beer cave$LABEL$5
While awaiting the arrival of your wedding dress$LABEL$1
I went to pick up my wife's bridesmaid dress (she was the maid of honor) on a very boring Wednesday afternoon around 12:30. From the outside the place looks like a bomb shelter with dresses in the window.The show room is upstairs$LABEL$1
I was pleased that Candalina Bide ordered my gown as a rush and it did arrive in time for the wedding.  The downside:  the alterations were very expensive and very poorly done.  The hem looked as if a high student just learning to sew had done it and I had to make some repairs and press the hem once I got it home.  The alterations to the bodicve were incomplete and i ended up with a poor fit and lots of excess materialright across the bust.  I would order from them again$LABEL$2
Last Friday I dropped off my best interview suit at Regency Cleaners and verified that I needed it back by Monday because of an interview on Wednesday. They assured me I could pick it up on Monday morning. Monday afternoon I stopped by and was told the suit wouldn't be there until 5:00PM. When I insisted that I had been told morning$LABEL$1
Worst dry cleaners EVER.  Not only do they do an incredibly poor job on the clothes$LABEL$1
I only got a tear in my sweater sewn together$LABEL$2
I just moved to the neighborhood and needed to find a dry cleaner close by. Regency Cleaners is fine for dry cleaning but do not entrust any tailoring or hemming to this place! I had the sleeves of my coat hemmed and the tailor (or whoever) did a shitty job (THANKS).The owner (larger woman) is rude and dismissive of my questions.I won't be coming here again.$LABEL$2
Fun bar$LABEL$3
There's a reason why there are only two reviews currently for this place. Maybe it's that spending thirty minutes in the main bar area will make you spontaneously asphyxiate.  They seriously need to invest in an air purifier.  The bar itself is a huge space$LABEL$2
For what it is$LABEL$3
Yeah it's dirty and smoky$LABEL$3
I have been in this bar many times with a friend of mine (who has been a patron for decades) and I thought the owners were really nice people but now I wonder.  My friend is now confined to a wheelchair and still likes to frequent this bar$LABEL$1
Let me start off by saying$LABEL$1
Dunning's Grill is another one of those solid neighborhood joints.  Nothing on the menu here'll surprise you$LABEL$3
Yeah$LABEL$2
Dark$LABEL$2
Ok$LABEL$3
It's got it's ups and downs.  It's got a reasonably attractive interior$LABEL$2
Average food$LABEL$2
My first visit was tonight$LABEL$4
I live in the neighborhood and love to patron local establishments. However$LABEL$3
I really wanted to like this place$LABEL$2
I haven't actually been to the Regent Square location of Ambience$LABEL$5
I decided to visit the reagent square location after reading the great reviews on here and i wasn't disappointed. Parking was relatively easy to get (Tuesday afternoon). The store is well organized not too overwhelming like most thrift/vintage stores. They carried alot of Jcrew$LABEL$4
I am updating my review of the Oakmont store after my last experience consigning there. The store employee happily accepted all of my items- until the next day when I received a call that the owner rejected half of the items. This was the third time I consigned with Ambiance in Oakmont$LABEL$2
Right$LABEL$2
The drive through service here leaves something to be desired.  Not only was my order wrong but the lady was very grumpy.$LABEL$2
This place continues to be a joke.  The service is bad and the attitude of the workers is worse.  My order is never right and yet I still go...never again.  I officially deem this place the worst restaurant in Pittsburgh.$LABEL$1
Worst service.  Dirty.  Slow.  Ignorant by the strictest definition.  Do not go here.  Bad!  Real bad.$LABEL$1
While the shop is in a pretty great location$LABEL$2
I really want to see small coffee shops succeed$LABEL$2
This is a depressing coffee shop. I went in on a wednesday afternoon to find the place dim$LABEL$2
Regent Square is a nice little area$LABEL$2
Yeah$LABEL$2
Inattentive staff.  Dirty tables$LABEL$1
I really want this place to be awesome$LABEL$1
Yeah$LABEL$2
Is it possible to give zero stars?  If so$LABEL$1
Cigarette smoke and ashtray smells combined with mediocre coffee and subpar customer service are not my cup of tea$LABEL$2
This place is now closed :-). Best thing that could've been done with it.  Going to opn in a couple of months under new management as the 61B caf\u00e9. I look forward to seeing what some new life does to this place!$LABEL$1
I don't know why you would go anywhere else. The fellow who runs this shop is what I think of as a traditional businessman. He's got a trade$LABEL$5
I brought a shoe here that needed re-glued and it was done the next day and was so cheap.  The store owner was very friendly.  Would definitely do business here again.$LABEL$5
Amazing...The owner of this establishment is honest$LABEL$5
THE best cheesesteaks$LABEL$5
Passable$LABEL$3
Huge$LABEL$4
Think fresh bread$LABEL$5
Just go here$LABEL$5
I have been a customer of the Triangle Bar & Grill for over twenty five years.  They have the BEST subs ever. BUT on this trip I was buying several to share with people from out of town.  They are cash only and more than happy to show you an ATM that charges you $2.50 per transaction.  The employees don't set the rules but have to live with them.  That $2.50 came out of their tip$LABEL$2
After 17 years of only being able to choose between three pizza chains$LABEL$5
Great pizza. Grandma's pie is an all time favorite!$LABEL$5
Pizza was fine but nothing special. The salad I ordered was wrong$LABEL$2
This is the closest grocery store to me$LABEL$2
This store is so gross that I was almost sick! Onions peeled and half-rotten. Squishy garlic. Dirt everywhere. I will NEVER step foot in this place again.$LABEL$1
This Giant Eagle just went through a recent face lift renovation. I can't speak to the employees or the cleanliness of the store$LABEL$3
I really don't get Giant Eagle. They are nice enough$LABEL$2
Fairly typical chain grocery store. Although I have my reasons for liking them:1) Discounted Kennywood Tickets2) Good selection of Pittsburgh Specific food (i.e. Isaley's Chipped ham$LABEL$3
I love that most of their employees make it known that they would rather be anywhere else but here. The prices are higher than most other competitors but it's the closest store to us so it's easy to get to.$LABEL$2
One of the worst Wendy's I've ever experienced.  Every morning there was a 30-minute wait - after ordering - for food.$LABEL$1
Best Wendy's experience I've ever had! And I wouldn't normally take the time to review fast food. We went just after midnight following a long and tiring day of moving. The idea was to hit up the Eat'N'Park over by Giant Eagle$LABEL$5
I don't remember the last time I stepped into a fast food burger joint.  Every time I come here$LABEL$3
Please clean your floor properly.  It feels like Crisco under your feet.  Very dangerous.$LABEL$2
Wow. I hope that the one experience I had here was unique and not the norm for frequent customers. All I wanted to do was to buy some thermal socks (which they didn't even have any for men!  ???). I just ended up grabbing the next best thing (Oddly$LABEL$1
A couple times a month there is a swing dance at Edgewood on Sundays. Frequently featuring a live band$LABEL$4
My first visit to the chain in years. Not exactly fine dining but this was open until midnight on weekdays.I had roast beef sliders and a bowl of French onion soup. The sandwich buns were mushy otherwise everything was fairly good.Service was very good. Meal clocked in around $15 with tip which I think is 3 or 4 too high. Much more extensive menu than Denny's along with a bar if you happen to need a late night fill up.$LABEL$3
Consistent service @ the bar w Chuck pouring drafts and mixing up fruity delights. Decent food - don't expect great. Lots of under 500 calorie and Weight Watcher items. Several tv's to watch games. You'll find everyone from book-reading wives that didn't want to cook to laborers grabbing a cheap steak & a few cold ones to huge celebrations filling many tables. It's a great community asset for many.  The Ritz$LABEL$3
First off$LABEL$1
Nothing special. Precooked meals that taste microwaved.$LABEL$2
Normally one would think$LABEL$1
Worst Applebee's experience I've had.We were seated and then waited 10 minutes to even be greeted.  And then it was only because we flagged someone down.  No apologies when we were finally taken care of.I needed to ask for water three times before I finally went up to the bar to ask for some.  It was then that our server came over with water.  We ordered soup and entrees.  He delivered one soup and an appetizer claiming that was what we ordered and there was no way he misheard.About five minutes later a manager came over and said something to the lines of \""I understand that you've had some issues\""  I then proceeded to very calmly explain what our issues had been.  You could tell he wasn't very interested in what we had to say and didn't seem to care that his server had issues.  His lack of caring was apparent in the fact that while we were waiting to be greeted and during one of the many asks for water$LABEL$2
I told everyone that I wasn't feeling this. Should have listened to my gut on this one. We didn't make reservations for our party of 7$LABEL$2
Another overdone steak and utterly inattentive staff! Still sitting here waiting for someone to give a care.So$LABEL$1
With this location being at a busy intersection off an exit from the Parkway makes it almost a nightmare to use this place.  Hardly any parking if you don't need to actually get gas.The inside of the store is on the small side as well.  Doesn't help that the store part is changing from the BP branded store to a 7-eleven.  I swear that they decided it was amazing to put in an ATM that was four times the size than what was there before.  Be careful not to trip over the loose floor tiles as well.Not very many choices for gas off the Edgewood/Swissvale exit$LABEL$3
Fair prices.  Consistent Octane rating.  I've never been inside.  Also I think this station is very busy so the premium my car burns always seems to go a little further on a tank from here.  Not sure why but I also always get 20 more miles out of a tank if I fill up here instead of getgo or costco.$LABEL$4
They took their vegetarian meal off the menu.  They'll make one for you especially but I always feel demanding and would prefer if they had just kept it on the menu.Plus$LABEL$2
I have been going to Benihana's back when it was Samuri... I visit the Cleveland and Pittsburgh one frequently. The cleveland one is better but they are both going down hill at a very fast past. I keep giving them another chance and i keep getting disappointed. They have changed so many things in the past year and its for the worse. The shrimp the order they give you the food$LABEL$2
I like this place it provides a great atmosphere and can handle big groups. They also send you a coupon for a free dinner on your birthday and can use it anytime during your birthday month.  I would recommend making a reservation as they are normally busy and it takes awhile to eat. But this is a great place to go for a special occasion.$LABEL$5
It all depends on the chef who is performing for you . I have been here twice in last several months and felt everything was average . I have seen other chefs in different restaurants and they have put on a much better show .$LABEL$3
The atmosphere was fun. Our chef was very nice and entertaining. The filet was excellent.  Their salad dressing is a little harsh for my taste.  Over all it was a great time. I will definitely go back.$LABEL$5
Benihana.  It's just rolls off the tongue$LABEL$1
I have to admit$LABEL$2
Only complaint was when we arrived we were basically told we had to wait for another party to arrive prior to being seated.  Was told we could go to bar---after saying no we wanted to be seated they agreed.  We made reservations for 3 and had no idea who other party was so why could we not be seated---we were not asking to be served.  Over all experience was nice.  Waitress very nice and attentive and so was Chef.$LABEL$3
Love the food$LABEL$4
Ok. It started out as a rough night . 40 minutes late honoring our reservation$LABEL$3
Benihana is by far our favorite steak and seafood place in the area. The food is so fresh. The chefs are great. The wait staff is excellent.  If you're looking for shrimp flying and loud chefs singing obnoxious songs then this is not for you. If you want a friendly  atmosphere and delicious food then this is your place. The sushi is fresh and tasty. The quality of food is obviously there.$LABEL$5
Many great memories and great experience at Benihana BUT last night WAS NOT! Horrible service! Took 15 mins to even take a drink order...then when I had a question about a speciality wine the waiter says he didn't know so ok no big deal$LABEL$1
This is by the far the worst hibachi restaurant I have eaten at. The food is very bland from the onion soup to the fried rice (which basically was white rice with chopped onions) to the chicken (which was so pale it looked like it was boiled). Hibachi food typically has tons of flavor and tastes good because it has some grill marks and char$LABEL$1
This place is crappy the only veggies u get is onions and zucchinis took the server 30 min to serv us drinks then took them 20 min to take orders by the time the chef comes out already an hour just for the food and the show after we ate our waiter didnt even recommend anny desserts just gave us the chek and leave with out saying anny thing els o i for got we were still eating like wtf im still eating and so was mi family and u just give me the check the chef just left like five min ago . I recamen go sime where els n eat$LABEL$1
This is the WORST Hibachi I have ever had.  We came here for a friends birthday$LABEL$1
Benihana has always been one of my favorite Hibachi places$LABEL$3
We celebrated my daughter's 12th Birthday at Benihana on 10/16/14.  The food was delicious and the chef was very talented and entertaining!  He did things with the food on the Hibachi we hadn't seen before...a big heart made out of fried rice and made it \""beat\"" using the spatula.       The only negative was when it came time for them to sing Happy Birthday our waitress was the only one around so our poor waitress was stuck doing the birthday songs by herselfSo we joined in to help her.  No wonder our waitress seemed so unhappy with her job.    I was happy that we had the option of brown rice and not just white or fried rice.$LABEL$4
This place has the weirdest entrance ever. Just be prepared. Came for my sons 5th birthday last night. He's a little foodie. The restaurant itself is nice and we were seated pretty quickly.  Our waitress showed up 2 seconds later to take drink orders and appetizer/sushi orders. I just asked for water and some time to actually look at the menu. several min later out waitress came back with drinks and asked to take orders. I ordered chicken and steak along with a cranberry mojito. Quickly after taking orders our waitress brought out our soup. I liked it but it lacked salt. Before I even finished the salad course came out. I was able to enjoy both before the chef came out to prepare our meal. What did bother me was all the dishes in our area. I can't stand a dirty table and I wish our waitress would have removed them sooner. Our chef Penny wasn't the best hibachi chef I've seen but she was great with my son and he really enjoyed watching her. She was honestly a lot of fun. The hibachi itself was pretty good. I liked the fried rice which is an up charge. The steak was good and so was the chicken. I honestly don't think it was anything special. Dessert was ice cream also nothing special. So to sum it up our waitress seemed overwhelmed and managed to make me feel rushed even though I feel she could have visited our table a few more times then she did. That along with being overpriced is why only the 3 stars.$LABEL$3
The only reason I wouldn't rate this place any higher than a 3 is that it can be a hit or miss. This time was great! FOOD: I ordered the chopper steak salad$LABEL$3
If you're a hardcore fan of authentic Mexican food$LABEL$3
I read a few of the reviews of Mad Mex and quite a few reviewers called their food Tex Mex and I don't see it that way. I see Mad Mex as more Cali Mex with the accent being on fresh ingredients$LABEL$4
Perhaps our mistake was going on a Sat.night in the summer .Who knew it would be packed to the gills with thirsty college students. Loud is an understatement. We were crammed into a little table the four of us elbow to elbow with the diners seated on both sides. This already has put me in a bad mood.I never did well in Europe sharing my table with stranger and in the U.S it irks me even more It took forever to get our drinks of simply water and soda. We at last caught our waitresses eye and was told should would take care of us she guessed.....? What the heck she was the same waitress who took the drink order and was delivering the food next to us. When Ms.Wiffty finally brought our long awaited food it is totally the wrong order.We even considered asking if we could just keep it because we had waited so long$LABEL$2
Love their spicy black bean dip and their black bean and pineapple quesadilla... mmmm can't get enough of their black bean.$LABEL$5
Do they still do the half-price late night menu here?  That used to be clutch.  Margaritas are solid and the food is good. They actually steam their burritos$LABEL$3
Not a pleasant experience.  While looking at the menu$LABEL$2
\""Meh.  I've experience better.\"" I find this fairly overpriced for the quality of food.  I think that the decor of the place and the witty menu drive up the \""like\"" of this place b/c it's modern and fun... but it all comes down to the food$LABEL$2
You have no idea how badly I WANT to like this place. They are incredibly vegetarian/vegan-friendly. I just haven't been impressed by anything I've ordered there. Even the chips and salsa aren't terribly good. I do like the bar-- they have great sangria-- but that's about it.$LABEL$2
The food here is pretty good but the service was some of the worst I've ever experienced. Our wait just to place drink orders was almost 15 minutes$LABEL$2
When I was living in Wheeling WV$LABEL$4
We went to the Mad Mex in Cranberry Twp and won't make the mistake of going back. The food was horribly hot$LABEL$1
Wonderful ambiance and great selection of brews and food. Absolutely love the the tofu tacos and pineapple habanero salsa.The stars are for the food and ambiance only. We dined here twice on our trip to Pittsburgh. The first time$LABEL$3
Always great service at the bar from Tanya and Nikki. Great food and wide selection of draft beers. One of my favorite spots.$LABEL$5
I love this restaurant and I probably go about once a month; however$LABEL$4
Burritos are huge! Margaritas are good$LABEL$4
This place is hard to find in this crazy plaza$LABEL$4
I took my niece here last week for lunch and we enjoyed our food.  The guac was really good.  They gave us a lot$LABEL$3
This place is okay. The waiter was horrible and barely checked on us. The food was also not too good. It was very bland and didn't have a lot of taste to it. I will not be coming back.$LABEL$2
This afternoon I took my 4 year old to this mad mex for lunch after a great morning swimming and doing a yoga class.  We had to send back our food because the chicken was stone cold (even though surrounded by sizzling veggies on a skillet).  It seemed like it was yeterday's chicken.  They brought out fresh food and I'm kicking myself for having eaten it.  The rest of our day has been spent cleaning up food poisoning accidents and in the bathroom.$LABEL$1
The food isn't terrible$LABEL$2
I eat here a lot (like at least once a week$LABEL$3
I love me some Mad Mex but$LABEL$4
While I LOVE Mad Mex$LABEL$1
I think its time to sacrifice time and convenience. When we visit the area....this place always lacks the experience that we receive from ShadySide$LABEL$2
I'm in from out of town$LABEL$2
I love kitchen stores$LABEL$4
I attended the sushi class on Monday night.  The instructors were great:  friendly$LABEL$2
Crouse's beer distributor is a good$LABEL$4
A very oddly laid out supermarket. the Deli isle is not very wide$LABEL$2
Dirty and small.  Not laid out well.  Expired items on the shelves.  Rude cashiers.  Self check out usually broken.  Horrible experience more than once.  I don't shop here unless I have to.$LABEL$1
The worst pulled pork sandwich I have ever had.    Their watermelon mixed drink was very good though.  I won't be returning.$LABEL$1
The sundae bar is a big hit with my kids$LABEL$3
What's better than fresh$LABEL$3
Obviously$LABEL$1
good burgers and soup!!!$LABEL$4
Had a beer and an appetizer$LABEL$2
Stopped for dinner there while traveling on business.  Greeted by a friendly hostess$LABEL$1
Went there on my first day in Pittsburg. Wasn't the best experience. My waitress was to busy talking to her coworkers that she couldn't even give us any sauces. The food was ok but nothing to great. When I go back to Pittsburg I will not be going there again!!!!$LABEL$1
Not up to it's previous brunch standards. Buffet has scaled back in variety and quality.   Still good but no longer excellent.$LABEL$2
We went to this location$LABEL$3
There's really absolutely nothing special about Max & Erma's. In fact I would say it's probably about the most boring chain restaurant out there. No wait$LABEL$2
Absolutely horrible service$LABEL$1
I have been to this place many many times over the years. But the last visit was at least a year prior. I was shocked by the outside condition of the restaurant. This place definitely looks like it's falling apart on the outside. I didn't stay there to eat$LABEL$3
Food is what you would expect from a BB$LABEL$3
Received bad service today.  Got the wrong chase for my sandwich$LABEL$2
Frequently get take out from this place. Food usually fairly decent. Except we found some type of flying bug in the bottom of our rice container. Called to complain and they offered 20% off our next bill and did not sound surprised by our find. Considering the money we have spent there over the years I was highly upset. But they seemed to care less. Guess I have to drive to sesame next time.$LABEL$1
Consumer alert... rats!$LABEL$1
This Starbucks is in a strip mall at the bottom of Greentree hill and unfortunately has the unlucky fortune of being a hangout for the most obnoxious group of men who come into the store early in the morning$LABEL$2
This Starbucks is right down the street from my parents house. It's gotta be my favourite location in the Pittsburgh area. I read Joe D's review and laughed a bit. He's right...there are some guys who sit in there$LABEL$5
I've been coming here ever since I can remember. The Baristas seem genuinely interested in your well-being. They all have great personalities and are a joy to talk to when I come in. Dan$LABEL$5
Panera does a nice job on some items.  Stopped to have lunch with a friend who wanted to use the WiFi and get a bite to eat.  Kind of a soup type day$LABEL$3
I know a lot of people tend to either love or hate Panera; I happen to love it - the You-Pick-2 combo is one of my favorite lunch options. And as luck (good or bad depending on how my diet's going!) would have it$LABEL$5
Oh$LABEL$4
I used to love Panera but as the years have gone by their standards of both food and service has declined greatly. It's a gamble if you are going to get good food and service or if the D team is working that day and they serve cold soup and sandwiches that look like Stevie Wonder  made them. I have to be deserate now to go there$LABEL$2
I wish more chains had great quality foods and ambience rich environments. I thoroughly enjoyed my roasted turkey$LABEL$4
Ya Gotta Regatta! It's Pittsburgh's mid summer July 4th celebration. Once it was the largest inland regatta in the nation with an average 1 Million people visiting for the four day event. Scaled back these days for reasons I won't get into$LABEL$3
Once enjoying my crisp cool water. Our orders were taken promptly$LABEL$4
When trying to think of where to go for a steak dinner The Greentree Inn came to mind. I had never been here in all the years of living so very close. I was glad I chose this establishment. Food was excellent and I loved the feel of the place$LABEL$4
After a long enduring 12 plus hour trip to Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
Nice$LABEL$4
Service wasn't very good$LABEL$2
I'm usually in Pittsburgh once a year and each time I come to town I typically have Vincents. Their NY Style thin crust pizza is just awesome and the service is typically pretty good. Regular crust is good as well if you want  something a little bit thicker.$LABEL$4
Have mixed Vincent's.  My meal was good (spicy pasta) but service was spotty.  Another in the party had the homemade gnocchi and it was not good at all$LABEL$2
Who knew french fries came on salads? Pittsburgh did.Salads are good. Pizza looked tasty. Service is helpful (when you can find it).The pepper steak salad is pretty good - get it with ranch. Or instead$LABEL$4
Not a bad place to grab a bite for lunch. Their service can be kind of slow so dont plan on having a quick in and out lunch.Greentree does not have many options for food$LABEL$3
The inside of Vincent's has the distinct smell of wall-to-wall carpets and fried food - not necessarily 'bad$LABEL$3
Overpriced$LABEL$2
Expensive$LABEL$3
Food is mediocre service is lousy. I'm sitting here right now and have been out of water and done eating for 20 min...$LABEL$2
Service was good but probably the worse pizza I've ever had.  We couldn't eat it.$LABEL$2
I went for dinner July 10.  Tight quarters inside but nice outside covered porch..Small inviting bar. Parking lot is full of potholes. It wont take much to fill with small stones but nothing has been done for years. It would be nice for customers to the fill potholes. Friendly staff . I ordered a Italian Hoagie and my wife had Spinach Ravoli. Waitress was nice but never asked to refill our drinks. My hoagie was dry with min meat. Bun was OK. My wife liked her salad. Both was very avg food in tight spaces and service could have been more attentive. Probably wont go back.$LABEL$2
Just moved to the area so I am looking for a go to spot. Vincents isn't going to be it. The food wasn't great it was just ok. I had the italian sausage. The prices are reasonable and I got my food in a timely manner but no personal customer service. I sat at the bar and literally no attempt to have any dialogue except get my order. No other options ill go back but that's it. Or I may try pizza and have it delivered.$LABEL$3
We stumbled on this place on a Friday night. The place was moderately busy$LABEL$3
Great old-school donut shop with delicious donuts.  The even still tie up the boxes.$LABEL$5
HOLY MOTHER OF DONUTS! This place is amazing. My daughter and I stop every Friday morning$LABEL$5
The old fashioned sour cream... bavarian filled... glazed and cake... OMG so good. Seriously$LABEL$5
A while back my Mom bought some donuts from here and they were really stale by the next day.  She called and mentioned something about it to them and they didn't even seem to care.  I like to try and support local business but with an attitude like they showed I have no use for them.  Doesn't seem to be any real set hours so you never know when they will be open.$LABEL$1
The Pennsylvania Turnpike caught me on a good day. That is$LABEL$3
So how can you write a review for the turnpike? Everyone hates it...and unfortunately I drive it frequently. Word of the wise...drive this road in the daytime$LABEL$2
Darren's recent review of Kmart got me thinking about this place. I was out this way recently and I stopped to look for a place to eat. Man$LABEL$1
What a depressing shell of a mall... I remember when it was *the* mall to go to... CompUSA$LABEL$1
Truly the worst mall in America.  Going here is like being in a time machine though.  There is a store called \""90's Nails\"" for goodness sakes.How is this place even still standing?  For one$LABEL$1
Honestly I don't consider this place a mall. I consider it to be the entryway I have to use to get into K-Mart. Sadly there are a few stores left still lingering around but hey$LABEL$1
Oy vey! Stay away$LABEL$1
I certainly have stayed in worse places$LABEL$2
Not a bad place$LABEL$3
My husband and I stayed at the Best Western Parkway Center Inn for a U2 Concert at Heinz Field. We realized that the room was going to be extremely small based on the reviews$LABEL$3
We stayed here in an effort to cut costs (being competitors$LABEL$4
The rooms are laid out weird$LABEL$2
Yeah$LABEL$3
I hate Olive Garden. It makes me laugh when they ask \""how is everything?\""  I wonder what goes through their minds when I say \""The microwave did an awesome job\"". I'm in town for a few days$LABEL$2
The service was great while we were here. The food was average. And the parking was bad.$LABEL$4
I normally don't like chain restaurants$LABEL$3
I ordered food that I believed was gluten free.  Within twenty minutes I started to have symptoms and was sick for two days.  I believe that my food may have been gluten free but that cross contamination caused my problem.  I had the same experience at another Pittsburgh Olive Garden restaurant and so am concluding that they may not be careful with cross contamination.$LABEL$1
Avoid at all costs!  They diluted my wine with water$LABEL$1
Being born and raised into an all Italian family$LABEL$2
Ten minute wait and easily most tables are open!!! Surprise it's lunch time!!!! I just passed six tables empty and clean. Beyond me...$LABEL$1
Although I walked in with some hesitation (after a less than great stay at a Holiday in Columbus$LABEL$4
Beautiful hotel exterior and lobby. clean$LABEL$4
Hotel itself is adequate.  The 2 stars are for the hotel's internet connection.  I've stayed here twice in one week and both times were frustrating in terms of the Wi Fi. The connection drops numerous times in one session and connecting can be a chore. In terms of smartphones$LABEL$2
I was perfectly a-ok with this place*.  My friend's mother had suggested we not stay here$LABEL$3
This used to be the Holiday Inn and now it is the Clarion Hotel & Conference Center.  We needed to find a place not too far from Heinz Stadium for a reasonable price. We paid about $90 per night for this place$LABEL$1
oh. dear. lord. i feel so bad for the tour group from japan that was here .... this place is the dumps.  we had 2 rooms: they were supposed to be on the same floor.  nope. 2 different floors$LABEL$2
Place is ok but a little uncomfortable. There's water damage in some corners of the the ceiling and it looks pretty creepy. There are stains on the walls and ironing board but$LABEL$2
Umm lol so seriously I read some reviews about this place and was like NOOOO it can't be that bad. HA HA....DUDE! So this spot is like mad cheap but REALLY? First we check in and notice the are undergoing some much needed renovations. Checkin was seamless as it should be. We get to out room #122 and after reading the reviews I know to check the beds immediately. The first bed legit has hair under the sheets...strike 1. As I'm pulling the covers back on the second bed I find two quarters...that's right folks! Obviously left by the last guest intentionally to warn the next occupants that the SHEETS HAVEN'T BEEN CHANGED...let alone checked. I mean really? You couldn't at lease have made it look like you did your jobs?We go to the desk and make them aware of the issue. They apologetically get us another room. This room is better its evident by the way these beds were made that the room has been cleaned. The elevator by the desk is stuck on the 3rd floor lol death trap so we take the stairs. Thank God for yelp....You've all been warned lol SERIOUSLY!$LABEL$1
I was fine with staying here for the short time I was in Pittsburgh. The only thing that really bothered me$LABEL$3
This was technically the Clarion hotel so I think the name is wrong on the page. I'd like to start by saying that I'm not much of a complainer$LABEL$1
We rented two rooms$LABEL$3
we checked out 4 rooms just to see what it was like$LABEL$1
Nightmare.  It's a ghost town. Needles in parking lot. \""Lobby\"" is a hotel room with undesirables hanging around. Asked to see our rooms before checking in$LABEL$1
I'm not sure I can even give this place one star. To be fair$LABEL$1
Ah$LABEL$1
This was by far the worst hotel experience I've ever had. It wasn't just that there was MASSIVE construction going on$LABEL$1
Wish I could give this place negative stars. Where to begin? It begins with no signs saying where the hotel is at. And then it goes into their \""temporary lobby\"" which is a room turned into an office. The whole place is under construction which wouldn't be so bad$LABEL$1
What can I say about this place ? I have had several good experiences and several bad experiences here over the years .  All and all$LABEL$3
Really good bagels.  Stopped for a bagel and tea.  Place was crowded but the line moved quickly.  Had a Good Grains bagel with some cream cheese shmear.  Delicious.  Love the green iced tea!.This place is tiny but most get it and go...no not get go! lolHave had soup and bagel sandwich in the past and it was very enjoyable.$LABEL$3
I am always in Heaven when I go to Ithaca New York$LABEL$3
What a crock!   The thin bagel (with asparagus/mushrooms$LABEL$1
I stopped here yesterday morning because I was attending an off-site training session.  Typical Starbucks.  On the way back$LABEL$2
The barista was super sweet. I told her I wanted something new and she was a fountain of information. She made a lot of great suggestions and I told her to wing it. She went with a Caramel Brulee with two pumps of White Mocha. She also gave me a discount$LABEL$5
Worst effin Starbucks on the block and their baristas suck at making drinks. Horrible customer service and they ALWAYS screw up our orders. I just don't understand why they're so lazy. I understand their comprehension level is low because of the lack of education though. But$LABEL$1
Came here for a \""quick\"" breakfast on our way from the hotel to Fallingwater$LABEL$1
Not exactly a fan of this location$LABEL$2
MARKET SQUARE.....The slowest$LABEL$2
I wish someone had written a review for this place so that I would have not gone to it.  As a matter of background$LABEL$2
regarding Shari's review: when i went they wouldnt even accept my debit card .  she was an older woman who i do not think knew how to use the machine so i ended up going across the street to pnc and using the atm.  it is not top quality work$LABEL$2
I guess this will be my last good review for Princess nails. Unfortunately the worst possible thing has happened. I have one eyebrow! Its slowly growing back but the idea of having to pencil in my eyebrow everyday is starting to get to me. Unfortunately I don't know what happened? Michelle are you going blind? Are you okay? Obviously you left me with completely a mishapen eyebrows which I had to have someone else fix because you botched mine. I cried$LABEL$1
By far the worst Shellac manicure I have ever had. I went down on my lunch break for a quick mani. First the woman rushed through my \""manicure.\"" I'm not sure they have any type of sanitizer for their instruments as she kept pulling things out of her drawer. The manicure was very quick and not at all thorough. Once she started to paint my nails she kept having to fix them because she was in a such a rush. She took off polish that was on the nail and then pushed my hand into the UV dryer. When she went to put the top coat on my Shellac she put the Foundation coat on 2 of my nails before she realized and wouldn't fix them saying they will be fine. During the entire process she did about 6 eyebrow waxes and then would forget where she was in my process. She also kept forgetting to turn on the UV dryer to the point where she walked away and I had to turn it on.Do not go here. If I could give it 0 stars I would.$LABEL$1
Adequate and could be best in the area$LABEL$3
The only reason I like this Salon is because I've finally found a stylist that cuts my hair okay$LABEL$4
I got a good haircut here a few months ago$LABEL$1
I$LABEL$2
This is the first place in Pittsburgh that has gotten my hair right. They were courteous$LABEL$5
Very$LABEL$5
1st time here. Got my hair did tonight! I'm an oxymoron I work in cosmetics$LABEL$5
The salon is nice$LABEL$2
Being new to the city$LABEL$5
First haircut in pittsburgh$LABEL$5
So...I was sold on MCN Salon about a year ago$LABEL$2
Excellent Salon.  I went to Kara for curly hair as Nicolette was not available (this was my first visit:  I recently moved to PGH and used these Yelp reviews to help me pick).  She was perfect:  friendly$LABEL$4
I booked a hair apt here after reading some of the reviews on Yelp$LABEL$2
so i went here to be a hair model for a coloring class and was so impressed! my stylist$LABEL$5
Newly relocated to Pittsburgh's east end from Miami$LABEL$4
I have been going to MCN salon for over 3 years now.  Since moving to the east end in 2008$LABEL$5
I've been going to MCN salon for a few years now$LABEL$5
I had an ok experience at MCN Studio.  I just moved to PIttsburgh from NYC and I relied on yelp to choose my hair salon.  I called MCN and asked to be seen by a senior stylist and the receptionist recommended Ashley.  I booked her for a cut and full highlight.  When I got there$LABEL$3
I'm in search for the best stylist when it comes to curly hair. Here's is where I met the charming Kara last week$LABEL$4
Me and my wife went to the salon for the first time for our haircuts$LABEL$3
Ok so after coming here since March I finally feel ready to review. I started coming to MCN after I had my hair colored and cut by someone who absolutely destroyed my hair. I had asked for an ombr\u00e9 and ended up with a poop brown and bleach blonde wreck. The next morning I called MCN praying they could fit me on for a corrective color. They got me in with Leslee that afternoon.  I have linked some pictures but I don't know if they do her work justice. I went from having patches of bleached hair to the long ombr\u00e9 that I'd hoped for. Leslee spent hours on my hair color. It involved dying the roots the correct color$LABEL$5
I go with three stars because the co-owner$LABEL$3
So I was walking around downtown wanting to find a place that does Shellac nails. I tried looking on Yelp to identify if any salons downtown offer it$LABEL$4
I mean...seriously? I should have known better given that it only had one positive review. My 600th yelp review$LABEL$2
I have been sitting here looking at the poor quality of my shellac manicure and I just had to write. I walked in to Kenny's nail salon this afternoon and was pleased that there wasn't a wait. They also provided very friendly customer service.However$LABEL$1
Very sloppy! No attention the polish is all over my fingers so disappointing and aggravating that now I'm going to have to pay more money else where to get them redone$LABEL$1
They suck!! First of all not even 24 hours after I got acrylics one broke$LABEL$1
The worst experience ever. I have never complained about my nails bc im pretty laid back but this was insane. The man that was doing my nails had an incredibly shaky hands$LABEL$1
Lots of LCD HD Screens make this a good place to check out a game. The atmosphere is a little bland$LABEL$3
I really like SoHo.  First off$LABEL$5
Went here with a couple friends during a conference across the river. Service was typical for a this style restaurant$LABEL$3
Just above bar food but fine in a pinch.$LABEL$3
Hotel restaurant/bars are usually not known for being the best in town.  So when I had the opportunity to eat and drink at SoHo recently$LABEL$2
SoHo is always a great place to start out at before heading to a Pirates game$LABEL$4
Another lunch spot for the northshore.  This probably has the best food.  The french dip and the wraps are very good.  It's a tad pricey but not horrible.  They're really good for pickup.  As is a constant problem on the northshore$LABEL$3
SoHo clearly relies on the Pirates crowd across the street$LABEL$2
Soho is very So-So.  Restaurants.com had a coupon for buy $25 for $10.  I snagged it but the conditions were annoying- spend $45 to get the $25 and no alcohol is included.  BOO!Anyways$LABEL$3
A number of the reviews here giving off the \""eh\"" vibe? That's because Soho is a kind of \""eh\"" place.I visited for the first time yesterday evening. My boyfriend and I decided to stroll over the bridge to catch some Jazz Live in Katz Plaza (Roger Humphries - really good show) and then headed to North Shore for some grub. Now$LABEL$2
Stopped in for lunch before a Bucs game. Great service and food.  Hamburger was thick and juicy cooked perfectly.  Service is excellent.  I can highly recommend SoHo as your pre Bucco stop.$LABEL$4
SoHo Pittsburgh. Not SoHo NYC.  Was staying in adjoining Marriott property. Food was pleasant as was the service. Waiter was honest about the mediocre food. Crab cakes have too much filler. coworker had pork chop (seemed smaller than advertised. Dumplings were good. Wings looked okay. One at of our group had the french dip sandwich and liked it.  Deserts were pretty good.  Come with the proper expectations and you will be satisfied.$LABEL$3
Went here to watch the College National Champ game.  Was not as crowded as you would think but it was a Monday.  I didn't eat here.  Had a few drinks is all.  Cool place to hang out.  Would like to go here again$LABEL$3
If 2-stars means \""meh$LABEL$3
We we're not impressed. The prices are high for what is bar food with no real uptake.Service was neutral both visits (stayed in attached hotel).Would be willing to grab a cocktail but definitely better options around.$LABEL$2
I wish i could give this place no stars! we sat for lunch after a lunch rush there were 2 other table in the restaurant besides ours$LABEL$1
Nice looking place and the worst service i've had in the last 20 years.   After waiting 10 minutes to have a bartender at a less than half full bar acknowledge us we then ordered and the drinks arrived.  Hope you only need one round because after waiting 30 minutes to try to order a second round we paid with exact change to save us from wasting another hours of our life.   It is hard to explain how oblivious the bar tenders were.$LABEL$1
Soho was disappointing. Lunch was very crowded$LABEL$2
Very good bar in Pittsburgh's North Shore. Nice draft and bottle beer selection. Had a Pittsburgh salad and burger. Both first rate! Great service and a lively atmosphere full of friendly customers enjoying themselves. Full menu including steaks$LABEL$4
Bar next to stadiumTypicalbar next to stadium placeWaitresses def looking for other jobs Not happy at allThis isn't even a game night$LABEL$2
We were looking for food late night on Thursday and nothing was open.  Since we were staying at spring hill suites we thought we'd give it a try. We were afraid it would be expensive. Flipped menu to sandwiches.  Had a burger or turkey burger or hot dog or chicken sandwich with side for $9-10.We thought that was good and we had no other late night options.  Food came out hot and fresh. My chicken sandwich was grilled nicely with plenty of juice left in. Homemade chips as side.Place was large and clean. Pirates out of town so we walked right in at 10am on a Thursday night. Full bar but we didn't order anything.$LABEL$4
No redeeming qualities here. Schwill on tap. Food was terrible - had the pizza$LABEL$1
I came here awhile back for lunch after kayaking for a couple of hours.  I ordered the Pittsburgh salad$LABEL$3
Good food but takes too long before game to get order$LABEL$3
Meh. I always hope for the best. I did not$LABEL$2
Had the chicken sandwich$LABEL$2
We stayed at the Spring Hill Suites next door to this place$LABEL$3
Just walking around the area and ran into this place.  Nice big screen tv's and lots of people.....not over crowded$LABEL$3
Stayed @ the hotel. Ordered sirloin steaks. No steak knife$LABEL$1
Good restaurant with a diverse menu$LABEL$4
In the Wesin Hotel$LABEL$3
LUNCH:  This was one of my favorite lunch spots when I lived and worked in Pittsburgh. I was a creature of habit though - - for lunch I very seldom strayed from their wonderful lobster bisque and a nice mixed green salad. It was the perfect lunch. Served quickly$LABEL$5
I have been going to this place for years.  It has excellent sushi and a pretty good selection$LABEL$3
the salads are quite exceptional$LABEL$3
Surprisingly (or not)$LABEL$4
Attached to the Westin Convention Center$LABEL$3
I got the slow roasted jerk chicken (yes I know at the fish market!) and it was very very good.  For dessert I split the 'doughnut' with ice cream which was very tasty.$LABEL$3
From March 2013 visit: the food was much better$LABEL$4
located in the westin hotel downtown pittsburgh$LABEL$3
Serviceable \""upscale\"" chain seafood spot$LABEL$2
One in our party summed it all up:  \""When you're paying these prices$LABEL$2
Had dinner here and it was located in my hotel (Westin). Enjoyed a Lobster Bisque and a Green Curry Cod. The service was a little slow but friendly. My fish had several bones in it. The bread was sourdough with a shrimp butter. I think it was a bit pricey for a seafood restaurant. I didn't try the sushi that everyone was raving about. Where does a restaurant in Pittsburgh acquire fresh fish for sushi?$LABEL$3
- The bread was good and so was the spicy shrimp butter that came with it.- The lobster bisque had a very slight gummy texture to it$LABEL$2
Terrible.I visited this restaurant for the first time yesterday to use up a Groupon.  Thank God I didn't pay full price for this slop.  First$LABEL$1
I have eaten there several times.  This is an overpriced overhyped seafood restaurant.  The portions are not worth the price.  The Sushi is average at best.  The service has been poor almost every time I went.  We complained once to the manager and in the middle of talking to her she picked up the phone and totally forgot she was talking to us.  The salads are small and nothing to write about.  The decor needs to be updated. If you ask me why I keep going back; it's not by my choice.  Usually we have several people staying at the Westin.$LABEL$2
Came in for drinks after a conference and could not get service. Finally went searching for someone$LABEL$2
Pittsburgh has good food.  Don't waste your time at the Fish Market.I stay in the Westin often and have had three meals at this spot in the past week.  The first was fine enough to get me to come back for a second trip.  The second time$LABEL$2
I have never had such awful$LABEL$1
We were staying at the Westin and it was late and the Original Fish Market was right on site. Well the experience at both the hotel and the restaurant was dismal. We waited too long to be seated and the hosted seemed to have attitude when we asked one of the servers to find her. A simple \""Sorry for the wait\"" would have been nice. We were about to leave after waiting 15 mins for a waiter. Unfortunately we did not.  The food was all bland and tasteless. Oh! Except for the bold taste of Obay on the fries. I had blackened rainbow trout.  I expected a bold favors but yet nothing. It was not even blackened.  Looked like paprika for color$LABEL$1
My experience may different from others because I am an attractive female who went in with 3 young African American males.  Good friends of mine who spent a helluva a lot of money in Pittsburgh that weekend - who work hard and expect good service for good money like everyone else.  We were greeted with reserved distant service.  The waiter said something nervously like \""It's all good$LABEL$2
Sushi was great.  Everyone I was with enjoyed their meal.  I will probably not go back because the location is not great.$LABEL$3
Terrible crab bisque. My husband liked the fish stew though.  It had lots of beans$LABEL$1
Literally the worst restaurant experience that I've ever had$LABEL$1
One of the only places open downtown after 10 pm mid-week. Terrible service$LABEL$2
Had the Walu (Hawaiian butterfish)$LABEL$3
This place really should be much higher quality for first the prices and second the only food option at the Westin.  I stopped by here two nights ago on a work trip to grab some food.  The wine that I ordered was out (which was fine) and substituted - but for a place with a giant wine cellar I wouldn't suspect that should be an issue for the glass wines.When I went to order I asked the server how the scallops were - and asked her to be honest.  She said that they are the most well done in Pittsburgh.  Well I think she meant that literally because the scallops were as tough as a tire and there presentation was poor with a pile of over salty spinach and some kinds of blobs smeared around the plate.  I was a little bummed about my experience when the 55 dollar bill came for one entree and a glass of wine.Also a one off thing but the overhead light on the table was like a 10K watt surgical spotlight.  It actually hurt my eyes to look at the table it was so bright.  That should be an easy adjustment for the management.  Food quality on the other hand - you need a new chef.$LABEL$1
Walking around downtown we stumbled into this place for a quick dinner.  It was fairly empty and quiet (nice)$LABEL$3
I've been meaning to go back to the Fish Market for so long. I remember the great crab legs I had years ago. I finally had the chance last week and was surprisingly disappointed.The service was great. We sat at the bar and in no time both bartenders greeted us with smiles and menus. I guess my main concern was the food quality. I ordered the beet salad with warm goat cheese (was not warm at all) and shrimp and scallop linguine. Both were not unique in flavor or presentation. It was as if I made it in my own kitchen. My boyfriend enjoyed his lobster bisque and his seafood jambalya that was perfectly spicy.I do applaud the venue for offering a diverse and affordable wine list. And$LABEL$2
Was a little hesitant to eat here because of the average to below average reviews. But it was in our hotel and we were famished.But we were pleasantly surprised by our meals that were extremely delicious. I got the Waluu/Butterfish (highly recommend this$LABEL$5
I was pretty disappointed by this experience. And I usually avoid hotel restaurants for this very reason$LABEL$2
I haven't had a full meal here but I had one of the best drink's of my life... The Sapphire Collins and it was amazing. That is coming from a non Gin drinker$LABEL$3
Was able to go in without a wait. Part of the Westin Hotel$LABEL$3
Surprised by the poor reviews here. Yes$LABEL$3
I was one of three women who ate here on a Thursday night while here for business.  We got seated right away$LABEL$3
Have you ever eaten in a place where the whole seems far less than the sum of its parts?  Believe me$LABEL$2
First time I've eaten here I went during lunch time. Not crowded but service was quite slow so I took off a star. My girlfriend ordered from their sushi lunch special and I ordered the bison burger. You're probably asking why order that when at a fish market. Well I originally planned on fish but I hadn't had bison in a while and it caught my eye. Well the menu is a bit pricey and I don't mind paying for good food so I had high expectations. He bison burger was mediocre (took a star away) The menu said bacon$LABEL$2
Confusing! No one to greet me so I wasn't sure if I should go to the regular the bar or the sushi bar. I chose e sushi bar based on the number of available seat-all of them. I waited for eye contact with one of the sushi preparers. Obtained we contact after an extended period of time. He gave me a menu and instructions. But I Asked about process since I wanted a cocktail as well. Waiter will be there shortly. And he was! Cocktail order submitted$LABEL$3
DIDN'T EAT HERE...this review not about the food.  We went on Friday night around 8pm$LABEL$1
I've been to the Fish Market many$LABEL$2
McCormick & Schmick's knockoff is the best way to describe this completely non-memorable place. I agree with the other person who said \""it's trying to be a swanky hotel bar/restaurant\"". That may sound dumb but as someone who frequents hotels & their restaurants it can easily go either way. I've found you can get a great read on a place by the vibe of a hotel lounge. I hope for Pittsburgh this is not the case. Did I expect more from a Westin? Yes. Am I surprised? No.Sub-par sushi. Tasted like takeout from Wegmans (holler$LABEL$2
Stopped in for lunch. No greeter so we weren't sure where to go. Super expensive for the portions. My salad had dressing only in the center. The rest was dry. My sweet potato fries that came with breaded shrimp tasted BBQ-ish  weird. But the worst was that my breaded shrimp actually had a curly hair cooked into the bread ing. It was disgusting. The waitress apologized and offered to replace but my appetitive was gone by then. She however did not offer to comp the meal. I would absolutely not return nor recommend it to anyone. Way too overpriced and the hair was a disgusting unwanted bonus :-($LABEL$1
High end seafood attached to a high end hotel. I liked the large bar area where I had lunch. Tried the fish (Cod) sandwich that was fresh and high quality. Great service too. I would return again when in town for any reason.$LABEL$5
I am sorry to have to give the Original Fish Market a 2 rating$LABEL$2
Not good. I suspect the servers are over worked or spread too thin b/c the service sucked. The food was ok$LABEL$1
We checked this out for lunch$LABEL$2
We had our reception at The Pennsylvanian in Pittsburgh. Opening Night Caterers was our first choice and we were not disappointed!! From the first meeting$LABEL$5
This is a happening joint for happy hour and beyond. I've walked by the huge windows while downtown before and been amazed at how many people were drinking it up inside. Friday night$LABEL$3
Went here on a Monday at around 7:00.  The bar was filled with the usual suspects; guys in Brioni suits drinking away the stress$LABEL$2
Good drinks with some run of the mill tapas. Nothing was innovative which I don't mind since it wasn't to expensive. My food taste a little burnt which is what cost it the fourth star. Overall it's worth trying and you may like it better than I did.$LABEL$3
SO disappointed with this place! I've been wanting to try it for some time and finally did and boy...what a letdown. I had heard that it was one of downtown's happening Happy Hour places$LABEL$2
This place is A-OK!  I was contemplating giving it 4 stars but the scene is getting a bit dated.  They need to spruce it up or something.  It's just sorta there now.  But don't get me wrong$LABEL$3
Never been before and went on a Thursday night at 6PM before a show. Upon arriving$LABEL$1
Girls looking for a sugar daddy$LABEL$2
I like it here...I've only visited in the past for happy hour or drinks out with friends. Recently$LABEL$4
This is a trendy \""Brazilian Tapas\"" restaurant nestled in the Cultural District. Perfect for grabbing a drink or light meal before or after a show.Boy and I popped into Bossa Nova before the ballet. We saw suits de-stressing from the week$LABEL$3
This rating is for the drinks only and atomosphere$LABEL$2
Extremely disappointed.    My wife and I walked into the restaurant to have the hostess tell us that is was open seating.   Okay$LABEL$1
I stopped in to Bossa Nova for a holiday party on a busy Friday night in December. Although the restaurant side looked empty$LABEL$3
Went to an event here. The meatballs were frozen meatballs. It was ok. I probably wouldn't go back to eat.$LABEL$3
I've been going to this bar randomly over the last 5 years. It's definitely gone downhill.My last experience here was when I was trying to plan a birthday party during happy hour on a Friday during the summer. When I called to reserve some space$LABEL$2
The menu was small and underwhelming. The flatbread pizza most likely came out of the box. They didn't have the sauces$LABEL$1
So I was returning back to the office after doing a site visit and I heard the dreaded \""Pow!  Thump-thump-thump\""!  So I pulled over$LABEL$3
First impression:The guys here were borderline rude to me when I dropped my car off. I thought I had talked to someone on the phone and made an arrangements. It turns out there are two Monro Muffler locations on Penn Ave and no employee at either shop thought to bring this up (then$LABEL$2
I was driving on a road trip from Ohio to Virginia and my parking brake light turned on while I was on the highway$LABEL$5
I had lunch here yesterday before the Pirates game with a few friends.  I have also been here a few times upstairs.  I really liked the fact that we had no problem getting a seat at the bar or a table.  I usually go to the bars on the North Shore prior to Pirates game$LABEL$3
Solid place to grab a martini and listen to some sub-par live music. Far from amazing but hey not everywhere is going to be right?$LABEL$3
I was there in November 2009$LABEL$4
Don't bother. We were kind of desperate to find a place that wasn't too pricy and close to our hotel on a Monday night. We saw this place$LABEL$2
Olive and Twist is a convenient and rather nice bar to visit if you're staying in the downtown area.  The huge beer list and so so martinis do their job well in attracting the suits and theater crowds in mass numbers.  Finding a seat can be a chore if you come at the wrong hour because no one ever leaves!  The food menu is your typical bar menu and is very well priced.  My party only got the nachos which were good.  Our bartender$LABEL$3
Sooo blacked out here thatWe heckled the guitarist.Not sorry. He sucked.$LABEL$4
I went here couple of month ago for late night drink. I was a little drunk when I went in here$LABEL$3
I only went here to have a few drinks$LABEL$2
I get it. It gets busy when you're a bartender/waitress sometimes. I've been there myself. But you can explain why things are late or why it takes nearly half an hour to pour a glass of wine without being incredibly rude and cold$LABEL$2
Bossa Nova's step-sister bar$LABEL$4
The genius of the \""Olive or Twist\"" name got us in the door here$LABEL$2
Went to this place for lunch. My wife order a wrap and I order a salad. Very nice food. The sweet potato fries are wonderful. My smoked duck break salad is wonderful too. Highly recommended.$LABEL$4
Found you on Yelp and weren't disappointed. Very friendly waitstaff and good food (bar fare). Yummy desserts. The acoustics downstairs were terrible. Exposed brick everywhere and no noise dampening.  Not the best place for an intimate dinner or quiet conversation on the weekend. But a young$LABEL$4
I ... don't know why I keep going back to Olive or Twist. Seriously$LABEL$1
In town on business and I always try to find places like this.  Wow$LABEL$2
The Partner In Cuisine (PIC) and I had an early dinner there recently thanks to Groupon and we were not disappointed.  Since we weren't sure what to get and were just generically hungry$LABEL$4
Try the sweet potato fries with a side of honey mustard instead of ketchup. Linda and the rest of the ladies at the bar are awesme.$LABEL$4
We were in Pittsburgh for one night and Olive or Twist was near our hotel.  There were many other restaurants$LABEL$1
I had a really mixed experience here. Took the bf for dinner here before a show at Heinz Hall$LABEL$3
I love Olive or Twist. Absolutely love it. As I'm sure everyone who has been here has mentioned$LABEL$4
I've actually had OK experiences at this place in the past but this trip was especially bad. I tried to stop here with my husband for an appetizer and a drink before heading into the theater district - bad move.  Upon being seated the server explained that they were no longer serving food because of a water leak or something unsanitary-sounding. Klassy. For reasons I truly can't explain$LABEL$1
Girls night had to happen. We decided to go to Olive or Twist$LABEL$4
Owner or manager was very rude when we presented our yelp deal.$LABEL$1
A beautiful little bar with an exciting \""martini\"" list - do step outside your comfort zone and try one of the crafted drinks.$LABEL$5
This is the perfect place to go before a show downtown. I love the atmosphere of the restaurant in particular the upstairs space. It has a lofty$LABEL$3
Great atmosphere$LABEL$4
This place is pretty good. The buffalo chicken spread and the jerked salmon are awesome. The service is always good especially at the bar. They have an upstairs lounge that is open for happy hour during the week. If you are looking to grab a few drinks after work with friends$LABEL$4
We decided to stop by Olive or Twist on a recent Saturday night before a show. A friend was at a wedding upstairs and asked us to drop in to say hi. Apparently they host wedding receptions in the lounge area above the bar/restaurant. I was hoping to get a quick meal and a drink before the show. When we arrived the bar was packed and we were told that they had no availability to sit in the restaurant section. But$LABEL$3
We went here for drinks and a bite before a concert at nearby Byham theater. We had wings and a piece of cookies and cream cake. Both were outstanding. We both had the Fat Gary's Ale$LABEL$3
This bar is cramped$LABEL$1
Very disappointed.  I had been to Olive or Twist for drinks and really enjoyed it but had never been there for a meal.  I was going to a show at the Benedum with a friend and made reservations about a week and a half before the show.  We arrived about 15 minutes early for our 6:00 reservation expecting we may not be able to be seated yet.  The problem is that even though I called and made a reservation (including the person answering the phone taking my name and phone number and repeating the date and time) we were told there was no reservation for our name.  The hostess said something along the lines of \""are you sure you called here to make a reservation and not somewhere else\""  Yes$LABEL$1
I was really excited when I saw the menu for this place because they had some vegetarian items that sounded delicious. I liked the decor$LABEL$2
So I decided to surprise my fianc\u00e9 one night by taking her here(because we've been talking about doing so for a while). We both got martinis and the nachos and buffalo spread apps. The martinis were just ok$LABEL$2
At the request of a friend$LABEL$1
I stopped in last night for a drink with a group of friends... we were in town visiting and I had been wanting to try this place out since we walked past it on the last trip... what a disappointment.  The server was prompt to greet us and drop off drink menus$LABEL$1
Friday night out with one of my best friends and we were looking for a cool place to check out downtown. I always wanted to give this place a shot so we came here. The first floor was a little crowded$LABEL$3
My family and I went to Olive or Twist before a Pirate Game. The food was delicious! I had the crab cake sandwich. The happy hour specials were also a plus. I had a cake batter martini which was tasty! The location is also convenient for anyone going to a game. We walked over Roberto Clemente bridge and were right there. We will definitely be going back! Great work Olive or Twist!$LABEL$5
The bar staff is great$LABEL$3
Go for the martinis$LABEL$3
Hands down one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh! The atmosphere is great and the martini list is extensive. I've ordered the cake batter$LABEL$4
Visited with a party of 8 last weekend for a friend's birthday. We walked in the door and could see no apparent host stand$LABEL$2
After hearing about their cocktails$LABEL$3
This place was adorable. Very nice inside. Solid wood bar long L-shaped with chairs. They also had tables & chairs set up in the back half of the place for table seating. My co-worker and I sat at the bar close to the door and had a few drinks. They served food but we weren't offered a menu  (hence the 3 stars). The bartender wasn't very friendly-later I realize that was just her personality. Still not so cute! They have really good martinis. We had a s'mores which was awesome and came with a chocolate covered marshmallow. We also got a prickly pear. Mmmmmmmm is all I have to say. If I'm ever in Pitts again I would go back cause I know the drinks are very good!P. S. They also had an upstairs not sure what was going on up there. Thinking maybe it was a restaurant cause kids were going up with adults.$LABEL$3
Fantastic martinis!!$LABEL$4
Always a good spot if you are craving a martini. As per the waitress recommendation$LABEL$5
This was our second visit to Olive or Twist.  We came over this past summer for food and cocktails$LABEL$3
Nice location$LABEL$3
This is my favorite Italian market in Pittsburgh.  I buy food from here almost every week.  It doesn't have the crazy selection (or crazy crowd) of Penn Mac$LABEL$4
Completely agree with Deborah: decent sandwich on absolutely horrible bread - mealy tomato and brown lettuce$LABEL$1
$3.00 fresh baked Italian loaf$LABEL$5
I need to indulge myself on the rest of this establishment but review is limited to the bread they sell on the street.  On a crowded street you will find a very funny bread-salesmen gunning for your attention to be focused on the racks of bread loafs behind him.  Well sir$LABEL$4
Don't go if you want a nice dining environment.  To say the furnishings in the dining area are spartan would be an understatement.But$LABEL$4
The italian coldcut sub was a travesty! Lots of STALE bread with skimpy meat portions$LABEL$1
The Port Authority bus system in Pittsburgh gets a lot of attention. There are lots of articles in the newspapers$LABEL$4
Better than most transit systems in cities of this size. It gets you where you need to go$LABEL$3
Very nice cheap quick bus service to airport. (28X).  but i think i've found out what happens to all the old buses in Seattle$LABEL$4
It worked$LABEL$3
First time in Pittsburgh$LABEL$1
Fares keep going up. Another service cut this month. I think I'd rather walk to work in the middle of the night!$LABEL$2
I regularly take the bus to work and am grateful that Pittsburgh has a bus system.  Google Maps seems to have fairly up-to-date schedules to determine which buses to take to get from one location to another.  It's also free for me as a Pitt employee.  However$LABEL$3
I called Pittsburgh my temporary home three summers in a row. I went to the University of Pittsburgh for SLI: Summer Language Institute from '05-'07. The university$LABEL$4
I've only taken Port Authority transit in the summer.  That probably colors my opinion on it$LABEL$3
Oh$LABEL$2
I would give it a \""1-star\"" review but the caption under \""2-star\"" is more like it$LABEL$2
Last night marked the second time in a week that I waited 30 minutes or more for a 71B in the freezing cold rain.   I was 5 minutes early for the bus I was trying to catch.  I can understand a delay during rush hour$LABEL$1
I don't even really know where to begin with this review. I guess the most sensical thing to do with such a nonsensical transit system is a pros and cons list. (If nothing it will be the quickest and least painful for me and for you$LABEL$2
Don't ever get too comfortable with PAT--- they end up swiping everything out from under your feet$LABEL$1
Well$LABEL$2
A BIG FAT DISAPPOINTMENTI am concerned with the future of Port Authority$LABEL$2
I don't understand why Pittsburghers routinely put up with the idiocy that is our public transportation system.  Port Authority of Allegheny County is public transportation with massive$LABEL$1
I took the bus several times on a recent trip to Pittsburgh.The 28X/\""airport flyer\"" is a good option to get from PIT to the city--and at $3.75$LABEL$3
Port Authority of Allegheny County employs some very$LABEL$1
As a car-less denizen of PGH$LABEL$2
4.5 stars????   Really?????  Based on what?   The food is okay$LABEL$2
Good hangover breakfast. HUGE portions. ANGRY service. Get the sausage.$LABEL$3
My heart is still trying to get back into regular running mode.. The portions from this place are insane.  Food is delicious$LABEL$5
First off:  I'm a picky eater$LABEL$1
Clearly based on other reviews$LABEL$1
Not a bad store for a few tough-to-find Middle Eastern items$LABEL$3
The store is small$LABEL$4
This review is for both the particular location that I used back on September 23rd$LABEL$5
This was the worst service I have ever gotten$LABEL$1
Not a bad place to pick up supplies for Mixology class! In fact$LABEL$3
i find i can no longer be a customer at salon christine. christine's conduct/attitude toward me regarding my valid question about aveda products possibly reverting back to animal testing was rude$LABEL$1
I purchased a gift certificate up front from them only to find out that they were never going to let me use it.    I kept calling to try to make appointments and each time I called$LABEL$1
You know how you say$LABEL$5
Pastrami and cole slaw and fries$LABEL$4
JR H and I seemed to miss each other this weekend in Pitt. Always going to the same place yet not really.  Our little group$LABEL$4
God I miss this place. Best sandwiches in the Burgh. If you are down near the Strip$LABEL$5
Whenever I happen to be in Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
Here's how you can make your own Primanti Bros Sandwich at home:Take two slices of Italian Bread$LABEL$2
One night I was watching the Travel channel$LABEL$4
I was out of town in Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
Dude. A meal on Mancini Bros. bread. Not much to say$LABEL$4
If ewe don like Primanti's$LABEL$5
The food was just OK. Soggy french fries on a greasy cheese steak pattie.  The service was awful$LABEL$1
Update.  Went to a different location.  Non-smoking location.  Got pastrami this time instead of the bland sausage.  Added a fried egg to the sandwich as well.  I forgot how huge this thing was.  I could only eat half.  I am now a fan of Primanti's.$LABEL$4
Stopped in here while passing through Pittsburgh without knowing anything about the city or this establishment. Like gnats$LABEL$4
We ate at Primanti Bros based on the reviews on Yelp$LABEL$1
Worst sandwich on Earth.I'd rather eat a dead whore.Please...never come here.$LABEL$1
This is my second dance with Primanti's.  The first was at the Pitt location$LABEL$4
I'm gonna get slaughtered for giving this place a bad review$LABEL$2
GROSS!!! Many people told me to go here and I was totally disappointed! It was bland$LABEL$1
i was here for work and ordred the #2  The cheesesteak was nice and square and stuff.  Hmm not sure if that's a good thing?  The combination of coleslaw and fries plus that really nice thick spongy bread was pretty good.  I would actually say this would be more like a 4 star sandwich but I have a deep seeded hatred for the Steelers so yeah whatever.  I'd like to see a sandwich superbowl$LABEL$3
Alright$LABEL$2
The description of a Primanti Bros sandwich is tastier than the sandwich itself.  One of two dozen different meats topped with french fries and coleslaw;  I tried hot sausage.  The problem is that all that potato and cabbage mutes the flavor of the meat.  Expecting an extremely tasty sandwich$LABEL$3
Everyone knows that that if you go to Pittsburgh$LABEL$1
Everyone that comes to Pittsburgh must try Primanti Bros at least once. I have been there multiple times but this is my first review of the place. The sandwich is something to see and eat especially after a night of drinking. The original location is definitely the best especially for the people watching aspect. I chose the sandwich with bacon and cheese and it was definitely consistent with the other times I have been there$LABEL$4
There were French fries on my sandwich!This is my first time in PA$LABEL$4
The fries and 'slaw piled into all of the sandwiches is a cool local niche$LABEL$3
an efficient way to eat - meat$LABEL$4
I came to Primanti Brothers after my roommate said Pittsburgh was known for it.  I read several reviews and went with the pastrami sandwich.  It was good.  Just the right amount of meat (I hate it when the meat overpowers the entire sandwich)$LABEL$3
Okay$LABEL$2
My first time at Primanti Bros in Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
After sitting there and being ignored for 25 minutes we just left!$LABEL$1
I'm with others here - not a lover of Primanti Bros.  Sandwiches are fine (I have ordered the turkey and cheese) but the service is horrible.  Rude$LABEL$2
Decided to try the place since I heard about it and is listed in things to do in Pittsburgh. This place is really connected to Pittsburgh itself and Conan even mentioned it in one of his shows as a place to eat at.Ordered the \""2nd most popular\"" item which was the cheesesteak that was very$LABEL$2
When I told people I was going to Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
I am still trying to figure out how to transport a few sandwiches back on the plane.....There is just something about Pittsburgh and their traditional comfort food!  I have addicted my husband.$LABEL$5
eh.Go here once to say you did. You'll get a sandwich with soggy fries and coleslaw on it. It will be pretty huge. That is all.I might go back to check out the nightlife. I'll update my review then.$LABEL$2
It wasn't bad$LABEL$2
I saw this place on Man vs Food and thought I would check it out. I ordered the pastrami with cheese. The sandwich was humongous!!!! It was filled with cheese$LABEL$3
Woulda been a 1 star review if not for our cute & courteous waitress.That said: YUCK!   This was my second supremely dissapointing Primanti's experience in nearly a decade of living in this fine little city.  I guess the fascination with this place must be that it it 1. has a bar 2. you don't have to order a side of fries or coleslaw because it's all gonna be slathered on your sandwich.  Bleh!  On my first Primanti experience$LABEL$2
The legendary Primanti Bros.  I believe I had been to Pittsburgh 10+ times before my first visit.  That being said I'm (a) glad I went (b) ok with it taking that long (c) really enjoyed the roast beef and cheese (d) easily would have paid more than the $7 ticket price (e) definitely need to hit the treadmill tomorrow and (f) thankful to not live next door.Overall$LABEL$3
Based on what I've read on yelp$LABEL$4
When i told everyone I was going to Pittsburgh - Primanti Bros is one place everyone said I should try.Primanti Bros.'s sandwich = meat + cole slaw + french friesI ordered the pastrami and it was really good! The pastrami was lean and warm. I'm not a big fan of cole slaw but their cole slaw was pretty good. It was more like pickled vegetable; the pieces were big instead of chopped up finely which i liked. The french fries were a bit of a challenge to keep inside though.I would recommend trying Primanti's if you're in the area!$LABEL$3
I understand Primanti is a historic institution here in Pittsburgh but other than the name I don't think it has much going on unless you're in the mood for quantity versus quality. I got reeled into my experience because everyone said to try it when I moved here. Really simple menu as you just choose the meat you'd like in your sandwich. I went with pastrami which was good but the combination of the cole slaw$LABEL$2
I walked in$LABEL$2
So after hearing about all the raves and reviews about Primanti Bros$LABEL$3
So had a short stop at pittsburgh before heading out to the airport and decided to go on a food adventure...  After getting lost and going to the closed location$LABEL$5
yikes!! just make sure you don't go there during lunch. it's def a ton of food and sure cause for afternoon food coma. the food itself was delish. never really thought of putting everything$LABEL$4
Maybe the expectations were too high$LABEL$2
Clearly should have read a few reviews before going here. Whenever I go to these types of iconic regional dining establishments$LABEL$1
When there's this much hype about a place$LABEL$5
I heard from everyone that the Primanti sandwiches are the quintessential Pittsburgh food. We scored a nice seat outside and indulged in some Iron Hill beer that was on special for $2 for a  20 oz beer. The sandwiches were fine and were inexpensive.Be warned that everything here comes with french fries$LABEL$2
Wildly overrated.  I compare it to Pat's and Geno's in Philly$LABEL$1
Why waste time? Want a sandwich$LABEL$3
I realize it's a sandwich shop and I dared to order a salad - but their menu is limited - so why put something on it if you're not going to do it right? Ordered a grilled chicken salad$LABEL$1
Really bad service. Make sure to get in the face of the wait staff or count on being ignored$LABEL$1
I guess you have to try this out if your not from Pittsburgh!I had the sweet sausage$LABEL$3
Primanti Bros sells sandwiches. Only$LABEL$4
Mmmmmm$LABEL$4
Primanti's is a Pittsburgh institution.  The original is in the strip district just outside of downtown proper.  They are famous for large sandwiches with the fries IN the sandwich$LABEL$2
Never heard of this place. Only heard/went there because my dad wanted to.Great atmosphere. Server was very good. Overall great service. Beer selection was OK. Low price for lots of food.Had the cheesesteak. It was ok. Nothing special. Like most \""fat sandwiches$LABEL$3
Ok$LABEL$5
I love the concept but I think it is overrated.  I have been hearing so much hype about Primanti Brothers that I was so excited to finally get to stop in at one.  I have no problem with the size or amount of grease$LABEL$3
I thought it was solid.  I got the Pittsburgher with an Iron City.  I had to experience Primanti and I enjoyed it.  Service was good on a Friday afternoon$LABEL$3
Fries were kind of bland and the coleslaw was just ok but the meat was very good. Overall$LABEL$4
Primanti Brothers is definitely a Pittsburgh institution. If you are traveling through$LABEL$2
This place isn't for a light lunch. Their famous sandwiches include a variety of grilled meats (the cheese steak its second-best seller) with french fries$LABEL$3
Fries and cole slaw in the sandwich was interesting...pretty good. Don't come here if you don't like messy food. My sandwich kind of fell apart. Also$LABEL$3
I really don't know what the hype is about.  I was quite underwhelmed with this restaurant.$LABEL$2
It was a decently filling sandwich$LABEL$3
ate at the one in North Versailles. floor filty$LABEL$1
my friends at Pittsburgh said that it must a try! that was I went there! I had an steak sandwich$LABEL$4
it's been close to 5 years since i've had primanti's$LABEL$5
Prior to writing my review for Primanti Bros.$LABEL$2
I was very excited to go here because of all the buzz about this place.  To be honest this place was not that good at all.  The sandwiches$LABEL$2
So this is a Pittsburgh instiitution??  Am so underwhelmed.  After waiting more than 20 minutes for our sandwiches (in the end these are still just sandwiches)$LABEL$1
I hit the Primanti Brothers Market Square location to see if the sandwich lives up to the legend and it does. The shop offers a wide array of versions from beef to fish but the grilled steak has rich flavor that is nicely cut by the slightly vinegary Cole slaw. The addition of the fries and Cole slaw on top of the sandwich will make any of the offerings at Primanti a delicious and unique flavor of Pittsburgh.$LABEL$3
Underwhelming is one word that comes to mind. The meat tasted cheap$LABEL$2
Just writing a review makes my mouth water. I've only been once but I got one of the well-known pastrami sandwiches loaded with fries and cole slaw. It's huge$LABEL$5
I have seen many food show on the Primati famous sandwich$LABEL$4
I am a foodie so when I travel$LABEL$4
Boring sandwich. Period. I fell for the \""hype\"" and while it was filling for $7 bucks$LABEL$2
When I first moved to Pittsburgh 2 years ago$LABEL$4
I think I made the mistake of coming here sober. Primanti's is great if you've had a few. Oddly$LABEL$3
Definitely a fan of all their sandwiches. Worth the drive from anywhere. And if you're a local and have never eaten here you don't know what you're missing. Definitely a lot of sandwich for the $.  A legendary Pittsburgh establishment through and through.$LABEL$4
I loved my Pgh-style sandwich with cole slaw and fries in it. Wish I could have my sandwich like that everyday! The quality of the bread$LABEL$4
I was visiting Pittsburgh recently a was told by more than one person that I have to visit Primanti Bros.  We originally planned on the Cherry Way location but were in Market Square and we were starving. We walked in and it was pretty busy.  We waited a few minutes for an empty table and found one.  We cleaned if off ourselves and that was okay with me.  I was pretty excited about this place because of the reviews and other personal recommendations.  I ordered a ham and cheese sandwich and my partner ordered one with more than one type of lunch meat.  The sandwiches were simply sandwiches with coleslaw and French fries on top.  There was nothing special about it and it's something easily made at home.  The price was good.  For a beer$LABEL$3
Good beer and food was really good but the service was mediocre at best. But I love that I can here the game and not random music by Rihanna$LABEL$4
This place is basically \""the place\"" you hear about when you say you are going to Pittsburgh. And I am glad I tried it. I can see it being bringing back memories of college days to any alumni.+friendly service. It was day 2 of our cashier/ waitress and I thought she was pretty amazing. +fries are delicious in general$LABEL$3
Well$LABEL$1
I heard good things..after all Primanti Brothers have developed a nice chain in the area.Great service very helpful...I had the guys pick the sandwich for me.  I got There best selling burger....it was a hamburger with fries in it.   Not a fan of the idea.  Overall kinda boring(Sorry) but it is what it is.  The meat tasted like meat which was a nice change but the toppings were just down right sad.  Fries where a  step up from the norm and for a price of under 7 bucks it sure beats any fast food chain.$LABEL$3
How are there only 5 reviews?  As I understand it$LABEL$4
Good sandwiches as you expect$LABEL$4
We did the obligatory Primanti Bros stop on our recent first visit to Pittsburgh. We can understand how it's a novelty to have fries on everything. But if they're not seasoned well and crisp...what's the point? When a place gets talked up so much$LABEL$2
I have eaten better sandwiches but stopping for lunch at Primanti Bros was an overall great experience. I sat inside at the bar where I was afforded a bird's eye view of the grill. You should expect to eat a sandwich with a handful of french fries and a handful of cole slaw smashed on top of whatever meat/cheese combination you may have ordered. I would definitely recommend sitting at the bar to take in the full experience.$LABEL$3
Can't go to Pittsburgh and not try one of their sandwiches! A bit overrated in my option though... Sandwiches are huge$LABEL$3
I can't for the life of me figure out why all the hype. I was warned by others that this is mainly where tourists eat. But I'm a tourist here$LABEL$1
Disappointed$LABEL$2
My sister-in-law$LABEL$2
Nice menu and good service I recommend$LABEL$4
I was first excited that it's one of those places they review on the Food Network where they make specialty sandwiches$LABEL$3
I've heard all the hype and wanted to try it.  Tonight was my second attempt here.   First time$LABEL$1
This joint makes excellent sandwiches. I ordered the fish sandwich and it was delicious! First off$LABEL$4
Had lunch here while visiting friends in the area .... After seeing all the hype about this place on various tv food shows I was very excited to eat hear . WOW$LABEL$1
If you like sandwiches with french fries piled on them$LABEL$2
I was really looking forward to a huge tasty sandwich but was greatly disappointed! Everything was bland$LABEL$1
Super slow service. They have inside and outside seating which is nice. However$LABEL$1
This place holds a nostalgic appeal for people born and raised in Pittsburgh who grew up eating here. If that experience is what your looking for$LABEL$2
I like sandwich and stuff as much as anyone else. this place was pretty good. The prices were good also. the staff was good. Everything worked out the way it should. There were no negative surprise. No poistive surprises either. It was a nice resturant.$LABEL$3
Returned to Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
Got a sandwich to go so I can't give a full review but when I ate it$LABEL$3
I heard this place stacks fries and cole slaw onto your sandwich so I gotta try it. I ordered the drunk duck drink and it was fantastic. I got to keep the little rubber ducky on top of my drink too :)  As for the sandwich$LABEL$4
I had lived outside of Pittsburgh for a couple of years and have eaten at this Primanti Brothers location four or five times. Their sandwiches were always tasty$LABEL$1
Had such high hopes for this place on our visit to Pittsburgh.  The presentation of the sandwiches were making my mouth water$LABEL$2
Visiting Pittsburgh from out of town$LABEL$3
Primanti Bros is the dirty guilty pleasure that I give into once a year.Most times$LABEL$3
Worst service ever.  The waitress and I use that term loosely rolled her eyes at any question when ordering and yelled at someone at the table for asking for coleslaw on the side.  Then she had to come back and re ask the orders again and got mad when we repeated about the coleslaw since she didn't repeat it back.  When she brought out the food she just slammed the food down and just shouted out the name of one of the sandwiches um are you asking who had which sandwich which is your job to remember anyways.  I'm glad I don't live in Pittsburgh to have to worry about avoiding this place.$LABEL$1
My partner wanted to try a Pittsburgh cheesesteak sandwich and we read this was the best place to go. I don't like fries and I don't eat cheese$LABEL$4
Can I give this place ZERO stars? They're supposively \""famous\"" for their sandwiches so some friends and I go when we are in town. The waitresses all rolled their eyes and glared at me for not wanting my fries on top of my sandwich. (Not to mention the waitress was in the skimpiest tank top with her bra hanging out while waiting on us and grilling food. Gross.) I get that your famous for having fries on the sandwich but regardless$LABEL$1
This is the most overrated place bragged about in Pittsburgh. My first visit was to the one in South Hills. Waited 90 mins for 4 sandwiches. The coleslaw is gross and I'm a fan of coleslaw. Due to the 90 min wait I was given a gift card which I used at the one in Market Square. This time I got the grilled chicken salad. If you like chewing on rubber bands$LABEL$1
I ordered a fave of diners$LABEL$2
My brother mentioned that he'd heard about this place in Pittsburgh that puts coleslaw and fries on their sandwiches. Sounded good and I was in town so I thought I'd give it a shot! I went around 4 pm on a Saturday and it was pretty busy! Usually a good sign. There were only about 3 people in front of me in the takeout line$LABEL$3
Had to try this while in Pittsburgh. Ate the first half of my sandwich with the slaw & the fries but by the time I got to the second half I took the fries off because they were cold. I had the pastrami & asked for extra cheese. Didn't get the extra cheese. Feel like the sandwiches are missing something. Might be good with a thousand island dressing or \""secret sauce\"". Underwhelmed but still recommend trying it at least once for the experience.Market square location was confusing because seat yourself but wasn't clear.$LABEL$3
Primanti bros has the best corned beef sandwich in the east$LABEL$5
My Order: Pitts-Burger (ok) & Raspberry Lemon Tea (not bad; sweet) Pros: - notably$LABEL$3
Alright so being from Texas I'm used to lots of seasoning$LABEL$2
Highly disappointing. While sandwich is unique it was totally over cooked and under seasoned. No flavor$LABEL$2
So an honest review.  Bland.  Service good prices cheap but food very bland and pre made.  I ordered the new black bean burger sandwich.  Bread not toasted$LABEL$2
i guess if you are in Pittsburgh and you want to do Pittsburgh things you have to grab a Primanti Bros sandwich but it isn't that good of a sandwich. Pittsburgh is loaded with great places to eat.  you can certainly do better.  having said that$LABEL$2
First time going...and I LOVED IT! Great service$LABEL$5
Service was bad. Server walked away before we were done ordering and then when someone got her attention she had to return 5 minutes later to re clarify which it was wrong. We didn't see her for a good 20 minutes and had to go up to the bar for refills. She did take one of our cups to refill it$LABEL$1
First Yelp review ever. Not impressed at all! 45% bread$LABEL$1
There are some places that are better when you grow up or at least have memories while eating at a restaurant. This was highly recommended to us while visiting Pittsburgh. First$LABEL$2
I had the famous Pitts-Burger and it was disgusting! The only reason I'm giving it two stars is because of the bread. The bread is super soft and tasty but the meat was gross and the cole slaw was bitter. I don't see what the hype is all about!$LABEL$2
If you've been to Pittsburgh you know what to expect from a Primanti Sandwich. When I'm in the mood for them$LABEL$2
I was pleasantly surprised!  I went in with low expectations after seeing the so-so reviews and hearing from people that it's not all it's cracked up to be.  Got the steak sandwich with everything on it.  I ate most of it and wasn't even that hungry to begin with.  Definitely needed salt/pepper and the hot sauce they had.  When you add potatoes to a sandwich it tends to make it taste bland unless you have a killer sauce.  The sandwich could feed most people for two meals and it's only $7..great value.  23 oz miller lite was only $4..also so cheap.  We enjoyed sitting at the bar and watching the head cook make quick work of 100+ sandwiches.  These people got the routine down pat.  I would definitely eat it again and appreciate the history of the place.$LABEL$4
The restaurant did their level best to make it up to me$LABEL$3
Definitely didn't live up to the expectations.  Being from the east coast I've had my fair share of delicious sandwiches.  Stopped in for lunch and had the capicola sandwich.  Outside of the bread I can't say it was memorable in any way.That said I could see this as a post night out stop and would probably enjoy it a lot more.$LABEL$2
Well$LABEL$2
Had the second best seller which was really good.   A nice carb coma from the italian bread and fries.  A great mix of salty from the meat and those aforementioned fries with the sweet from the slaw!  The service was good so why only three stars?  Well$LABEL$3
This was a fun sandwich as I was visiting Pittsburgh. It was neat to hear the origin that truck drivers just wanted their cole slaw & fries slapped in with the sandwich so they could eat it on the go. I appreciate the concept & it's worth a try but I don't need to come back. I liked fat heads more.$LABEL$3
The beer selection is limited to what you might find in convince store (in states where this is possible. Sandwiches are Pittsburgh landmarks though and the food is good but nothing truly special. Great place to hang with friends$LABEL$3
customer service is always nice but dont you all think that this place is little over-rated? Their 'Almost Famous Sandwitches' need some hard work to get famous. Basically$LABEL$2
We decided to stop by Primanti brothers after hearing all the hype from everyone. We were already primed with the fact that their sandwiches are stuffed with fries so we decided to just share one sandwich. And holy moley was it colossal (well we DID get the colossal fish and cheese). We ended up taking most of the fries out because it got too heavy and filling. The coleslaw in the sandwich was pretty good-- not a huge amount of mayo which is what I like. However$LABEL$3
I go to Point Park so this Primanti's is a staple for me and my friends. We go here probably 4 or 5 times a semester - always in groups of at least 4 and often more. The food is so great it's hard to care about anything else. I usually get the capicola with an egg$LABEL$4
I knew that once we hit Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
I've tried it twice now because if you ever mention you're going to Pittsburgh the first thing you hear is \""Oh Man$LABEL$2
The sandwiches are interesting and the fries in them are interesting.I don't like fries or potatoey fries$LABEL$3
I don't care for Primanti brothers.  It is overrated.  There are much better sandwiches in the city.The sandwiches aren't bad$LABEL$2
Monte Cello's Downtown does not look like much from the outside.  It is wedged into a small triangular shaped building.  They are open for lunch and dinner.  Their pizza has been a staple of Downtown since 1980.Their specialty pizzas include spinach and feta cheese pizza$LABEL$3
I've eaten here several times.  Their pizza is good.  The only annoying thing is the small fountain drinks that come with the lunch specials (and no refills).  But the best thing$LABEL$4
It's been awhile since I've reviewed Monte Cello's so I thought I'd hit it again yesterday.  Monte Cello's in a rather unassuming building.  It's a little cramped in there and definitely not the most inviting place in the world.  But yesterday was one of those picture perfect summer days--perfect for getting a good sandwich or slice and heading over to a plaza for some Al Fresco dining (unfortunately Al Fresco called in sick so I had to eat alone).So let's see$LABEL$3
My office often gets Pizza delivered from Monte Cello's. The crust is thin and the pizza is decent.  I have gone there a few times for lunch to grab a few slices of pizza (with others). I agree that the small fountain drinks with no refills is annoying.  If I am going to eat in$LABEL$3
Monte Cellos is located fairly close to my work$LABEL$2
Very close to work for me and the others in my office.  Was excited about getting a steak salad$LABEL$3
I'm picky about the quality of meat$LABEL$2
There are always atleast 2 group of annoying kids who just loiter and stare at everyone as they're walking in & out. The staff doesn't seem to care. Make sure to check your fries before you leave bc they are sometimes Luke warm. Even after you buy something it's a challenge for them to unlock the bathroom. You stand at the door 5min$LABEL$2
I don't know why but this McDonalds always managed to get my order wrong.  This is almost constant.   However there is a young assistant management who is extremely professional and friendly.  He make sure that all of the customers incorrect orders are made correctly. I believe his name is Matt or something that begins with a M.  (Young guy$LABEL$2

Awesome tortillas$LABEL$4
Their tacos are alright but their groceries are kind of expensive. I've never seen a can of Goya brand beans priced at $1.50. I mean it seems like a little thing$LABEL$2
I think this should be more like 1.5 stars. I got a 6-pack of tamales. They were more expensive than I would've guessed (I sort of had to$LABEL$2
I've been to the taco stand now!  Yaaaaaaaaaaay!  On our way out of town for the holidays$LABEL$4
I ate a taco here in the snow. IN THE SNOW! I've eaten a taco here sweating my bum off. I\""ve eaten a taco standing up because there's no tables. This taco stand is so amazing that I'll pretty much eat a taco here during a hurricane....if those happened in western PA! Does this not show my true devotion to these tasty little taco's! Ok$LABEL$5
Just moved out to Pittsburgh from San Diego and I was so shocked to find they serve Carne Asada here. This shop is a life saver when I want to have some authentic mexican food.$LABEL$5
Beans$LABEL$4
Good: Mexican groceries in PittsburghBetter: The chipotle tomatillo salsa$LABEL$4
Reyna's Food saved my life!!!Ok$LABEL$4
Being from LA$LABEL$1
Where to begin$LABEL$5
The stand outside (edgars)$LABEL$5
Very good Mexican place! I got the enchiladas verdes which were a little too spicy for me but very good. My boyfriend got a steak quesadilla which was AMAZING! I wish I ordered it. Friendly staff and comfortable setting!Been here twice... The second time I ordered the guacamole which they made fresh in front of u! We loved it and will order it again.$LABEL$4
This review is for the taco stand in front of Reyna's$LABEL$1
This is a top-notch mexican grocery$LABEL$5
I just moved to Pittsburgh from New Mexico and was excited to hear about this place. Unfortunately$LABEL$2
I have shopped here periodically over the last 8 years I have lived in Pittsburgh but after this last visit NEVER AGAIN! The woman working there was so rude I could hardly believe it. A gentleman came in speaking Spanish and she gave him attitude and even after he started speaking English she was still rude to him.  I accidentally dropped a small bottle of hot syrup ( my bad) I apologized profusely and felt so bad I bought a bunch of other stuff- even after the woman was really nasty about the whole situation. After I walked out I realized she charged me for the broken bottle without even telling me! I guess I should have just walked out without buying stuff. Its a shame because they are close to where I live but next time I'll take the trip to one of the Mexican groceries in Brookline.$LABEL$2
I went there on a Saturday afternoon by myself and wanted to sit out front.  The host made fun of me!  Said \""aw$LABEL$3
I went here for the first time on Saturday night. I had to go & try the famous Giant Fish Sandwich! When it arrived$LABEL$4
OMG what a nightmare. I was there last saturday at 9pm with a group of 10 people in the second floor bar area. The bartenders acted like it was a big inconvience that we were there. ordered drinks and didnt even get a thank you. the bar was dirty and littered with dirty glasses. The restrooms were filthy and didnt even have toliet paper . We left the bar and spent a HUGE anoun of money up the street.. I will never go back.$LABEL$1
I've been here twice. The first time was at least two years ago and I can't remember anything in particular about it.The second time$LABEL$2
Another place that I visit once every few years thinking it couldn't be as bad as I remember it.  And the place NEVER lets me down; it's just as bad as I remember.  The seafood is breaded and fried to the point of inedible.  The staff is rude.  The prices are too high for the quality.  Just all around disappointing.$LABEL$1
My scallops were luke-warm yet overcooked.  The carrots on my salad looked like they had been sitting in the bottom of a fridge for weeks. The first time I dined here$LABEL$2
I hesitate to even write this review because technically we didn't eat here.  But after reading the other reviews$LABEL$1
Went to this place for lunch last Saturday$LABEL$1
Messy floors but quick waiter$LABEL$3
I went here on a Friday afternoon for lunch with some coworkers. We were a party of 12. Even though the restaurant was busy$LABEL$3
We spent a few hours here on the day of the St. Patrick's Day parade$LABEL$4
NEVER AGAIN!!!! Horrible service and horrible food! It took 20 minutes for our waitress to even come to our table! Looking back on it$LABEL$1
I was immediately displeased by the snaggle toothed hostess and her surly demeanor. The air conditioning was non existent$LABEL$2
It was raining and we were in the Strip district craving some seafood.  We decided to stop by Roland's Seafood Grill.We were seated right away close to the bar in front of the big screen projector where the US open was playing.  Our orders were taken right away then we waited for 30 minutes before our meals came out.  We were glad for the US Open entertainment.My dad order the clam chowder soup$LABEL$2
We had a frustrating and disappointing experience at Roland's$LABEL$1
Extremely Slow Service!   We have eaten here many times and$LABEL$2
In the Strip District$LABEL$3
We headed to the strip district to soak in the atmosphere like any good tourist should do.Unfortunately we love to sleep and showed up a little late and by the time we were ready to eat (around 4pm) our list of recommended places to try were already closed for the day. Roland's was open though. As an added bonus they were showing the Steeler's game and there is nothing that Pittsburgh loves more than supporting the Steeler's and Penguin's. The atmosphere was great with everyone dressed in black and yellow and really into the game.We ordered wedding soup (pretty delicious) and Portobello Mushroom Pizza. Maybe our mistake was not ordering seafood$LABEL$2
As others have said$LABEL$2
I would give this restaurant 0 stars if I could.  The food was lousy$LABEL$1
I was only here for drinks$LABEL$3
Well I have had several meals over the years at Rolands$LABEL$2
Yuck!It's almost embarrassing having this place exist in the Strip with so many tourists coming here.  That has to be how they're making their money because it's certainly not on their food or service.  Well$LABEL$1
The Lobster Roll Caesar Salad was very good$LABEL$3
I am only judging this place as a bar$LABEL$3
Just awful. My companions each ordered an Alfredo pasta and they both honestly thought (through the entire meal) that Roland's had served mashed potatoes on the pasta.We thought \""maybe it's a 'burgh thing.\""Nope$LABEL$1
this place reeks of fish when you walk in and there are fruit flies everywhere.  Good place to dine if you're on a diet since you will surely lose your appetite.If you find yourself at Rolands$LABEL$1
My fiance and I went to Roland's for a \""date night\"".  We were both craving seafood$LABEL$1
Aah$LABEL$3
If I had to chose between dining at Roland's again$LABEL$1
Stopped in for a pint.  Had some pizza (was OK) and hit another place.$LABEL$3
Hey. This place is deeeeeeeeCENT.(look$LABEL$3
Love the lobster roll.  I like to stop in here on Mondays for 0.60C raw oysters and a bloody hoe.  Makes a great after work/pre work-out snack.$LABEL$3
we went three for st$LABEL$2
There were 3 of us on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. Surprisingly Roland's was 3/4 full. With 3 waitresses. They were RUNNING to fill orders. The fish was hot and crispy. It was fried but it was good. The French fries with it tasted as if they were fried in the same grease or an oil that should've been changed several days ago. The Mussels were OK. But the Clams Casino were inedible. The clams were served raw with a burnt bread crumb topping. The crab cakes were also bad. Both went back.  The waitress never asked if we wanted something else or if the rest of the meals were fine. The New England Clam Chowder was good but overpowered by the smoky bacon that was added to the soup. No$LABEL$2
The only reason this gets three stars instead of two is because of the Lobster roll.  Since working in NYC for a few months$LABEL$3
Came here with a bunch of friends on a Friday night to watch the pens game. They have a nice atmosphere and relatively good service considering it was dinner time. A few more tvs and a few more tables would give it at least one more star. One strange thing I have to mention is that they did not have any beer specials during happy hour? Not sure if this is normal$LABEL$3
Poor service. Monday evening. restaurant not busy. Took 15 minutes before someone came to take our drink order. Ordered a draft and a glass of wine and proceeded to order a lobster roll and steamed mussels. Took another 10 minutes to get the drinks. The lobster roll then showed up and we had finished and the plate was then cleared for the table. We had then been in the restaurant for an hour and we asked for the bill. The waitress then proceeded to say the mussels were ready. We canceled the order and the bill came with a quick huff and sign the top copy please request as she quickly turned away. Not worth wasting your time.$LABEL$2
Went on a Wednesday night$LABEL$2
Lobster roll was awesome.  There was a Moosehead beer cap in our fries and the waitress' response was$LABEL$2
Not as good as Wholeys but awesome patio and the best service. Go here for the atmosphere$LABEL$4
Prime time location$LABEL$2
Roland's was recommended by hotel. Service was terrible. Food was cold. Brick oven pizza cold.... Asked to have it reheated$LABEL$1
Friends warned me not to eat here. Turns out they were GOOD friends. This was just awful$LABEL$1
Decided to try it for dinner as we were walking around the strip.  Good selection of beers too.Started with mussels and they were very good.  Sherry butter sauce w lots of garlic.We each had the seafood stew for dinner...tried to get beyond the lobster roll which is their signature dishStew was full of seafood.  Lobster$LABEL$5
I love Roland's happy hour! It's for a raw bar rather than the actual bar. 60 cent oysters$LABEL$3
I gave this place a 3 star because the service and drinks are great. It's a great place to have a beer with friends  but the food is gross....$LABEL$3
Let's see.... Rolands can be fun to go to for happy hour after work on Friday.  Heck they used to have these two bartenders that if you were a good looking girl at least one would give you a beer or two but making up the difference by overcharging or flat out giving incorrect change back to some male patrons.  Anyhow$LABEL$2
The bar has a nice selection of beers. The Irish bartender who works Monday nights is extremely welcoming and friendly.  For food I tried the raw bar happy hour. The oysters were alright but nothing special. The shrimp were quite small$LABEL$3
Service was great$LABEL$1
Not bad but not great either.  I tried the lobster roll and the bloody mary which we were informed as we walked in the Roland's was \""famous\"" for.  Both were good but nothing spectacular.  I was also here quite some time ago and remember them having good pizza though.One thing to note is that they have a really large selection of beer both on draft and in bottles.$LABEL$3
We wanted to eat there today. Waited for about 10 minutes at the entrance. No hostess coming up. Then she shows up saying that she will be back in another second. After additional 5 minutes we ask her what's going on. She did not apologize and says that it will take another 30 minutes. Really??!! Not the nice way to treat a party of 4 wanting to spend some money.$LABEL$1
Last weekend my mother and I headed down to the strip to get some weekly goods - lunch meat and cheese from Penn Mac - veggies at Stans - needed some new spices from Penzeys for a chili I was going to make that day....we were both a little hungry and knew we wanted to have a snack before shopping.We parked in front of Roland's and see the sign: Famous for Lobster Rolls and Bloody Mary's!Perfect. My mother got the Lobster Roll$LABEL$1
Overall$LABEL$2
My boyfriend and I visited on a Saturday afternoon. We tried mussels$LABEL$3
This was my second time eating at Roland's  seafood Grill the first time I had a great experience the food was excellent the service was great even though they were busy we got really good service and everything was really fresh and good this time the food was needless to say very poorly prepared the service what service we got seemed more interested and everybody but the six people setting at our table. It took a couple of tries to get refills on drinks I asked for a cup of water I didn't even get the cup of water the pasta was more like wedding soup my medium stake was almost completely pink all the way through very undercooked my nieces pasta had more onions in it then it had sauce I will never visit this place again!!! It wasn't that busy tonight but we stood there for almost 15 minutes waiting for them to get us a table. I spoke with the manager and explained my concerns to him I just can't see me spending that kind of money for the experience that I had tonight again.$LABEL$1
Meh. Clam chowder was big and OK.  Veggie sandwich had great$LABEL$2
Rough experience today - had one drink and left. Waited 15-20 minutes for service and it is not busy. When I said something - everyone wanted to blame someone else - waitress couldn't describe beer and didnt iffer to find out or sample it - brought 12 year old son a pop in a little kids cup. Waitress did apologize for cup but it was too late - chose to leave.$LABEL$1
I travel quite a bit and always enjoy great food.  I was in town on a business trip and someone recommended Roland's Seafood Grill.  I was seated promptly and given a drink and food menu.  I noticed the beer sampler and thought I would give it a try. I asked the server if I could choose the beers and she said yes.  She went on to explain nearly most of the draft beers I selected were not available as they were having trouble with their taps. I ordered a flight of beers that arrived after 10 minutes and began tasting them.  They were cold but did not taste fresh.  Next I ordered the famous \""Lobster Roll\"" which comes with fries and slaw.  It took nearly 20 minutes for my food to arrive but looked good at first glance.  The fries were plentiful and hot but greasy.  The lobster roll was served in a large piece of bread that resembled two uncut pieces of Texas toast.  It was buttered and grilled to give it a nice appearance.  The lobster inside was a small amount$LABEL$1
Stopped in on the Fourth of July for evening cocktail and small meal. From horrible service to terrible seafood...would never return. We waited a very long time for cocktails and order to be taken$LABEL$1
Hit Roland's on a Saturday around lunch. The place was packed but we got a seat in a back bar area which was nice$LABEL$3
We (3 in our party) stopped in to Roland's while in the lively and interesting Strip District. We placed our drink and food selections with the waitress. She brought our soups$LABEL$2
I have been to Rolands a few times and have not experienced any of the problems others are saying they have$LABEL$2
Poor excuse for seafood!   The place is overrated.  Good place to have drinks on a Saturday or Sunday afternoon-but that's about it.  The employees are anything but friendly. Unless you sit at the bar$LABEL$2
The wait staff looked like they were bussed in from a homeless shelter. The strange hostesses seated my party of 4$LABEL$1
We figured we'd give it a try even though the reviews weren't great.  Brother in law enjoyed his wings and the beer wasn't bad.  Bartender was helpful.$LABEL$3
I liked the bar.   The food not at all. First time here$LABEL$2
Super disappointed in this place. Came here for a paint nite they were hosting and arrived over an hour beforehand to eat. All I ordered was soup and salad in order to be quick and my friends who ordered a lobster roll and shrimp got their food within 20 minutes. 40 minutes later$LABEL$1
Went there Saturday November29$LABEL$2
Stopped in last night because we wanted to 'step out' of our usual places on Carson St.  The place was rather busy and was pleasantly warm on a cold Saturday night.  We found seats at the bar and a friendly bartender greeted us and took our drink order.  The drafts arrived right away and we requested menu's...  We ordered 2 shrimp cocktails and a calamari.  The shrimp arrived within 5 minutes and came with a small bowl of cocktail sauce with a dollop of horseradish on top.  I mixed mine as I love horseradish but my friend would have preferred it on the side or in another bowl as he isn't a fan.  The shrimp were big and fresh and delicious.  I mean- can you really mess up cold shrimp...?  The calamari took over a half hour to arrive.  It was pleasing to the eye and smelled delicious.  It had grilled onions & peppers on it with a slight spice dusted on top.  I thought it was delicious but my wife wasn't digging it.  She thought it was overcooked & rubbery.  Our friend isn't a fan of calamari so we didn't have a 3rd opinion to be the deciding factor...Then things went south...My wife went into the ladies room and came out with a straight up disgusted look on her face.  I saw her stop a waitress and after the 'chat' the waitress turned away and rolled her eyes.  Well$LABEL$3
I would give them ZERO stars if it were an option. No one came to wait on us. I had to ask the hostess to send us a waiter. We'll call him Mr. Personality because he never did tell us his name. I should have known we were in trouble when he didn't bother to write down our order. My Caesar salad came without the requested onions. My grilled salmon was overcooked. The vegetables were bland. The waiter took away my half-empty glass of ginger ale and filled it with water. He never offered us dessert. The rest rooms were filthy. I would never recommend this place to anyone.$LABEL$1
Usually I really like this place.  Stopped in after not eating all day$LABEL$2
Not bad.  Not great.  But not bad.   Excellent bang for your buck$LABEL$3
Came here for lunch and unfortunately spent about 2 hours here because the kitchen was backed up.  Luckily for us we had the time to spare.  Came down to the strip to pick up some stuff for Christmas Eve party and ended here  for some lunch.  I got the lobster roll and it was delicious.  The roll was practically soaked in butter$LABEL$3
Terrible tuxedo rentals! I went here 2 months before my good friend's wedding to get sized and order my tuxedo. The salesman who measured me did not know what he was doing$LABEL$1
If you're a coffee drinker$LABEL$4
With the return of nice weather to the'Burgh$LABEL$5
I am not a coffee person$LABEL$3
The first part in realizing that you have a problem is to admit it$LABEL$5
Great coffee and Tea selection.  Good prices for latte's$LABEL$4
I gave it a second shot. Much better. See the taste review below. When it comes to coffee places$LABEL$3
I knew it was going to be a fail as I watched the 'Barista' slopping together a latte for the customer in front of me.  I ordered a coffee of the day instead--meh$LABEL$2
This hidden gem$LABEL$4
I'd heard good reviews$LABEL$2
The owner$LABEL$1
This place is the ultimate two star. If you have a craving for a cheap gyro downtown at night in Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
I can't believe this place got a bad rating!!! Sure$LABEL$5
Decent gyros$LABEL$3
You get what you pay for. Cheap gyro combo = cheap tasting meal. When stepping into the restaurant the first thing I noticed were glass cases storing food. It had the feel of a cafeteria or at best a deli at a gas station convenient store. Not feeling adventurous I got the gyro meal$LABEL$2
I would never get another gyro from Salonika's the meat on my gyros are always cold...however I do enjoy thier bar$LABEL$3
Fairly decent gyro for the price. The other reviewers are spot on with the pita being too small...I appreciate the amount of meat and filling$LABEL$3
my falafel was ok$LABEL$3
I have eaten at Salonikas on 6th St. over a dozen times over the past three years.  I would eat here more often if it was more convenient.  To me$LABEL$4
The food can be somewhat disappointing but will sometimes do in a pinch.  The service is quick and the prices are reasonable for Downtown.  They are open late hours$LABEL$2
I like Salonika's.  I've been here a few times over the last couple months$LABEL$4
Went here before the regatta yesterday$LABEL$4
Great food$LABEL$4
This place has one of the best Gyro's around..... They are cheap and Delicious......  The only thing I wish was that they took credit/debit cards.  If you want something that is fast and well worth the money I would recommend this place..... I have come downtown just to eat here. LOVE LOVE LOVE the GYROS!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$5
I love this place. Gyros$LABEL$5
I was running out of time today at lunch and needed somewhere to grab lunch. On a positive note$LABEL$2
We were in the mood for gyros and decided to try a place we had never been to. The restaurant has been there for years but we normally go to Mike & Tony's for gyros. We both ordered the Gyro Special for $8.88. You get a gyro$LABEL$3
This place has amazing homemade crab bisque soup! My turkey sandwich was good too. Quick and loved the friendly staff.$LABEL$3
Just got a small$LABEL$2
Sorry$LABEL$1
It's hard to be drawn to this place when its in the recently updated market square but don't let the looks fool you$LABEL$3
One of my absolute favorite places to eat in Pittsburgh.  The meals are a little bit more expensive than you normally want to eat as a student (I probably spend $20-25 with appetizer and dessert)$LABEL$5
Went for lunch$LABEL$3
This place was really busy when we arrived so it seemed promising. Some of the food was good and others were sub-par.Two of us ate the gyro platter which comes with: hummus (watery) pita (store bought) gyro meat (I've never had gyro meat like this before$LABEL$2
Light Up Night.  Food has good flavor but doesn't look so hot.  If I hear about the Jackie O desert one more time I'm gonna barf.$LABEL$2
3.5 StarsChristos is a sort of charmingly run-down sort of place$LABEL$4
We love eating at Christos and have many times in the past............however$LABEL$3
Dirty$LABEL$1
This can be summed up as follows: For Greek food$LABEL$2
The food was clearly microwaved (ie the ring around the soup bowl and splatters along the sides). The fish was rubbery. The wait staff$LABEL$1
I crave the Jackie O cake$LABEL$3
Descriptive phrase: classic Greek.Christos is unassuming$LABEL$3
Christos was one of the worst experiences I've ever had while dining in Pittsburgh. They call this a Greek restaurant but they don't even have a normal gyro on the menu. My boyfriend and I decided to split the platter$LABEL$1
We were downtown looking for some place to eat before the show when I man standing outside showed us a menu. Boy$LABEL$5
This is a lovely Greek restaurant  that my husband and I just happened upon while walking downtown looking for a suitable venue to dine and drink$LABEL$3
WARNING. DO NOT GO HERE.My family was visiting my sister in Pittsburgh and we had our eyes set on a specific restaurant$LABEL$1
This place is something STRAIGHT out of a David Lynch film. It felt like I was transported to some sort of alternate reality with the help of a smiling$LABEL$1
Ordered take out from Christos.  I ordered a diet coke and it was in a cup.  THANK GOODNESS I took the lid off first.  There were HUNDREDS of large white particles in the diet coke that looked like paint chips$LABEL$1
Fettucini from a can$LABEL$2
terrible... terrible terrible terrible... funny$LABEL$2
Spag Warehouse is the best value for money in the tri-state area.... damn good food!!$LABEL$5
Service is lacking and food is mediocre. When I crave Italian this is not the first place I think of.$LABEL$2
Visited this place for the first time for a rehersal dinner. The decor is cool and varied and the place itself is quite large. There is free parking which is nice$LABEL$2
Went tonight for $4.99 rollback Wednesdays. Not very many people at around 9p$LABEL$4
Disappointed. That one word sums up our group of 15's experience at the Spaghetti Warehouse. This restaurant has been a Pittsburgh institution for so long; however$LABEL$2
.JB's parents wanted to meet here for dinner$LABEL$3
Why come to this place when you have a tasty world of Italian restaurants right at your hungry fingers in this town!The place is essentially a tourist-trap that seeks to reel in folks who are looking for a \""fun\"" looking italian warehouse (now...how would this be fun? Apparently it is to some.)Don't get me wrong...the food is not atrocious. But it certainly is sub-par. My chicken parm was quite un-tasty and seemed as if the spaghetti had come out of a can. The service was mediocre.Keep driving to Bloomfield!$LABEL$1
We have been coming here since it opened$LABEL$1
Didn't think this was possible$LABEL$1
Yes-the food is good and the portions are big.  Our waiter was very speedy and attentive.  That being said$LABEL$1
If you are in the mood for Italian$LABEL$4
Why anyone would willing go here to eat is beyond me.  I had read prior yelp reviews and I knew what I was getting myself into.  To make a long story short$LABEL$2
There has to be better Italian food in Pittsburgh -- I don't know why anyone would come here.I had an overnight field trip with my students to Pittsburgh & the tour company took us here for a murder mystery dinner show.  They had us sectioned off which was great for privacy & also since the students were loud.Their service is a hot mess!!!!  They only had 2 waiters serving our 50 person group & it was not organized at all.  Just getting our drinks out was confusing.  The waiters just came out with any drink & then asked -- anyone order this??  This is why my table sat drinkless$LABEL$1
We went here recently right before a 2-day$LABEL$2
I will always adore this place for some reason. It has a historical$LABEL$3
I walked in expecting a great experience. It has a great atmosphere. There was nothing wrong with our service$LABEL$2
Decent$LABEL$3
Whatever happened to this place?  Seriously.  I remember when you couldn't even get in the door.  Now I walk in and feel like walking right back out.Overall$LABEL$2
This was the first time my husband and I have been here. We went with my sister-in-law$LABEL$1
This place is dead$LABEL$1
I liked the food here. We got the $25 deal. Salad was good but a little dressing heavy$LABEL$4
I went to the Spaghetti Warehouse on a Sunday afternoon.   It was for a late lunch (about 2:00 p.m. when we arrived).  We were greeted by the hostess who took us to our table (which was in the trolley car).  It's a visually interesting place to dine.  However$LABEL$1
You can't screw up pasta--it would be very hard.  Only Buca di Beppo has managed to do that$LABEL$2
I wanted to like it here... in fact$LABEL$1
Arrived at 7:15 on a Saturday night$LABEL$1
It's probably been about 7 years since I actually ate in the Spaghetti Warehouse. I remembered the experience being pretty underwhelming$LABEL$3
This is a one time visit. The worst service ever. It was almost empty and twice we had to have someone find our waitress. The food was mediocre at best. The bruschetta appetizer for 4.99 had 4 tiny pieces of bread with some tomatoes on top. Not even shaved cheese$LABEL$1
It has been years sense we visited the spaghetti warehouse$LABEL$2
Came here a year or so ago to meet some friends... overall not a good experience.  There were 4 of us and I don't think one plate was cleared or drinks refilled$LABEL$2
The atmosphere was pretty cool. It really is warehouse like. Could have been better with a bigger crowd. But the food was pretty bland.$LABEL$3
Went here on a date$LABEL$3
DO NOT GO HERE! They are understaffed$LABEL$1
Im soo surprised with the food that we ate. Im from California and was excited to experience this restaurant. Especially$LABEL$2
Took two and a half hours to get our food. All our food was the thrown together in the same pan. Not worth the $55.$LABEL$1
Ordered delivery. The food showed up 2.5 hours later-which is acceptable$LABEL$1
I just can't help but love Spaghetti Warehouse! So many memories at this restaurant$LABEL$4
Worst place ever.  I took my friend there for the first time and my son.  We waited a hour for food.  The waiter got us out water not our sangria  30 min later out salads and after  another 40 min of my kid begging for his pizza we decided to go.  The reason they messed up the order.  We talked to the manager I'm assuming which didn't really care.  Said hopefully we come back because service isn't usually this bad. Never again. Unprofessional and rude$LABEL$1
Our terrible experience began with a 45 minute wait only to find half the tables empty and the table behind us being consoled by the manager after their own bad experience. We hopped this was a one off and not typical. Our waiter was prompt but very aloof$LABEL$2
We went on a Saturday night. We were told it would be a 30 minute wait...but it was likely closer to 45-50 minutes. The food is just average. Nothing special. Didn't seem handmade or anything like that. I thought they were known for their lasagna...so I got that. Blah...average.Service was incredibly slow. I don't think the waiter checked on us once.I probably wouldn't go back.Visited October 2014$LABEL$2
We went here with sixteen people. The only good thing about our visit was having dinner with a bunch of our friends. The service was pretty good to considering the large party. My wife and I got the Sicilian Sampler Appetizer and The Ultimate Feast for two$LABEL$1
Wednesday night is their special night.. Unlimited soup or salad$LABEL$3
I stopped in here with my family the day before Thanksgiving. My sister$LABEL$1
The rates here are perfectly reasonable. I have no idea if it costs women more$LABEL$5
While not necessarily an art destination$LABEL$3
Really marvelous art presented in a beautiful setting.  The gift shop is one of the best in the city.  They feature crafts from artists around the world and local.  Shows are well lit and well presented.  Downstairs are studios where they teach classes on metals$LABEL$5
There is nothing really to complain about here.  This Mortons is like most in other cities.  It's definitely for the expense account crowd.  It's fun to go to a place and to know exactly what you are in for.  I've been to Mortons all over the country and this one stacks up pretty well.  It's like most other high end chain steakhouses (Palm$LABEL$4
We ate here on a Sunday night and it was surprisingly slow. The wait staff was okay$LABEL$3
The last time I ate at a Morton's was in Houston$LABEL$5
Great place  . My favorite steak reaturant in Pittsburgh . The bar area could be bigger . The valet's were professional and quick .$LABEL$5
I know I'm a steak snob but I found this Mortons perfectly adequate. The service was just okay. We asked our waiter for a recommendation on a side dish and he not only forgot to bring it but also what we ordered!  And you think they were bottling it themselves when we asked for a second bottle of wine. The only saving grace was the chocolate mousse which was a little cup of whipped heaven.$LABEL$2
I can't wait for the day I walk away from a $120/person steak dinner feeling like I got what I paid for.  This wasn't it.$LABEL$3
I came here for my birthday dinner.  I was not impressed at all.  First off$LABEL$2
Unbelievable! We were in town for weekend and looked up the reviews in yelp for a nearby steakhouse. Service was top notch$LABEL$4
Morton's$LABEL$2
I ordered the center-cut ribeye for entree. It was delicious. The environment is nice and servers are polite. Recommended.$LABEL$5
We've eaten a number of superb meals at the Morton's in Cincinnati$LABEL$1
I love this Morton's. .the staff is great and the food is amazing..the ribeye was great and scallops wrapped bacon amazing$LABEL$5
This is definitely an old school hang out with a classic menu.   Although my steak was cooked perfectly$LABEL$2
We made a reservation and were told that seating was on time$LABEL$1
Refined$LABEL$5
Wow$LABEL$2
How this place got 4 stars when there are so many better options in Pittsburgh is beyond me.  The only thing that was noteworthy about the experience here was the price. The food was bland. Nothing to write home about. The place looks uppity$LABEL$2
Came here with my family for my fathers birthday. This place had it right from the start. Amazing menu. I had a porterhouse with lobster tail (same thing my father got) and we were both pleased! The staff was very very good and helpful. Everything we got to eat that night was 5 stars and exceeded all expectations. Cannot wait to go back!$LABEL$5
If you're not looking careful enough$LABEL$2
This review is for the Sam Bok food stand.  I found a review (kind of) for it but I feel as though it's good enough to have its own review.  PLUS$LABEL$4
They carry a good selection of soy sauces and have decent prices for bulk rice. Do note that there is a $10 minimum on debit/credit card usage.$LABEL$3
I was first introduced to Korean food my freshman year in college. It was a match made in kimchi heaven. This love affair has now extended to the Korean culture and language. Sam Bok is the perfect venue to get anything Korean cuisine related and has some wonderful Ahjummas (ladies) who will let you try out you newly mastered though limited skills at speaking Korean. I love making my own kimchi chigae - not proficient enough to make my own kimchi though. Sam Bok sells really good cabbage and radish kimchi that you can pick up anytime. It's available in several sizes. I also like their black bean sauce$LABEL$4
$3 chicken on a stick. The best value I know of in Pittsburgh and one of the tastiest things I can think of eating. Love that stuff and get it every time I'm in Pitt early enough to make it to the Strip District. They have a little table outside you can sit and eat at as well. The grocery store is alright$LABEL$5
I come here for chicken on a stick & mung bean pancakes every time I am in the Strip District. I don't know what else to say about it besides that it's awesome--everything is prepared quickly and the little Korean woman who I always see working the stand is very pleasant. I always recommend the food here to everyone I know whenever they say they're going to the Strip. It's cheap and delicious. This would be a five star rating if I wasn't considering the grocery store$LABEL$4
I am the dork-ie kid from your kindergarten  class. Who has been wearing glasses since I was 5 years old so please take this review seriously.  I know my way around a pair of eyeglasses.  Wow am  I getting old$LABEL$1
From the previous reviews that I read I know exactly who people are talking about.  I rarely give a one or two stars. The customer service here is horrible.  I feel like everything I say is wrong.  I felt rushed when selecting my frames.  They changed me $10 more than what the price was marked on the frame.  When I pointed that out I got an attitude.$LABEL$2
Edit:  A customer service representative from the central office called me and was able to arrange a refund with the manager of the Pittsburgh location. Still$LABEL$1
Ugh - so I went here this morning and while there was nothing wrong with the food (just got apple cinnamon oatmeal - review on that later) the cashier was bothering me.  I mean it's freaking 7:45 AM in the morning - just let me pay for my damn oatmeal and get to work!  There was NO ONE else in line$LABEL$2
Decent food but a little overpriced. They will make you a salad (you can choose 3 items) and a meat for $7.49.  You get a bread stick too. You can also get overpriced soup or a sandwich.  Lots of choices.  The cookies and scones and pastries are on the high end; similar to Panera.  Average tasting at best.  I wouldn't call this bakery fresh.  They are all over Pittsburgh.$LABEL$3
Ordered soup today for $5.19 and they charged me $1.19 baguette which you usually get for free with a salad. Surprised it didn't come with the soup.  Soup was decent (Chicken Noodle).  They have about 8 choices each day.  This place is a gold mine with limited nearby options outside of Qdoba and Mcdonalds and a few pizza places.  Add an iced tea and the bill is almost $10.  Crazy!$LABEL$3
You mean I can have a nice pecan roll--all 740 calories$LABEL$3
Ahh... ABP. How I wish there were less of you downtown and more of pretty much any other restaurant.I met a friend here recently for lunch. Even though I arrived a few minutes before noon$LABEL$3
This location is much better than some of the other downtown Pittsburgh locations$LABEL$3
I stayed at the Pennsylvanian for about a month in one of the Corporate Apartments.  This place is old.  I believe it used to be a hub for trains and buses.The outside looks nice but the hallways to the rooms look a little dingy.  There was mildew on the floors of my bathroom and bathtub.  The washer and dryer was old.  There was rust on some of the door hinges.  The dresser$LABEL$2
I really like this Saks. It's close to my job so I am in there all the time! Antoine takes care of me with my clothing purchases every time I am there. Tom is my guy for Bond no.9. He sends out postcards telling me about new Bond fragrances and in store Bond events all the time. He always is hooking me up with a free sample when I come in! Reshonda is my girl for all other fragrances. If I want to try something and they don't have a sample she will make me one right on the spot! Now that's service! I would give the store a 5 put the interior SUCKS! It is too small and needs a major updating. It looks like Kaufmann's$LABEL$4
Much like the rest of Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
Fair well old friend. You will be greatly missed. After being in downtown Pittsburgh for 60 years$LABEL$4
I never really shopped here because of the downtown location$LABEL$3
Don't waste your time.1- they dont sell regular paper and hardly have poster paper.2- its really hard to find any thing of use. Most things are archaic and not in a cool vintage way.3- the owner is a bitch. During park(ing) day 2010 she waited 3 hours before coming out and telling the artist \"" i find what you are doing is discussing. I dont support your tree hugger shit....\"" extraordinarily rude.$LABEL$1
I went here around noon one day in search of an ink pad$LABEL$1
I stopped in because they have knitting supplies. I immediately saw a beautiful cat (they have several in this shop). Being a owner of several cats and extreme lover of all animals$LABEL$1
Charming store with high quality items.  I've purchased business cards and placesetting cards. The staff was very attentive and detail oriented. Great customer service.$LABEL$5
Such a shame because this place has so much potential for being a cool little local business. But the owners/managers are the rudest$LABEL$1
A heavy hand touches everything at Mama Lucia's$LABEL$3
Great pricing on food! A hoagie$LABEL$4
Not worth your money.  Poor service$LABEL$2
Peppi's did not leave me peppy.  The wait for a cheesteak sandwich was just too long.  I came here after the lunch rush and still waited around 20-25 minutes.The sandwich was o.k.  I got the steak special which includes$LABEL$3
You just gotta have a Peppi's hoagie...especially on your way to a Steelers game.  The guy stands under the bridge near Reedsdale shouting$LABEL$4
I have eaten at the one on the Strip$LABEL$4
These sandwiches are amazing. They fill you up$LABEL$5
A staple of downtown work lunch. Excellent cheesesteaks$LABEL$5
I recently started working in \""Dahn Tahn\"" Pittsburgh and have started venturing out at lunch.  This week some guys took me to Peppi's and I was certainly not disappointed.  The place is totally a dive and has tasty dive food.  I had the cheesesteak and really enjoyed it.  I'll certainly be back again.  Unfortunately when I compare this place to the Oakland Uncle Sam's cheesesteak.... well there really is no comparison.  So Peppi's you will certainly do when I am down town... take your three stars and wear it proudly.$LABEL$3
Overall$LABEL$4
Peppi's rocks! Why do I say that you ask? Let me explain.. I was walking down Smithfield during my Friday lunch$LABEL$4
A good spot for a cappuccino on a Sunday morning. Expect a good crowd and enjoy sitting outside at their wrought iron chairs and tables watching the Strip activity.$LABEL$4
Wonderful selection of _Real_ espresso drinks; espressos$LABEL$4
The coffee isn't bad$LABEL$3
Best latte and cappucino's! ... Although the one from last Tuesday was a bit eh. I grab a couple bags of Paulie's Blend every time I'm back in town for my friends in Houston and they always love it.$LABEL$4
I went down to the strip last week and thought a mocha sounded great. Well I can't write a review on that drink because the employee dropped a dime in my drink. I was expecting her to offer to make me a new one since she was the one the dropped it in there$LABEL$1
The best place for coffee!!! I love everything about this place.. The atmosphere$LABEL$5
Surprisingly authentic and inexpensive Italian coffee shop in a downtown area. I heard actual Italian spoken here with a news channel from the motherland on the TV. The place was packed on a Saturday afternoon and appeared to satisfy everyone who stood inside. My espresso was just as good as those I had in Europe. Hats off to La Prima!$LABEL$4
As close as you will get to an authentic Italian cafe in Pittsburgh (or most anywhere in the U.S.).  This is one of my favorite spots in the city.  The coffee is superb$LABEL$5
Easily the best espresso I have had in town. Previous reviewers are correct - if you are used to the idea of a coffee shop that the local and national chains have given us$LABEL$5
I used to buy La Prima espresso for my Pavoni all the time so I was pretty excited to actually get a cup of coffee here.  I ordered a cappuccino.  It tasted like milk and no coffee.  I was exceptionally disappointed.  So while the place has a great reputation$LABEL$2
Pastries and coffee you can't go wrong. You'll need to get here early if craving an almond croissant.. they tend to sell out by noon. Their other pastries are delicious as well. Try the mele as well. You can wash it all down with an expresso or what I like is an expresso macchiato!$LABEL$5
I have fond memories of this place.  I was truly introduced to Italian Expresso and dry Italian snack pastries etc. Coming from small town Ohio and moved to the big city of Pittsburgh in the mid 90's I did not understand but got to know their product line.  My best friend at the time worked for LPE for about 7-8 years and traveled around to all of their Pittsburgh branches.  I have been to them all.  Hard working family owned  I have a fondness in my heart for this coffee.  Ground right when you order. I remember the friends and the family sitting out front until close on a Saturday afternoon parlare italiano in front of the store.  K sitting out front with her table of illustrated greeting cards. It was always packed on Saturday. I will probably add an addendum as I remember more.$LABEL$5
Out of 200 reviews$LABEL$1
Oh how sad. Full of younger kids who don't really know that gay doesn't need to be synonymous with slutty or bitchy. Big dance floor area$LABEL$2
Basically$LABEL$2
Everyone loves to bitch about Pegasus but I enjoy it in small doses. It's the 18+ club$LABEL$3
We used to call this place Tons of Sluts.Because pretty much$LABEL$2
I came here on a Saturday night as a birthday bash. There really weren't very many people at this club and most of the people who were here were very young guys. Hell$LABEL$3
I am so absolutely disappointed that Pegasus closed! The name has been around for so long and many people know of it$LABEL$5
I'd had a nail appointment set for several weeks - a first time customer.  Less than an hour before the appointment I got a call canceling it.  Not from the owner apologizing for the cancellation or trying to correct the situation somehow$LABEL$1
I have had several negative experiences trying to find a good salon in the last year. Today I finally found a wonderful salon with an excellent stylist. Emily was very professional and friendly while highlighting and coloring my hair. She listened to exactly what I wanted and really did a fantastic job. I am very appreciative to her hard work and would definitely recommend this salon to everyone!$LABEL$5
Worst Brazilian wax I have ever gotten. Extremely Painful and inefficient$LABEL$1
We came here to see the play \""You say Tomato I Say Shut Up!\"" and what fun we had! The stage is visible from any seat$LABEL$5
I happened upon this place for an elite event.  Would I go back...yes!   Would I be glad that I now know these little tidbits...yes!-  They serve food before the event...all of it looked good and the prices were pretty average.  -  They serve drinks at the bar out front and also provide table service; BUT when the show starts$LABEL$4
Excellent casual business lunches - salads$LABEL$4
Buon Giorno is located very close to my workplace$LABEL$3
I've never had a bad meal here. I usually come for lunch$LABEL$4
Probably the best$LABEL$3
Where I do most of my shopping. Pretty basic. Missing some Japanese groceries I would like to find but otherwise$LABEL$3
The Gist - small Chinese market good for basic frozen$LABEL$3
PROS: nice variety including freshly made tofu$LABEL$3
This store is a foodie find!  They stock lovely Asian veggies$LABEL$4
Fresh tofu towards the back is a must if you see them! Good selection of veggies and snacks. The workers could be more friendly and the environment could improve but this is the best place for Asian goods if you live in Pittsburgh. Come during the weekday or later in the day during weekends otherwise parking is almost impossible.$LABEL$3
Best Asian grocery in Pittsburgh. Went shopping for ingredients for a Korean dish I was making and they had everything. Food is fresh also!$LABEL$5
The spruced man that stands by the main register is not well mannered. I was answered about a product I was looking for with a \""AH? I DON'T KNOW! MAYBE THERE!\"" brushed me off and pointed to the isle the product I wanted was at. Don't worry$LABEL$3
What irks me about this place is the rudeness.  I know this place is located in the Strip and it's suppose to be fast paced and all$LABEL$3
Lotus Food is still my go to for cheap vegetables$LABEL$4
I go to Lotus foods for the fresh chow mein noodles and the selection of Japanese pop.$LABEL$4
I found decent prices here and I did feel a little out of my element I couldn't understand the names on their packaging. I bought some bamboo spoons for 35 cents each. I love wooden spoons for my tea.$LABEL$3
Put some time into learning how to shop this store and you will be greatly rewarded.  Excellent values all over the place$LABEL$4
This is a great Asian food store and they have a lot of fresh vegatables.$LABEL$4
This is hands-down the best Asian grocery I have visited in Pittsburgh. It is a huge store and is really well-organized so you can find what you are looking for pretty quickly. The absolute best thing about this place is the fresh tofu. Besides tasting better than the stuff from the regular store$LABEL$5
If I can give haft a star I would. Never shop at this Asian grocery since Many more open. Owner and employee alike no manners and nasty. Sorry guys it's the truth.$LABEL$1
This is our stop right after Stan's Market for all the other \""uncommon\"" fresh produce. They offer a wide variety of fresh produce including some that are unfamiliar to most Pittsburghers. Besides produce$LABEL$4
I realized today that everyone should have a good tailor!  That realization came about from a trip to the lovely LuLu....I had an adorable vintage dress I had bought in Chicago last summer that was too large in all the wrong places and I kept putting off getting fixed.  I had a seamstress friend look at it and she was even stumped by the darts on the chest and how to exactly go about fixing it.  LuLu had be try the dress on and did a few simple markings and I was on my way.  She even encouraged me to make it a bit shorter$LABEL$5
Honestly$LABEL$5
I needed a sweater rewoven and Lulu did an awesome job.  She was apologetic about being backed up wtih work$LABEL$5
we were here last Nov.2011 for my bestfriend's wedding in Omni Hotel. we needed some alteration for one of the bridemaid's gown and Ms. Lou was so accommodating to our needs. it was a rush request/work and she did a great job!! thank you so much!!$LABEL$5
The ladies here are very sweet and talented. We had 2 bridal gowns that needed a bustle and minor alterations. The prices are very reasonable$LABEL$5
As Lindsay's best friend and maid of honor$LABEL$1
I can't say enough good things about Jim Ludwig's Blumengarten.  We hired them to do the flowers for our wedding in April$LABEL$5
I'm a foreigner and wanted to send flowers to my girlfriend living in a suburb of Pittsburgh. I contacted Jim Ludwig's Blumengartens florist after finding them here. Unfortunately they didn't deliver to the city I wanted my flowers to be sent to$LABEL$5
What a great store! Dean the owner/manager was extremely knowledgeable and helpful about which backpack was best for me.  Very generous 30-day return policy and a wide selection of travel accessories as well as luggage. A must visit if you need luggage and want to support local businesses$LABEL$5
Specialty Luggage misrepresents customer service$LABEL$1
My wife and I have been shopping at Specialty Luggage downtown for years.  The staff there$LABEL$5
This is a tiny place tucked into some snazzy downtown complex. Its cheap for downtown$LABEL$4
My favorite mexican restaurant. The ingredients are so fresh everything is made to order$LABEL$5
The new Madonna's is disappointing.  A co-worker who always gives Madonna's rave reviews picked the new location for a lunch date.  He had talked about the spices$LABEL$3
I can't believe no one has written a review here yet on the good ol' Smithfield Cafe!  Maybe it's because it's been around so long and has been such a good ol' reliable that everyone just takes it for granted.  I guess I'm guilty of that too.  It's been a long while since I've eaten here.But this place has been here many years.  It looks like it's still caught in some kind of time-warp.  They have maroon bar stools$LABEL$3
Our experiences at the Smithfield were mixed. On the one hand the food was quite good (both Friday and Saturday)$LABEL$3
Food was only just ok and service was even worse.There's plenty of other places you can go to for breakfast  - even Eat'N'Park would be better but hit up a place like Ritter's instead.$LABEL$2
The waitresses are surly.  It's kind of annoying.  But the food is decent.  I especially like the spaghetti with oil and garlic.  I always forget not to order salads$LABEL$3
It has been a while since this place has been reviewed.  I'm happy to report the service isn't as ornery as some of the people experience in the past$LABEL$4
It's been a crazy week in my office$LABEL$4
Oh this place.  This is the greasy spoon that is sooo convenient it is worthwhile.  Would I travel more than 3 blocks for this place$LABEL$3
What can I say about The Smithfield Cafe....?  It is what it is.Is the decor nice? Of course not.Are the floors sticky? Of course they are.Is the waitstaff well versed in the latest culinary trends? Hell no.Do I love this little diner? OF COURSE!They've basically got some great lunchtime staples (the Pittsburgh Salad$LABEL$3
I love this place! Sure it isnt the nicest restaurant in Pittsburgh but it works for me. I usually frequent this bar when going to penguins games since it is right next to the deck I always park in. Good drink specials on game nights.$LABEL$3
This has to be the best diner setting Downtown$LABEL$5
The Adventures of Susan the Zombie on a Monday-After-Holiday morning.Susan get up.Susan get showered.Susan get dressed.Susan grab purse$LABEL$4
Walk through the door and immediately the sweet$LABEL$5
I adore Roxanne's! There are so many beautiful arrangements and terrariums$LABEL$5
J'adore this store!!!  So beautiful and filled with many inspiration pieces. Very much on the pricey side$LABEL$5
fish is about as fresh as you will find in Pittbsurgh. Andy makes waiting in line a joy. Very generous portion sizes$LABEL$4
I want to like it.  But ultimately$LABEL$2
It's really not clear what to rate for this one.  Andy or his Sushi.  Both have flair$LABEL$4
AAahhh.  Why do I have such a discordance with Pittsburgh Yelpers' opinions of sushi places?  This place is not 4 stars.  The long line -- one person$LABEL$2
Andy the Sushi Guy.  Fast$LABEL$4
I love this guy!!! I come every Sat. morn$LABEL$4
Oh Andy$LABEL$5
It really pains me to do this$LABEL$2
Andy has the best Sushi. His special sauce is what makes his sushi the best.$LABEL$5
I'm sorry$LABEL$1
My fiance and I always have a fun time when we stop by Andy's to get ourselves some sushi. I usually head down to the Strip when the weather's bad to try to avoid crowds$LABEL$3
We tried it once. The price is good.$LABEL$3
Eating at Andy's Sushi Bar was always an experience.  Probably the worst part is the long line$LABEL$4
First$LABEL$1
Seriously$LABEL$5
As of July 25$LABEL$1
Sushi Kim is one of those Korean restaurants you'll find in most N. American cities that don't have a really big Korean population. They tend to diversify into sushi as well as Korean food$LABEL$4
Went upstairs for the BBQ$LABEL$3
The food was... OK.  The spider crab roll was okay$LABEL$3
Being a Korean-BBQ lover and snob..I needed to get my Bulgogi/gal-bi fix when I was in Pittsburgh.  My search led me to Sushi-Kim.Oh how I wish it led me astray.  This was probably one of the worst tasting Korean Barbecue places I have ever been to.  The beef was not the right color and was basically bland.  The beef short-ribs were tasty but was way too tough.  I felt like I had to chew each piece 100x or I was going to choke and die.  I was not a fan of the food at all and would not recommend it to anyone.$LABEL$2
I wouldn't call this place authentic Korean BBQ. I was disappointed that the \""grill\"" at the table was essentially a frying pan. How can you even come close to delicious Korean BBQ if there is no open flame? Every other BBQ restaurant I've been to has had either charcoal or gas grill.The quality of the meats were terrible$LABEL$2
My friends from North and South Carolina were craving for sushi so the seven of us decided to stop by Sushi Kim on our way to a business reception. This restaurant is Korean operated with a wide range of Korean and Japanese dishes to choose from. Although the location seemed desolate by the time we got there$LABEL$3
This place was okay.  It wasn't great$LABEL$3
Eh$LABEL$3
First off$LABEL$2
A few friends from out of town wanted to meet at Sushi Kim for dinner$LABEL$2
Ew! Ew! Gross! I know that's not the most mature thing to say$LABEL$1
You can not pay me money to eat here again. They cannot even cook edamame$LABEL$2
Update to my previous review: I've gone here a few times since then hoping to reclaim the initial wonderful dining experiences I've had and all three times the fish was meh to bad. It makes me sad because when it was good$LABEL$3
Absolutely the worst sushi my husband and I have ever had.  It was Gross!!! I don't know why they use so much rice or why the fish wasn't cold.  You couldn't pay me to go back to this place!$LABEL$1
My family and I had the intention of visiting another restaurant in the area but they were not open of lunch so Sushi Kim was our lunch alternative. We were pleasantly greeted when we entered the restaurant and seated in a corner table. The service was attentive$LABEL$3
I'm new to Pittsburgh with a job on the North Shore. I had a craving for some Korean food and went to the place nearest my office - Sushi Kim in the Strip District that boasts both Korean food and sushi.Let me say up front - the food I received was delicious. But$LABEL$2
Meh. I would say Korea Garden in Oakland is way better...I got the spicy tofu pot and although it was spicy- that was all that I could taste! The spices were very overwhelming and I couldn't really enjoy the flavors of any of the ingredients inside! I would rather take the trip to Korea Garden down near Atwood street.$LABEL$3
Overall$LABEL$3
A group of friends and I went to try out the Korean BBQ. Apparently that is only available on the weekends$LABEL$3
Sushi Kim has long held a reputation as one of the best sushi restaurants in town. However$LABEL$2
I've been to Sushi Kim few times over the years and every time I've gone there the food and service hasn't lived to it's reputation of being one of the best Korean restaurant atleat in Pittsburgh.The food is okay.. service is mediocre and staff ... not the friendliest :)So$LABEL$2
I'm visiting Pittsburgh and I found this place online with several good reviews. It's a small family owned restaurant and had a very friendly staff. I found that there was a small number of specialty rolls that have a variety of ingredients and sauces$LABEL$4
good Korean food$LABEL$4
Hard to rate this one. The Korean BBQ is tasty (though it is the only Korean BBQ I've ever had$LABEL$3
If you're in the mood for fresh$LABEL$1
Staff are friendly. Sushi is not overpriced although the rolls could be made better. Otherwise this is a decent sushi place for a lunch once in a while.$LABEL$2
Ate here last night and it was absolutely the best meal I have had at Sushi Kim. Wife got the usual pork bulgogi and I got standar dol sut bi-bim-bap. It was unbelievably good. It wasn't because I was really hungry. It was perfect. Every single bit of both meals was perfectly proportioned and seasoned. And the side dishes were GREAT except I really missed not having sweet potato and little omelet ban chan. I will cut out Dosani and Korean Kitchen as long as Sushi Kim keeps this up!$LABEL$5
I had a lunch there once. The food is ok but it's on the pricy side. I don't think I will be back.$LABEL$2
There are much better sushi choices available.  This place is just okay$LABEL$2
Don't bother with the sushi$LABEL$1
Being Korean and my kids and I visit all the Korean restaurants when we are out of town.  Since my daughter goes to PITT we wanted to treat our daughter to Korean food.  My family including my wife who is non- Korean always order    and if this is how they want to represent Korean food to others they are doing disservice to our heritage.   was the worst I have ever had.  Their  had lettuce as one of mixing choices and their meat was hamburger meat?  Will not go back.$LABEL$1
Pittsburgh is not known for its Asian cuisine$LABEL$3
One of my favorites in the Burgh for almost 20 years.$LABEL$4
I am sorry to say that this place still STINKS.  I work in the strip and often get temped by Sushi Kim.  I stopped in for lunch today and I was the only person in the whole place.  That should have tipped me off.  The last time i was there i had a bad meal$LABEL$1
I don't give 2 stars that often but sorry Kim - you were a bitter disappointment. I was excited to have found a Sushi place in Pittsburgh in walking distance to my apartment. That excitement didn't last for too long when I entered the place on a Monday evening at 7pm$LABEL$2
I didn't have the awful experience some had here based on prior reviews$LABEL$2
I cringed when I saw that their BBQ buffet price went up to $24/person$LABEL$4
Last time I was here was about 3 years ago. I have been avoiding this place since the recent reviews have been very mixed.  Today I was in the mood for BulGogi and my friend wanted sushi.  So at Sushi Kim we arrived.  I have never been here for dinner$LABEL$3
Went here for the ayce Korean bbq. I'm from LA where KBBQ is kind of a religion$LABEL$3
SeasonTicketHolder:  Like too many other undiscovered$LABEL$4
We are so lucky to have such an amazing theater community in Pittsburgh.  This unique theater adds so much to the mix!  It's a fantastic theater because they focus on plays$LABEL$5
Just saw \""God of Carnage\"" it was well acted and funny. A good night out. Don't expect a resolution but do expect a good time.$LABEL$3
I can't remember the last time I was here before I saw a show last week as part of the Mix at Six series that the PPT hosts.  It's a young professionals event that serves light appetizers and drinks prior to the show.  Networking starts at 6 pm and the show starts at 8 pm. As for the venue$LABEL$4
For many years$LABEL$2
I'm a huge fan of these weekly alternative periodicals. Unfortunately the City Paper has all but vanished from the scene$LABEL$2
The location is nice$LABEL$2
Great place to get a drink on the deck and watch the river traffic$LABEL$2
Totally underrated by the Yelpers!I freakin' LOVE Redfin Blues.  I'm kind of glad it had a low rating previously to keep y'all away while I was living in Pittsburgh!  The only reason I'm even reviewing it now is because I have moved away and I'm not at risk for losing my table to a Yelp reader.  Also$LABEL$5
Pittsburgh has a shortage of riverfront dining$LABEL$1
Great location! Love biking through here and stopped for drinks a few times. I have to say the service and some of the guests give off snobby vibes. Good wine list$LABEL$3
Better than some reviews.  Guess it depends on the night.  Went late evening after kayaking on the river.  Sat outside and waited....Waitresses both thought it was the other's table.  After that$LABEL$3
After reading old reviews I figured that some change had to have occurred over the last year and gave it a shot. Went with my boyfriend after biking along the north shore trail$LABEL$2
Awful service$LABEL$1
Ate this yesterday and was very impressed with the atmosphere and scenery$LABEL$2
Had a very pleasant lunch here on a Sunday. Not busy$LABEL$4
I love the location$LABEL$2
It has all been said before--it's a great place to settle in for a beer.  The night I was there a couple of guys were performing music.  We had the wings--I would not call them memorable.  Again$LABEL$3
The only reason I really go here is when I'm on my boat and get hungry$LABEL$3
In the warmer months it's always nice to be by the water so a couple of friends and I checked this place out recently.  The food was so-so.  I got the seafood pizza and while there was a decent amount of crab and shrimp$LABEL$3
The only reason anyone goes to this restaurant is to sit on the deck and drink.  I want to like this place so badly I keep coming back and hoping that it'll be awesome and it just never is.  Like dating someone who is very very hot but also very very stupid$LABEL$1
It's hard to beat the atmosphere of this place in the summer. It's outdoor dining is right on the river$LABEL$2
Dear Redfin Blues$LABEL$1
A little pricy for food but not too bad. Sitting above the little docks there is nice on a hot day. When they put the boats in the water it's a little noisy but entertaining. I had a fish sandwich and it was a little greasy and bland and the tartar sauce was also bland. Iced tea was good. This is not the place to come to have a good meal$LABEL$2
Completely chill environment. I pretty much always get the chicken quesadilla which is awesome$LABEL$4
This is a really nice place to hang out during the summer and while the weather is good.  Coming from a sunny country$LABEL$3
A Pittsburgh restaurant that opens \""for the season.\""  I went to Redfin Blues with a family member recently$LABEL$4
The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river$LABEL$2
The food can be ok.. So can the service.. If you come by boat or bike make sure you are fully clothed.. They may look at you like you are nuts if you show up in a bathing suit.. For every 2 good waitresses there is 1 good.. I like the beer battered chicken sandwich.. The shrimp quesadilla had weird textured shrimp.. The peel and eat shrimp are pretty good..$LABEL$2
I have been to this place many times over the last 6 years(here visiting family) and I think because I'm so distracted with the view$LABEL$4
Great location and fun for drinks on a beautiful day. If their food quality was better it would be worth the price$LABEL$3
Most of the home furnishings in this joint were nice$LABEL$3
This store has great stuff in it and we all complemented the woman working on how great the store was when we were leaving. I was with 3 white people and 1 black person. When we left$LABEL$1
This is SUCH a gorgeous boutique -- shabby chic furnishings galore! If you're in the market for truly unique$LABEL$5
Just as I was about to give up on finding a downtown hair salon$LABEL$5
Sheer ecstatic bliss is what this place should be called! wonderful talented friendly hairdressers!  My friend and I went there for the first time today$LABEL$5
I hate to write mean reviews$LABEL$1
I've tried many different salons throughout the city since moving here 6 years ago$LABEL$5
Dan is awesome!$LABEL$5
Julie does a fantastic job. Been going to her for years. The attention to detail is tremendous and I come away with a haircut I can have confidence in.$LABEL$5
Had a mid-week lunch here recently with a client at his request. I'm going to break it down into 2 areas because I had 2 different experiences: service and food quality.Service: A++Not only was I seated immediately as I waited for my guest$LABEL$3
Had dinner here on a weeknight before taking my daughter to the nutcracker.  It was dead$LABEL$2
As a lifelong Pittsburgher$LABEL$1
AVOID EXCEPT FOR SHEER LAUGHSThis place is just textbook in terms of epitomizing what NOT to do in a \""fancy\"" Italian restaurant.  Meals are $30 a plate$LABEL$1
A friend recommended this to me$LABEL$2
This place is just a flat out joke.  Totally overpriced.  Went before a show and they gave a limited menu and tacked on the token 20% \""service\"" fee which gave them the right to provide lousy service.  First I asked for the beer they had on the chalkboard outside.  Had NO clue what I was talking about.  Finally gave up and got a Coors Lite.  Food was overpriced and less than average.  I had the Baked Scrod.  Exact same dish at Eat N Park is $8.99 and better than this $27 dish.  I would stay clear of this at all costs.  If you are going for a night of theater - opt for eating outside the city or at Sonoma Grill down the street.  I'm shocked this place is still in business.$LABEL$1
My friend and I were trying to think of a place to go last night for dinner before Mannheim Steamroller and she suggested Tambellini's. I hadn't been there for a million years and am not too thrilled with the downtown restaurant scene so I agreed. It all started when we were seated by the lack luster hostess. You could tell she either just didn't want to be at work yesterday or really hated her job. She had zero personality. Then we look at the menu. How much do you think they charge for simple bow tie pasta and meat sauce? You're probably thinking $10 or $12$LABEL$2
Since closed.  Surprise surprise.$LABEL$1
Just saw this unfinished review from a few years ago o and I see they are now closed but posting anyway. Had a weeknight dinner on a recent business trip. I really enjoy this local institution and try and stop by every time I'm in the city. The breaded zucchini is great and what they are known for. The menu is mostly traditional dishes and I've had great to good meals here but never a truly bad one. Service is always very good.$LABEL$3
Located in 5th Avenue Place downtown$LABEL$3
I'm not sure why this place isn't getting better reviews! I've been here twice over the last couple months (including yesterday)  and have been very happy each time I've gone.Caffe Amante is located on the second floor (food court) level of Fifth Avenue Place$LABEL$5
I have eaten in and had take out from Caffe Amante.  Both were pleasant experiences with decent food and service$LABEL$3
Fairly average Italian food other than the meatballs. Too many good Italian places in Pittsburgh to choose here. Interior could use an update. Beer selection below average and nothing special happening with speciality drinks.$LABEL$2
The food quality doesn't match the place at all. I think it's ok for a pub but this place is supposed to be a nice place for professional lunches. I had the chicken flatbread and the chicken was more like subway chicken! With so many options around that area I won't pick this place for lunch.$LABEL$2
Located downtown$LABEL$5
Decent pizza and calzones.  Get rid of the canned mushrooms! Crowded at lunch.  Calzones are huge!$LABEL$3
Well folks$LABEL$3
ZERO Stars.  Today$LABEL$1
The guys over at Slice (http://slice.seriouseats.com/) have a theory called \""The Pizza Cognition Theory\"" This theory states that one's pizza preferences are derived from their first truly memorable pizza experience. While our tastes may vary as we age$LABEL$3
Villa used to be really good and reasonably priced.  Ever since their facade renovation$LABEL$2
The only good thing this restaurant has going for it$LABEL$2
Meh - it's not that there was anything bad about the pizza$LABEL$2
Done with this place...  It seems every time we go there they get slower and slower.  Today we waited 50 minutes for a cheese pizza that we never got before walking out.  I complain to the guy making pizzas and he says \""you're not the only one's here\"".... Well$LABEL$1
On the recommendation of the previous reviewer$LABEL$4
Nice people & nice location. Very experienced$LABEL$4
Everyone at Salon Nuvo is a professional.  Everyone is friendly and it's a really great salon.  Chrissy has done my hair for almost 15 years (she moved to Salon Nuvo about 2 years ago) and I trust no one else to perm or color my hair.  Chrissy understands chemicals and how to maintain healthy hair.  She's a dedicated professional and has always been flexible - she let's me come in late to accommodate my work/school schedule.  And everyone I've ever referred to her has been a happy customer :-)  I'm pretty brutal on my hair (lots of heat and don't deep condition as often as I should$LABEL$5
I have been going to Salon Nuvo for about two years now. Autumn does my hair and she is amazing. I have very fine$LABEL$5
Definitely recommend this salon! I booked an appointment after having many failed attempts with other stylist that are not able to work with biracial hair. I was frustrated and tired of having the same look because of my unruly mop. I have thick$LABEL$4
I went there for Brazilian blowout . After spending around 400 bucks including tip my hair have not changed at all . They look even worse . They re-did it again to try to fix them but nothing happened. I have no complains about my stylist. She was very nice to me and looking in details but their procedure and product did not work . When I showed them results after second time after a wash they juts said thanks for stopping by. I wasted my money :($LABEL$3
The salon is so dirty we left before I let them cut me hair. The sanitizers were old and half full. The scissors and combs were a mess.  http://www.wellbuzz.com/dr-oz-beauty/dr-oz-pedicure-bacterial-infections-dry-pedicure-haircut-ringworm/$LABEL$1
Wonderful service all around. Had a few drinks at the bar before dinner$LABEL$4
Horrible service and the food is not comparable to any other Ruth Chris I have been to and I've been to them in 10-15 different cities. My rib-eye was all fat and the waitress was so snotty we wanted to throw our drinks at her. Save your money$LABEL$1
Really good steaks! The porter house is to die for! Something about cooking a steak in butter! Paula Deen would be proud! The location could be better. With all the new construction of new condos and office buildings going up now would be a great time to move! Was my favorite until Hyde Park came to town. Really good service and drinks!$LABEL$4
I took my parents here because it's one of their favorite places$LABEL$2
I came here for lunch recently and all was excellent. I come here about 4 times a year. When I do go I prepare myself by not eating red meat several days prior to going. On the day of I make sure to eat a normal but smaller breakfast. No bagels as they occupy too much space. I arrive a bit later$LABEL$5
Always amazing! My Husband and I frequent Ruth's Chris for almost every special-occasion: birthdays$LABEL$5
I loved my everything about my experience at Ruth Chris.  It was a bit expensive$LABEL$5
No matter which location I go to$LABEL$5
As early 90's rapper Tone-Loc once said \""Let's do it.\""Unless you have spent your first 20 years or so in a subterranean nuclear fall out bunker$LABEL$2
Best Steaks in Pittsburgh!!! I come here a lot for special occasions.  It is a pricy place but it is worth every penny. I had a New York Strip and it was really tender and juicy.  Definitely one of my favorite restaurants.  The service is excellent also.$LABEL$5
ok I am trying to catch up on my reviews and since coming back from vaca in great SF and I have jetlag with nothing else to at the moment$LABEL$2
I took my parents out to celebrate the Christmas season.  My mother ordered the petite filet mignon$LABEL$2
What can you say about a chain like this? Well$LABEL$3
Always top notch service and food at Ruth's Chris Pittsburgh. They have some summery specials during these cold winter months to bring you out of the post-holiday funk$LABEL$5
I'm really torn by this review. For years and years this was my favorite restarant in the downtown area. We went there last Saturday for dinner and had what I would deem an average meal at exorbitant prices. The salads$LABEL$2
Good steak if you don't get out much.  Not nearly as good as the price would lead you to believe.  Ruth's Chris will never be a Morton's or a Gibson's.  While Pittsburgh does not have a Gibson's$LABEL$2
Apparently I wasn't important enough with my lunch burger order (even though it was $16.95...) because my server did not come back to see if it was cooked medium$LABEL$1
This is the third Ruth Chris I've been to. The steak was delicious as usual$LABEL$4
Hostess: 1.0Bartender/ waiter: 2Food: 3Property: style decor ambiance: 2When did they start storing their stuffed olives in Styrofoam cups?$LABEL$2
So many people have raved about this place so I was so excited to bring my husband for his birthday. We were greeted by friendly staff and walked through the room that smelled of wonderful steak. We were seated and our waiter was very friendly and knowledgeable. Everything was fine until we got the food which was disappointing. I ordered off the special menu and had the corn chowder$LABEL$2
I have eaten at a lot of Ruth's Chris joints.  This was the only place where nothing tasted like any of them.  Apparently not part of the main chain and it shows.   Fail on all levels.  Had to send steak back twice before I just said to hell with it.  Horrible.$LABEL$2
Does not even compare to our hometown Ruth's Chris in Fairfax$LABEL$3
I read an article recently in the Post-Gazette that says to wring the most wear out of what they own$LABEL$5
Hey$LABEL$5
Miracle worker. Genius.  The guy here is amazing. This may be the best place on earth. I only recently discovered the fabulousness of having your shoes repaired instead of throwing them out. I walked in there with heels on that were so beat I was walking on metal rods (don't judge). He fixed them in about 10 minutes and they looked brand new.  Yesterday I took my most favorite pair of boots$LABEL$5
So I don't ever go Downtown because well Downtown is kind of icky. Eh$LABEL$5
Short story: the guy smeared the sole rubber all over the shaft of my boots$LABEL$1
I've been to Ullrich's twice and both times received excellent service. My first time at Ullrich's was to have the end caps of my heels replaced (for a second time). Initially I went to another repair store in Sq Hill and had them replaced -- but the replacement heels were totally wore out again within a couple months.  Went to Ullrich's to have them redone and after 6 months of hard walking$LABEL$5
I am really careful with how my shoes are handled. Every time I buy a new pair of shoes$LABEL$5
I'd like to echo the advice of another commenter: do not pre-pay.I dropped off a pair of boots for salt removal$LABEL$1
This place is horrible. The cobblers do not know what they're doing. You can get better service elsewhere for cheaper.I came to this place to get my dress shoes tapped and have rubber protection pads applied on the front half. There are logos on the bottom of the shoes and I told the cobbler to not cover the logos. The cobbler kept saying that he knew exactly what he was doing. In the end$LABEL$1
I brought my boots here to get fixed. They did a good job however the lady was extremely rude when I came to pick them up. I won't be going here again.$LABEL$2
This was a really pleasant surprise.  The normal Friday night ritual erupted last night and that is finding a restaurant interesting enough for me and flexible enough for the lady's particular tastes.  She was going to be nice enough to go to \""Dish\"" although I know it's not one of her favs'.  Mantini's also came across the radar screen.  However$LABEL$4
Great for lunch or dinner. Tables and chairs are uncomfortable but food is very great.$LABEL$3
While in Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
My husband and I went here for dinner before a movie. We loved the atmosphere$LABEL$3
Food was okay$LABEL$1
Boy do I have a few things to say about this place.  We had a large group before a theater show and I was excited to try a new place.  It's conveniently located for all downtown events.  They also have happy hour which is always nice.  Our large group was seated in a back room with two waiters.  One had about 40 years working there$LABEL$2
Have you met Frank? No? Well you'd better get on that$LABEL$4
I wish more people went to Papa J's. It has great food$LABEL$4
GREAT POTENTIAL POOR EXECUTIONI gave this place a try on Wednesday night.  Thought it would be a fun place for some tapas and drinks with friends.  Took a ground of 7 friends with me.  The drinks were very good$LABEL$1
It's an odd place -- a former brothel that's reputed to be haunted$LABEL$4
Based on the AWFUL service I received the last three times I dined here I will never$LABEL$1
I'm not quite sure what happened to Papa J's in the past year....I remember always being delighted with my lunches in the past.  When a coworker suggested this last week$LABEL$2
My girlfriend and I were staying downtown for a couple nights and wanted to have a drink close to the hotel. This was the third of three gay bars we went into that night. (we didn't even have a drink at the second one) And it was by far our favorite. Not a lot of female patroons so if you're a lady on the prowl$LABEL$4
I can't find a complaint about this place.  Drinks are reasonable.  Only ever seems to be a $1 cover.  Couches for lounging.  Pool table.  Room for dancing if you want to (no one hardly seems to).Staff is super friendly.  During Pride it is a place you can stop into to get a drink cheaper than the beer tents outside.$LABEL$5
Awesome things about Mon Aimee:a. Kind$LABEL$4
For a place called Mon Amiee$LABEL$2
Talk about sucking the fun out of what$LABEL$2
The owner and her parents are delightful$LABEL$5
Cute little chocolate shop! We sampled two of their gelatos that come in from Philly daily. The salted caramel and the fig. The fig was insanely delicious. By far one of the best I've ever had in my life. The salted caramel on the other hand$LABEL$3
I don't think I've ever seen this great a variety of chocolate assembled in one place in my life! I think Augustus Gloop might have a heart attack and die in here$LABEL$5
This is one of the hardest places to walk by when you're in the Strip and not be tempted to walk in to. If you're a chocolate lover who's looking for some variety$LABEL$4
In terms of having lots of chocolate varieties and being a fun store to explore$LABEL$3
great selection$LABEL$2
The gelato counter was disappointing.  The woman who served us told us that it was \""rated in the top 5\"" gelatos in the country and added that it was \""from Philadelphia.\""  Isn't that the same as \""not made fresh in Pittsburgh?\""  When we asked if we could mix flavors$LABEL$1
Chocolate heaven! There are chocolate bars from all over the world. And the unique wrapping makes you wanna buy all the chocolate if it didn't make such a huge dent in your wallet. Don't forget to try out their little gelato stand while you're there.$LABEL$4
I can only review the nonpareils and truffle sampler.   The nonpareils are very low quality dark chocolate and for 14.00 per pound definitely not worth it.   The truffles had two salted$LABEL$2
Soft$LABEL$5
There's nothing about this specific location that is bad.  It's the Einstein Bagels food itself.  I got a Santa Fe Egg wrap$LABEL$1
This produce stand is a wonderful resource if you're looking to eat healthy on a tight budget.  A quantity of produce that would cost $40-$50 at Giant Eagle or another supermarket will probably only set you back less than $20 here.  Recently I bought: 5 pounds of apples for $2$LABEL$4
Yay!  I'm a fan of Stan's.  Very cheap$LABEL$3
I love going to the Strip and supporting the businesses in the neighborhood but you couldn't give me the produce from this place! Yes$LABEL$2
Stan's has great prices OUTSIDE mostly because they things they have prepacked are spoiled and moldy or will be tomorrow.  Inside is just average quality$LABEL$2
The Strip disappoints me in the produce department.  This is definitely *the* place to go for produce$LABEL$3
Cheap$LABEL$2
As the saying goes...\""you get what you pay for\"". 100% true. Yes$LABEL$4
This ice cream parlor isn't just \""vintage\"" -- it's the real deal.Klavon's originally opened in the 1920's$LABEL$4
Why do people head to Klavon's?  Walking through the door is like walking through a time portal to a simpler time when people were less rushed and people were more chill.Klavon's used to be a drugstore and the original owner used to be a pharmacist first with the soda fountain as an aside.  The store was closed for 20 years until the current owners$LABEL$4
We just happened to wander in after an afternoon of exploring Pittsburgh.  What a gem!  What a lucky place to stumble in!Klavon's was a drugstore/soda fountain in the early 1900s.  All the original counters$LABEL$5
The ice cream here--the cones$LABEL$4
When I die I hope I come back as an ice cream bowl at Klavon's so I can forever spend my days covered in mint chocolate chip and watching people smile. I don't know...maybe not$LABEL$5
Worth a visit from across the country. Klavon's recalls about 100 years ago with its true ice cream soda fountain days. It's been in the same family since around the strike of 1900 when it was a drug store and turned into this sometime in the last century. The styling seems to be a better and more true throwback than even Pittsburgh itself. Who would not like this has no soul.I only sampled the hot chocolate and two types of whipped cream$LABEL$5
Klavon's is what I would imagine a soda/ice cream shop would be back in the 50's. There is a decent sized selection of ice cream flavors and concoctions but there isn't anything that's going to figuratively blow your mind. The interior is charming and has a lot of history -- just ask one of the staff and they'll happily tell you about its background as a drugstore. It also offers a selection of old fashioned candy such as candy cigarettes$LABEL$3
There are five reasons why you might want to go to Klavon's.1. You're in the Strip District anyway.2. You're interested in Pittsburgh history.3. You've never experienced an old-time soda fountain before.4. You're looking for some hard-to-find penny candy.5. You want some damn good ice cream.I went for all five reasons$LABEL$5
\""Could have bought it in a store\"" Hershey ice cream that had the crystal-y signs of freezer burn.  Totally disinterested staff included a girl that was texting when we walked in and shouting into her cell phone when we walked out.  No one gave us a bill and I had to interrupt the person at the cash register to get her to take my money.  Didn't even get a \""thanks\"" with my change.So not worth the walk that we took to get here.$LABEL$1
Mannnnn$LABEL$4
Easy 5. Authentic old school ice cream parlor with PSU ice cream ( peachy paterno etc). The ice cream soda was an outstanding ride in the wayback machine.$LABEL$5
Needs a huge makeover!We were greeted very warmly by one of the ice cream technicians.  Although we did determine that she was a bit over the top by the end of our experience.The parlor looked nothing like the pictures on this website.  The technician was telling us how it was closed and had just reopened.  It had the old time feel of a parlor back in the day but was very empty inside.  The character of the place was great but could use a little TLC.The menu was very small and hard to read and understand.  It was only posted above the counter and the ice cream technician told us to take a seat.  Good thing I am far sighted!  The ice cream technician could only take one order at a time.  She made my guest their ice cream first.  I ordered mine$LABEL$2
I miss the old Klavon's$LABEL$3
This ice-cream spot is actually a block away from my house. So that explains the frequent visits from time to time. I heard they kept the store the way it was after the new management. The style was definitely old school but I liked it. They served the ice cream behind the bar and the cash register is behind a glass case. They usually take your order when you come up to the bar or sit down at a table. You actually pay AFTER you eat.  This makes the entire process quite troublesome since the store does get filled up easily and you find yourself standing at the cash register waiting for someone to take your money. I will give them some time for the service to improve since they are new and still learning. Besides that$LABEL$3
Klavon's was a miss for my son and me. We came on a Saturday afternoon after walking the strip district. When we entered there were lots of people and and no structure for procedure in ordering. We sat at the bar and waited 5 mins or more to be acknowledged by employees who were making ice cream 24 inches away from us. Literally they kept their heads down and refused to make eye contact. Just when I was about to get up and leave a lady said I'll be with you in a minute thanks for your patience. So I decided to stay and listen to her complain to another employee about a customer who changed her order from cake cone to waffle cone. Maybe that's a thing here in PGH or just the establishments I walk into where employees openly complain about customers in front of other customers.My son only wanted a scoop of ice cream and I had a 1 scoop hot fudge sundae. Some how the total came to $7.38 for that. The ice cream was icy like the kind you would buy in those gallon buckets. Too bad. It's the kind of place that should be a treat not a 2 star review. Oh$LABEL$2
Just found this gem.  This is a great place for every ice cream lover.  Great place to hang out with friends or to go on a date.I recommend the sundaes at this place.  This is pure 50's and 60's style that isn't forced.  Staff are very friendly and patient.$LABEL$5
I had heard about Klavon's for some time$LABEL$1
Retta is knowledgeable$LABEL$5
I made an appointment 3 weeks in advance when I was texted after I leftA voicemail. It took a couple days to schedule as the woman$LABEL$1
This hotel is in a great location right next to the convention center and  is walkable to PNC Park$LABEL$4
I'd give it ZERO stars if i could. Worst customer service! My husband made an innocent mistake and confused the weekends for our trip back to his home town. We asked that we get the credit and offered to add a night to our stay. The hotel would be out NO money. But these corporate suits refused. So - they've lost a customer - a PLATINUM customer. We've given Marriott so much bloody money over the years$LABEL$1
When I checked in$LABEL$1
Ok$LABEL$2
Literally worst service i've ever received at a hotel. Was using a conference room for multiple days and had to beg snooty staff to come refill waters and clean the room. Also$LABEL$1
This hotel is well located. However the staff$LABEL$1
Despite being a Marriott-brand hotel$LABEL$2
Do no stay here if you plan to sleep before 2:30 AM. They could not care less that there is a very loud bar directly across the street. If loudness doesn't bother you than this place is fine.$LABEL$1
Great service$LABEL$4
A very good Jewish deli tucked in and amongst the small factories and warehouses on Smallman Street in Pittsburgh's Strip District. I cannot believe this place has not been reviewed yet. I guess it is a best kept secret. There were four in our party and we ordered a variety of sandwiches that ranged from a traditional Reuben$LABEL$4
I used to go to Sammys all the time for a corned beef sandwich whenever i came in town....until my mom took me to Smallman Street Deli! Best corned beef on rye...be sure to get it grilled!!! My sandwich...lean corned beef on marble rye$LABEL$5
Great deli.  Had a very good Ruben today.  Great food and friendly service.   I'll definitely be eating here again.$LABEL$4
Smallman Street Deli is interesting in that it is very polarized.  Some of the workers are friendly and amazing$LABEL$3
Yuck I have avoided this Subway like the plague. It's too bad that this location is the most conveniently on the way to my job.  I literally walk past this Subway 5 times a week.  Even at 1:15pm it's never packed there for lunch and the reason why is  because their sandwiches stink. When I say gross I mean that the standards for food are as low as the standards for cleaning. The attitude of the workers here is just pitiful. The don't care about making a good sandwich nor do they care about keeping the place clean. What a wreck. As some one who eats at Subway 3 times a week I feel entitled to my opinion$LABEL$1
I had a wonderful evening out with the hubby. We went on a Saturday  night to see Jim Gaffigan. The theater was impeccably clean and the ushers were very helpful and pleasant.  The Gaffigan show was hilarious. I was impressed with the upkeep of the theater. Every seat appeared to be a good seat.I am taking off two stars because a Captain and coke and glass of red wine cost $22.00.$LABEL$3
This theater is a beautiful example of the elegance that theaters of the past have.  The restoration was done with fantastic attention to detail and it is so beautiful$LABEL$4
As mentioned repeatedly by other reviewers$LABEL$3
First of all$LABEL$3
Great theater !!! Absolutely beautiful .. Live the seating ... Seen Book of Mormon here !!! Loved it$LABEL$5
I like coming here. Saw the Lion King. Bathrooms get crowded so you better hurry.  I'll be back.$LABEL$5
I've been here twice. Both times$LABEL$2
Giving my local businesses some loving. I frequent here & will never gives money elsewhere. There is a touch less car wash right down the street for the same prices who cleans half what this place does. I personally prefer an actual hand wash anyday. If you do come here$LABEL$5
Max & Erma's has long been a staple downtown. It's probably the closest thing to Chili's or Bennigan's down here. I got home late last night from a concert (oddly enough right around the corner at the Byham) to fix lunch for today. I had a taste for some good French onion soup (Hi Melanie!) with some melty cheese on it. Max & Erma's serves theirs in a meal sized bowl$LABEL$3
The 3 course combo is a great deal!!! Cheap filling and downtown. You even get chocolate chip cookies. Sundae bar is still in a BATHTUB- bring a party- there's room for it and no one here.. people forget about it.$LABEL$4
I had lunch here with a friend and it was good.  The hostess and bartender were great.  They great you with a smile and pleasantly wait on you.  The food is just OK.The hostess greated us with a smile and mentioned it would be about 15 minutes.  We asked if we could eat at the bar and he said of course.  We found a small booth at the bar.  On our way back we noticed that there were several empty tables available.  We found this strange and that is one reason I gave them 3 stars.We were greated by the bartender$LABEL$3
Incredibly slow$LABEL$1
Normally I wouldn't give a place like Max & Erma's three reviews.  But my husband Rick and I had taken our niece Allison and nephew Brian to the nearby Fort Pitt Museum and this is the closest restaurant that's family friendly.  Allison is now 12 and Brian is now 10$LABEL$3
Stopped In before a show at Heinz Hall.  It was not crowded$LABEL$2
I loved this place!Great selection! I ordered 6 buffalo wings I wasn't really hungry) but they were super yummy! And I loved that they gave me more than enough bleu cheese! No skimping!My boyfriend ordered the 3 course option...1. Tortilla Soup (also yummy!) 2. Burger (average.)  and a chocolate chip cookie (super yummy)!The waiter was very nice and even brought us an extra cookie! We tipped him 40%I am very impressed with the service$LABEL$4
Yes$LABEL$4
I treated my younger sister and kid brother out to dinner$LABEL$1
I had previously reviewed the Golden Palace buffet$LABEL$1
The food at this place is at best mediocre$LABEL$2
1.5 stars.  I agree with Eszter$LABEL$2
I can't tell you how bad this place is$LABEL$1
I think I'm spoiled when it comes to Chinese buffet because I live in an area with fantastic buffets. Liang's buffet is not great. It fills your stomach but that's about it. Their buffet has a smaall selection of so-so Chinese food. On the plus side$LABEL$2
Bad!!! Worst Chinese food in Pittsburgh!$LABEL$1
Dined in. Food had obviously been sitting out all day at the buffet. Lo Mien was soggy and had unidentified black grit in it.  Broccoli was clearly unwashed whenever it was cooked. Finally I ordered beef with broccoli and the meat looked pale like chicken but tasted to gamey to be chicken or beef. First time I ever wondered if I was being served cat.$LABEL$1
I was recently in some training in Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
Stopped in for a quick drink on new years eve about 3 pm . The place was empty . The bartender Chris was rude and very vulger . He made a crude sexual comment as soon as we sat down . We decided to stay for a drink anyway . After going a couple of choices we were told the bar was out of most stock . On New Years Eve ??? The Bartender kept complaining about his job and bosses for the next 10 minutes . We paid for our drinks and got up and left . Might be the strangest employee experience I had in awhile .$LABEL$1
This is always one of my favorite stops when visiting the Strip. A wide variety of party favors and Pittsburgh paraphernalia.$LABEL$5
I freakin' love this place. Anything you could possibly want$LABEL$5
Have you ever had a party$LABEL$4
What's this$LABEL$4
They charge $4 for a hot dog that is not any different from one you can get at any 7/11 for $1.  Not sure how to review it other than to say have you ever gone into any gas station convenience store in America and gotten a \""big dog\"" or whatever$LABEL$2
Solid dogs$LABEL$4
I've had fish sandwiches all over Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
Every time I come here$LABEL$1
Sammy's is well-known for it's corned beef sandwiches!  They are actually very tasty$LABEL$4
Oh Sammy's...how glad I am to reconnect. I had first sampled the famous about five years ago and hadn't had one since.  Now$LABEL$3
I like a dive restaurant as much as the next person$LABEL$2
I don't understand why this place think's it has famous Corned Beef. I can only believe it's because there are no other deli's downtown.  The restaurant/bar is a dive.  The Corned Beef is nothing great and their side dishes are nothing special.  Not worth the trip.$LABEL$2
I walked into Sammy's expecting a ny style corned beef sandwich and that is not what you get. I don't think Sammy has ever even had a good corned beef sandwich. Meat was dry under seasoned and Luke warm. The bread was just sliced supermarket bread. I hate to say it but giant eagle makes a better sandwich than this place. Don't waste your time$LABEL$1
This is a hidden secret of Pittsburgh.The restaurant is in the cafeteria of the church.  I go their for lunch.  The service is quick$LABEL$3
If you plan on getting married here please ask them what their rules are regarding wedding photography and videography before you book.  They have very strict rules here and your hired professionals will have severe limitations on where they can be and what they can do.Unfortunately I see this kind of thing all too often and the church's reason being that they want to \""preserve the sanctity of the ceremony and the religion.\""  Meanwhile guests are taking video and photos with their smart devices.  If churches$LABEL$1
Rules made by men. Check them before you book this church to get married or any other event. Their restrictions are far beyond respect and more on the ridiculous side. Stay away from this church.$LABEL$1
It took over two hours for our lunch here and it wasn't even busy.  When the food finally came it was bad.  We never received an apology.  The prices are cheap$LABEL$1
A few of my co-workers and I decided to try this place yesterday.   It was a sort of early Christmas lunch among us because I would be working off-site next week.This is a typical bar with an extensive bar-type food menu.  I opted for the soup-and-half-a-sandwich combo.  The french onion soup I had was okay$LABEL$3
St Paddy's day bar crawl first stop! So walking around the cultural district after the parade I had to come here. I had passed by when wandering around the city and it called to me with the Authentic Irish name. It was really really busy that late morning. The bar was hopping and everyone was excited to start the long days libations. It took a long time for us to get served. Most people were already in the party mode and it was our first stop. The bartender was busy I know but not incredibly happy to be there it seemed. We finally ordered a draft of Guinness and chatted away. I can't say the atmosphere had me wanting to stay so we downed a shot of Jameson to pregame for Market Square. The Shots were cheap$LABEL$3
After a long morning meeting at the beautiful August Wilson Center on Liberty Ave. My coworkers and I needed food ASAP! We decided to go right across the street to Mahoney's! It didn't look like it would be pricey or the food would be bad. As you walk in you immediately see the bar area with TVs and Bar stools$LABEL$2
A couple of us needed a place to pregame the Looney Tunes Yelp Elite Event at the Toonseum recently - Mahoney's just happened to be the closest place and so$LABEL$3
This place is great for some things and not so great for others.For me$LABEL$3
Saturday afternoon.... and not a soul in this place? We stopped in only to grab a Bloody Mary. The bartender was sort of in love with herself and claimed that she made THE BEST Bloody Mary ever! Well$LABEL$3
This is a very small Irish pub.  The set up is relatively nice$LABEL$2
Nice weather has returned to the 'Burgh so I thought I'd get out a little bit for lunch.  Hey$LABEL$3
Mahoney's is the type of place where women are accosted by the bartender as my girlfriend was this evening. Don't go!$LABEL$1
I am not digging the set up here the bar stools have arm rests which are fine  if the chair swiveled which it didn't and it was very awkward for me to get down with out the person next to be having to get up.The bar area felt cramped and made me uncomfortable. There  is apparently a small collection of dictionaries and thesauri that are keep  above the register that are in serious need of a dusty.I won't  be back soon.$LABEL$2
After a work happy hour a few doors away$LABEL$1
Not for vegetarians but I stopped and had a cocktail anyway on a sleepy$LABEL$3
Went here for lunch today and the Reuben was delicious.  The sweet potato fries were not$LABEL$3
Excellent food$LABEL$5
I love to try new places when traveling and my wife was interested in something \""mild.\""From their menu on the web it looked like Mahoney's Restaurant had a good selection of American favorites.The restaurant was close to our hotel so we walked over and go there about 5:30 pm on a Thursday.  It is a bar with larger dinning room$LABEL$2
Terrible. The food they brought us didn't match what was on the menu. They brought out a different wine then we ordered and didn't tell us until we ask. They messed up out bill. They didn't accommodate for a member of our group that had an allergy. The beer was skanked. The soda was flat. Possible the worst restaurant I was ever in.$LABEL$1
Worst experience at a restaurant ever.  I don't need anything fancy but this was pathetic.  My coke was colored water$LABEL$1
Let me start by saying that I am NOT a coffee drinker$LABEL$3
no. no. no.  $5 credit card minimum.  no bathrooms . . . and you sell coffee? good brew but why bother having tables if you don't have a place for customers to go?$LABEL$2
I'm not a gourmet coffee fan.  For the most part I think gourmet tastes like dirt$LABEL$3
First I want to say I LOVE coffee & I don't even understand the people writing reviews on here that DON'T drink or like coffee!!!!  So please look at the reviews of actual coffee lovers!!   I LOVE the Fortunes Coffee's.  We don't live there but stumbled into this place while walking down the Strip District.  I bought their Pumpkin Spice coffee & brought it to my son's house there to brew.  It was AWESOME!  So I had to go back & buy plenty more of both reg & decaf.  Now everytime we go back to Pittsburgh we have to go there & stock up.  If you want good tasting coffee$LABEL$5
a really interesting space for intstallations.  I've only been there a few times$LABEL$3
I visited this gallery during a PA trip in August and forgot to add my inaugural visit's review. Why add it now? More people need to know about this gallery.Art spaces that stimulate on intellectual and emotional levels are far and few$LABEL$5
The gallery is right above the Wood Street T/Bus Station and can easily be missed$LABEL$4
My husband and I have used Amtrak to get from Pittsburgh to Chicago and we have also used it to get to Altoona$LABEL$4
A disappointing Amtrak station.What's really sad is that passenger rail has degraded so far in this country$LABEL$2
Wow.  What a difference a few years makes.  Back in the late 90s$LABEL$4
This review is for Amtrak's \""Pennsylvanian\"" train$LABEL$3
This Amtrak station is in need of a face lift! It is very dingy and outdated looking$LABEL$2
This is a review for the AMTRAK CAPITOL LIMITED train route between Pittsburgh and Chicago.Riders beware. This is  a nightmare and a completely unreliable mode of transportation. Norfolk Southern owns these tracks. Unbeknownst to the lay traveler there has been delays BOTH ways on this route for the past 2 to 3 months.  Freight cars get preference. 7 mile stretch in Indiana with only one track.  Delay was 6 hours going to Chicago and over 7 hours coming back. The staff are trying to do their job but seems like the situation is out of their control. Amtrak fails to let customers know realistic arrival time. Terrible experience$LABEL$1
This place was horrible. Did not$LABEL$1
I've been eating here for 10 years or so$LABEL$3
Unbelievably bad! If the roach crawling up the wall doesn't scare you away the terrible fried rice will. The egg rolls have only cabbage in them. The \""chicken\"" is dark$LABEL$1
Did not enjoy my meal what so ever.The staff was cold and the seating area was dirty. The place was more of a hole in the wall then I can appreciate. Cheap but your getting what you pay for in quality.$LABEL$1
If a place downtown isn't busy at lunch time then either you're much more wise than the hundreds of thousands of professionals OR the place stinks.  Fu Lai is the later.  The food was gross and I usually wouldn't say that about a place.  My General Tso's seemed to have been previously frozen and I think I got 100% gristle.  I don't shriek at the sight of MSG$LABEL$1
Worst Chinese I've had in Pittsburgh. I ordered pork fried rice.$LABEL$1
The preparation was fast and the price was very reasonable but it doesn't make up for the fact that everything had a bad$LABEL$1
I live downtown & I LOVE Chinese food. Living down here it's been wonderful having the ability to have things delivered other than pizza. SO... my fianc\u00e9 & I order from here often enough that I believe they know us by name practically.Everything we've ordered has been really good. Not epic good... but good.. EXCEPT their peppered chicken IS amazing good. BIG AWESOME GOOD... a must if you order from here.... it's basically the best thing they have on their entire menu.. I'm pretty sure that's totally accurate. I order online mostly but when I do call in an order - the person who answers is always nice - easy to understand. The delivery person is always smiley & super nice too.One time they forgot our steamed dumplings - I called & told them the problem... the person came back & delivered them within a few minutes of the mishap & was super apologic & really sweet.I know this place has gotten some rotten reviews over some time but it's very easy to do that as people don't always give the happy reviews when they're pleased typically.SO$LABEL$5
Ok for a quick lunch$LABEL$3
Stopped by Mark's for a quick bite to eat last night.  Both outside and in the place looks like an ordinary$LABEL$4
Stamoolis Brothers is one of the Strip District storefronts$LABEL$3
Great place. I prefer the cheese here over Penn Mac any day! Plus$LABEL$5
I went to the Strip to buy cheese for a few recipes I was going to try.  Since this was my first time buying cheese in the strip$LABEL$4
I stop here every time I am in the Strip.  Authentic Greek grocery.  Do not pass up their stuffed grape leaves or the freshly made Babaganous & hummus.  They have great cheeses and a variety of dried lentils and spices.  You will find something delicious here$LABEL$4
A great Mediterranean food store. I was impressed by the quality and low price of the bulk spices. If you're having trouble finding a spice in Pittsburgh$LABEL$4
Some of what they have is good$LABEL$2
I wish I lived close to this store. Unfortunately we don't have anything like this in the Phoenix area.I could write a ton of stuff about their selection. Wonderful choices$LABEL$5
A decent enough dry cleaners$LABEL$3
Do not use this dry cleaner. The staff/owner smokes in the store. There are ash trays and packs of cigarettes lying around. I had to \""air out\"" my clothes after I picked them up from Galardi's to try to get rid of the cigarette smell. YUK!$LABEL$1
They lost my clothes and charged me for stuff I never sent.Clearly they do not know what they are doing and need to get their act together!!$LABEL$1
DO NOT GO HERE! They staple your name to your clothes because they can't handle organizing your things. Even with that$LABEL$1
Not only did they damage a sweater$LABEL$1
I used Galardi's for ~ 4 months when I first moved to Pittsburgh. I've since changed cleaners. I think Galardi offers great service for pick up and deliver dry cleaning in the downtown area. The owner is actually a nice lady; but$LABEL$1
This is a great little store.  I walked right in off the street and asked if I could have scraps of silk$LABEL$5
My mom called me so giddy on the phone today$LABEL$5
This is a Pittsburgh institution$LABEL$3
\""Hey$LABEL$5
I love your wonderful cheese$LABEL$4
I will never buy any type of Italian sausage at Giant Eagle again because now i know what real sausage tastes like.  And$LABEL$5
This place was noted as a \""must visit\"" location during my last trip to Pittsburgh. I must say$LABEL$4
Simply amazing! They have everything! I especially love the cheese selection and bulk olives. The Penn Mac sauces are delectable and a quick fix on those lazy days when you don't feel like making your own$LABEL$5
Have been a regular here for several years. They have a great selection of cheeses$LABEL$2
First impression upon entering the store (2/5) : \""What the heck is that smell?!\"" After walking into the store a little further$LABEL$4
I hit the Strip District about one weekend a month$LABEL$4
Penn Mac is a fun shopping experience. I used to do a lot of my weekly shopping here$LABEL$4
The restrooms looked like after an bombardment$LABEL$1
My family and I have strong ties to Pittsburgh despite living in the Akron$LABEL$5
One star off for the veggie section.  Stopped here during a recent trip to Pittsburgh: wound up buying a reusable tote to bring goodies home to Boston.  The cheese shop? To. Die. For.  We need one of these in Boston. So much yumminess in such a little space!!!Great range of olive oil$LABEL$4
How can you not love Penn Mac? There are so many good things about this lovely little gem of a place. If you're a foodie$LABEL$4
A required stop on every visit to the Strip. Best selection of Pasta$LABEL$5
LOVE this place!!  They have everything authentic Italian you could want without being in Italy!  Got some Gouda$LABEL$5
This is about as real and authentic as Italian food shopping gets.  In a very rare instance (rare for me at least)$LABEL$5
Just one of the best for cheese and olive oil!  Spices$LABEL$4
I just love to visit this store. As you enter the store you can feel the Italian vibe. We purchased the best olive I have ever had. I discovered fresh mozzarella yum! I just made the homemade pasta for dinner. The black pepper linguine was so good. I need to go back for more real soon. It is a great place to find wonderful gifts for all occasions.$LABEL$5
A must-see in Pittsburgh. As a West Coast dude$LABEL$5
This is Italian heaven.  It has everything the Italian Pittsburgher could want.  I've since moved away from Pittsburgh but recently was sent some Penn Mac merchandise and it was a dream!  They package everything so well and ship it quickly!  I couldn't have asked for a better and tastier gift.  The store is perfection$LABEL$5
Have been going to the Pennsylvania Macaroni Company for years. Love their fresh pasta and great selection of cheeses. Always great service$LABEL$1
Unlike many historic theaters across the country$LABEL$5
After two visits to this theater this week$LABEL$2
I like little indie theaters like this.  (WARNING: If you want big comfy seats$LABEL$4
Charming$LABEL$3
Our in-laws suggested Dr. Battle and company when our dog$LABEL$5
Ok yes I almost never give a business 5 stars. But this one deserves it. My pup has been going to this hospital ever since I got him$LABEL$5
so$LABEL$2
I decided to try this place after reading on Yelp how good it is.  This is no Mike and Tony's or big greek gyro in Market square.  I won't be back.  They only take cash. The workers are not Greek chefs and are very condescending.   The gyro sandwich for $5 was OK at best.  They threw some tomatoes on it. The sauce could be better.  The fries for $2.50 were undercooked.  I asked for ketchup and was told to find a table with a bottle.  We are talking a plain bottle with mystery ketchup. It was definitely not Heinz which is a sin in Pittsburgh!   I had to hunt silverware and straws.  You would think they would give them to you with the meal.  They charge about $2 for a drink with no free refills.  They put a sign that said refills are 50 cents and if you take one without paying you are stealing and subject to prosecution.  You can also get a drink from their cooler for $1.  They are no-name juices or water like you might find in a dollar store for 25 cents or less.  Tables were not very clean.  I was surprised at the number of patrons.  This place is definitely regularly visited. They have daily specials$LABEL$2
I absolutely love this place! They have some of the greatest gyros I have ever had. However$LABEL$5
I always enjoy coming here for lunch.I love that Zorba's has specials everyday- I usually come on Thursdays for the Gyro Special. The gyro is good and they are very$LABEL$4
We ran into here after trying to find this sandwich shop called Sammies. Yelp said it was on smithfield near 4th but It must have closed because all we found was a 7/11 and subway. We found Zorba's on the corner and considering how cold it was neither of us felt like walking to search for food.  We stumbled in here after reading the outdoor menu mentioning specials. The hubby  ordered the buffalo chicken salad which is the special on Wednesdays. I went with the gyro salad which came with a side of pita bread. The hubby's salad was huge$LABEL$3
The food is decent most of the time$LABEL$3
So we were walking down Penn$LABEL$5
Kicks. Butt.Prestogeorge is a family run roastery on the Strip District that pumps out some interesting and fun flavors.  They have an incredibly wide selection of flavors to please anyone.  Their tea selection is QUITE impressive! While they dont have as many fair trade options as I hoped for$LABEL$4
I've had coffee and tea in the north and south$LABEL$5
Rows and rows and rows of coffee. It's pretty overwhelming for a non-coffee drinker. But if there's a wonderful staff$LABEL$4
We rotate our coffee purchases between here and La Prima.  It's a tad overwhelming if you don't know what you're looking for$LABEL$4
Customer service is lacking and parking limited but to be expected in the Strip... Irish creme hot chocolate was surprisingly tasty$LABEL$3
This is$LABEL$5
Their coffee and tea are the best in the burgh! I love watching the coffee roasting in the back. Also$LABEL$5
Ehhh..  For a sort-of-celebrity chef Lidia Bastianich (business partner to Mario Batalli) I was totally UNimpressed with the sunday brunch.  Thank god I haven't bought her cookbook.I ordered the Pasta Tasting - and I wish I hadn't.  The whole wheat Paparelle was sugary$LABEL$3
Enjoyed the decor here$LABEL$3
This restaurant has remained - longer than I expected$LABEL$3
I liked the decor of the place.  When I lived in Pittsburgh 3 years ago$LABEL$4
I really want to give this place a good review$LABEL$2
I go to Lidia's once a year when I am in town for Thanksgiving. I like the ambiance and the decor$LABEL$4
I've been here twice and both times did the prix fixe pasta tasting. The selections change frequently but it was always delicious and extremely satisfying.$LABEL$4
My husband and I had the pleasure of dining at Lidia's on Thanksgiving day.  The food was good.  No Butterball turkey here!  Staff is friendly and we were seated right away.  The waiter timed it perfectly on each course.  We weren't rushed or did we have to sit awhile between each course.  Great wine flight!  The ambiance is lovely and the tables weren't close together.$LABEL$4
If you like the Olive Garden$LABEL$2
came here for the weekend brunch. really good$LABEL$5
Lidia's is an upscale Olive Garden with slightly better wine list.The biggest problem?  Everything is bland. They have a salt problem. They must not have it in their kitchen. Everything needed it.The salads were the only fairly good items we had. The arugula salad with pear walnuts and Gorgonzola was well dressed$LABEL$2
Arriving at the midpoint of the lunch hour we were surprised to find the restaurant less than 1/4 full.  With the bar empty and only one section being seated be claimed our reservation and were led quickly to a table near the large glass windows - an excellent view of the river would be our companion throughout the meal.  Meeting our waiter$LABEL$4
When the bookends of your meal are the only strong points then you aren't going to score strongly in my book.  The salad was very good as were the breadsticks and bread with sea salt on the top.  As for the main entrees that my girlfriend and I had...let's just say they left a little to be desired.  The pasta trio sounded good until I heard that almost everyone had mushrooms in it.  Lidia's is definitely that italian restaurant that is trying too hard to be cutting edge.  Why not go with some standard italian dishes?  Their menu doesn't include really any.  My girlfriend tried to play it safe with the lasagna bolognese and they should have just called that a mountain of over-salted meat.  There couldn't have been more than two sheets of pasta and two tablespoons of sauce in that dish.  There is nothing worse than dry lasagna and if my girlfriend wanted to eat just meat she would have ordered just meat.  Lasagna does in fact call for pasta.  I ordered the halibut with polenta.  I'll start with the polenta.  Basically I should have just eaten my napkin because that had more flavor than the polenta.  The dish came with San Marzano Tomatoes$LABEL$2
Just about my fave restaurant in the burgh.You can't go wrong at Lidia's$LABEL$5
During a recent roadtrip to Pittsburgh our party of three found ourselves tired and ready for something delicious for dinner with the caveat that it had to be walking distance from our hotel. We consulted Yelp and decided to try out Lidia's for dinner. The place is located on the fringes of the Strip and has nice clean feel to it. That's about as good as things got for me personally. The service was not very good. We were seated and ignored for about 15 minutes although the dining room was almost empty. A bread basket was placed on the table$LABEL$2
Get the pasta trio$LABEL$4
Fine Italian dining at a reasonable price and by reasonable$LABEL$4
Let's see....an Italian restaurant in Pittsburgh in the heart of the strip named after a woman with her own Italian cooking show? Should be great$LABEL$2
Review would be 4.5 for food and 2 for service. Great pasta trio$LABEL$3
I was really excited to go to Lidia's while in Pittsburgh for work.  Had some drinks at the bar and they have an extensive Italian wine list.   Our service was a little delayed but once our waiter was available he was knowledgeable and continued to check on us. He was a little awkward but attentive.  The mussels were a little \""fishy\"" to my taste but the remaining dishes we ordered were great and so were the bread bowl options.  I enjoyed a gnocchi special.  The pasta trio is typically the recommended choice but I wasn't in the mood for what was prepared that day.Overall I would give it a B.$LABEL$3
I went here on a crowded saturday night with a large party (8 people at our table.) I ordered the spicy calamari. It was not spicy. It was overcooked$LABEL$2
I want the pasta trio in ma' belly now! It's hands down the best dish you can get there. Three deeeeliscious pasta's served to you in a never ending skillet! What other wimpy pasta's can compete with that? The OG (short for Olive Garden) doesn't hold a spaghetti noodle to this place! I swear you to you I haven't seen the same noodle twice here. They always seem to serve up a dish with some crazy looking pasta that they say the name of and I can never remember. But obviously the best thing about it is the sauce! Oh$LABEL$5
After finding a babysitter for the night$LABEL$3
Being a huge Bastianich fan$LABEL$4
Alright$LABEL$3
I was very disappointed with my meal here. I expected way more from Lidia's. As a regular viewer of the show I was expecting fresh / rustic Italian meals. What I ended up with was stuffed pasta that I'm 95% sure was reheated in a microwave$LABEL$2
WAAAAY over priced and although their appetizers were good$LABEL$2
I was really looking forward to Lidia's.  And was really disappointed.  Bread was good. The cocktails were good.  The service was attentive and friendly (just don't get between a server dishing out the unlimited pasta and a hungry customer who clearly hadn't reached their limit with the unlimited servings).  Too bad the food wasn't good.  The beet salad was underwhelming.  I had the calamari which was rubbery and swimming in a tasteless chicken broth and white beans.  I felt even more sad for my dining companion who had such fond memories of the calamari.  I suspect such positive memories are no longer :(My other dining companion had the osso bucco which was dry and stringy.  Another disappointment.   And thus my rating of Meh. Which is a huge shame.  But life goes on...$LABEL$2
Oh Lidia's!  How you've forsaken me!  I came here with a group of friends after having talked up the calamari entree.  Three out of five of us got it (the others had the osso buco and a pasta dish - the osso buco was good$LABEL$3
Get the daily pasta special.. Can't beat it. Skip salad and dessert-won't have room$LABEL$4
Very good.  Great atmosphere for a date or special occasion.  The Pasta trio is always great.  On Sunday they offer family style for $25(Salad$LABEL$4
Ok$LABEL$4
This place had horrible service. I waited (sitting at the bar non-the-less) for about 10 minutes before the loser bartender got me a drink and a menu. The food was weak$LABEL$2
We were at Lidia's for an early dinner before seeing a show.  They have a great wine list and our server made some excellent suggestions.  The food was wonderful.  Several of us had the Pasta Trio.  This is a sampler dish with three different pastas prepared and served at your table.  Afterwards$LABEL$4
Three of us had dinner here during a little getaway trip to Pittsburgh. The decor was a bit more impressive than the service and the food were. Not that they were bad. They just didn't quite meet my expectations.First$LABEL$3
Yummy! The braised duck gnocchi were out of this world! Our waitress was as nice as they get. Great experience!$LABEL$4
Had dinner here on a Saturday night. Actually$LABEL$3
More like 3.5 after being at Salt of the Earth.  But Still - Lidia's is one of the few restaurants on mine and Jordan's list$LABEL$4
I'm a fan of Italian food. And I'm willing to pay for good Italian food. Not that Lidia's isn't good. It is. But I've had better for less $$$LABEL$3
I've never understood the hype of this place.  The food is simply OK$LABEL$3
I have been to all of Lidia's restaurants in Manhattan$LABEL$3
I've been to Lidia's a few times before and figured I'd leave a review after today's trip.  We arrived a bit early for our reservation and they were able to seat us right away.  Even with a fairly packed dining room$LABEL$4
as a big fan of Lidia's$LABEL$5
I went to Lidia's this past week for dinner with a group of 6 friends. The service was one of the worst I have ever had. The waitress was rude to us from the minute we didn't order alcohol to the second we signed our bills. We politely asked at the time of placing our orders if it would be possible to have separate checks. It's a group of people having dinner together$LABEL$1
My guests and I had a pleasant meal with good service.$LABEL$4
I'm a big fan of Lidia$LABEL$3
The NY restaurant is much better.  We were eating here often$LABEL$2
Overall this was good Italian food if you're ready to venture into something more asventerous than Olive Garden.  I had the pasta trio and thought the ravioli was amazing.  Everything else was pretty good$LABEL$4
soooo disappointing!  i watch lidia on tv and have a lot of her recipes.  also$LABEL$2
My family had been planning to go to Lidia's for a while$LABEL$2
One word; gross. This is not Italian food - it's Pittsburgh italian food. The ravioli is not fresh - how difficult is it for a restaurant to make fresh ravioli? The decor is tacky. The wine list is lacking. I could rip this place apart after only one disappointing meal$LABEL$2
3.5 stars for brunch. We had reservations at 11:30am on Sunday for 5 but Lidia's was not overly crowded. Wide open space with tall ceilings. Servers were friendly and did not push us out after we paid our bill$LABEL$3
I am reading through these reviews and wonder if we went to a different Lidia's Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
I've eaten plenty of less-than-delicious Italian food$LABEL$2
Portions are huge! Try the gnocchi! We started off at the bar while we waited for the other half our group. They had fried chickpeas sitting out on the bar which were absolutely delicious. Once our party was all there and we were seated$LABEL$3
Empty room$LABEL$3
Not a place I'd return to for regular fare$LABEL$4
We absolutely LOVED this restaurant!  The service was impeccable!  I had the all you can eat pasta trio which was lovely and delicious!  My husband had the cacciatore$LABEL$5
As a lover of pasta--I love to eat it$LABEL$4
My girlfriend REALLY hyped this place up but I ended up spending $110 on a terrible meal I couldn't even eat. I ordered the Chicken Marsala (Waitress's favorite) and it was disgusting. The sauce was VERY over powering and it was drenched in it. If that wasn't bad enough the Chicken was cheap dark meat with the skin and the bones on it. I ended up leaving even though our meals included a dessert with the price. Won't be going back here...$LABEL$2
Had brunch there yesterday.  Phenomenal!  Staff that we encountered were friendly and knowledgeable$LABEL$4
The food here is decent. It's a big place with great service that gives you the Italian family-style atmosphere you would desire. However$LABEL$3
We can here for brunch on Sunday$LABEL$4
I was excited to come here on a semi-recent trip to Pittsburgh visiting sister and brother-in-law. I'm sorry to say$LABEL$3
Nice place would give atmosphere a 6 1/2 out of 10 and food a seven out of 10.  Often has good specials!$LABEL$4
I visited Pittsburgh for the weekend and was excited to try Lidia's since I have been to  her son's outstanding restaurants up in New York.Lidia's was a major disappointment for me. Decor and service were just fine$LABEL$2
Had dinner here with my wife and another couple.The food was good$LABEL$3
I've been a huge fan of Lidia Bastianich for years$LABEL$5
Lidia's is a good restaurant for Italy food.  Though there is little bit loud$LABEL$4
We visited for brunch last Sunday. It was amazing. It is $28 a person and includes a prefix menu. You get a morning cocktail$LABEL$5
I'm not sure why people like this place so much.  The wait was long$LABEL$2
What you need to know$LABEL$3
Stop here on a visit to Pittsburg . Was surprised by how great the food was . Coming at brunch was perfect as the anti pasta bar was filled with olives$LABEL$4
I've had some excellent meals here when there were 3 or 4 of us.  I've had two group functions that were  way less than wonderful. I would not entertain having an event for any more than 4 people.  Even 10 people taxed the staff!$LABEL$2
Went here for an early Valentine's Dinner last night. The service was great. We both ordered the pasta trio and the waiters' were very attentive at filling up our plates as soon as they neared empty. We also got the Polito appetizer to start and it was delicious- mix of octopus$LABEL$4
Great food and service$LABEL$5
I had dinner at Lidia's on Saturday evening$LABEL$3
What an embarrassment. Rotten/black  salad greens. A server with a black eye. Pedestrian \""signature\"" pasta. Plates and glasses left uncleared. Greasy$LABEL$1
I don't mind paying high prices for great food$LABEL$3
Had Pollo Al Limone and Pasta Trio$LABEL$3
We finally made it to Lydia's and unfortunately it was disappointing! The olive spreads that come with the bread basket were gritty and tasteless. The lasagne I ordered was flavorless as well. The pasta in the lasagna was a nice texture. My husband ordered the $42 steak$LABEL$2
Went yesterday after my daughter's college graduation.  When the grad ceremony ran longer than expected$LABEL$1
Not impressed by this restaurant.  Ordered the pasta trio$LABEL$1
Food Good overall$LABEL$3
Only average at best and when you figure in the slow service$LABEL$2
Having basic cable for a few years now$LABEL$4
Great Restaurant with great food nice wine. The inside ambience is good but there's no nice view of the city.$LABEL$4
pasta was OK. Not the best not the worst. Wasn't thoroughly wowed...$LABEL$3
A restaurant that has gone steeply downhill...It's been roughly 2-3 years since I have been to lidias$LABEL$2
Oh yum!!!After a VERY stressful week this week Lidia's was a wonderful oasis on a Thursday night. Our server (Robert) was a breath of fresh air in his knowledge and love of food.HAVE THE BURRATA!  No$LABEL$5
What a disappointment. When the water glass cracked in my hand as the server poured and soaked us$LABEL$1
We were so looking forward to the food but our experience was awful. The restaurant is too large with modern decor with hideous red plastic/leatherette chairs but at lunchtime it had no character. There was no background music. The waiter was young and inexperienced. It seems that now that Lidia is famous she is no longer involved in the cooking  so the food is like any larger chain or worse without the quality control. Table cloth was dirty$LABEL$2
Since I just became a member yesterday$LABEL$3
Lidia$LABEL$1
SETTING:Nice environment that was able to cater to groups of all sizes$LABEL$2
Service was excellent.  The menu offerings were spotty.A group 16 of us attended the Saints-Steelers game in November.  We attend most of the away games and have an opportunity to eat at some very good restaurants.  Lidia's was a place I was looking forward to because I am aware of her by reputation.   We had several appetizers including the bruschetta$LABEL$2
I had really high expectations for this place but the food was overpriced & bland my lasagna tasted like it was made by Stouffers. The service was excellent the food nothing great.$LABEL$1
This place is pretty poor and really needs to get it's act together because it's a disgraceful place to watch football$LABEL$1
I think that typically sports bars are really not expected to have good food.  They just need to have four things1. ESPN2. Nachos pilled high with all kinds of stuff3. beer specials4. big screen TVs.Well Sports Rock failed on all accounts.  I was encouraged when we walked in and saw individual TVs on each table.  Of course we picked the one that didn't work!  Then we realized while there were many out of market games$LABEL$1
Having never been to Pittsburgh and in need of a sports bar to watch college football$LABEL$3
What you see is what you get.  This is a typical sports bar packed with TVs and loud noises.  There are three bars in the joint and plenty of space to be had.  There are booths with individual TVs for each booth$LABEL$3
Minimalist happy hour.  Bartenders rude (and it was slow- early in the afternoon). Ran our tab on the card to hold the check without asking if that's what we wanted to do. Chicks in bikinis on the street trying to get people to come in.  Prices too high for strip district beer.  Smelly.  Upstairs looks like it's a club at night.  Rough crowd started to come in as we were leaving.  Good for a quick beer and that's about it.$LABEL$2
When i am in town$LABEL$3
I order food for delivery at my hotel. I got the chicken carbonara.  It came with salad and toast it was the BOMB. It was delivered piping hot and it was a lot of food I ordered he individual size and its enough for two people.  I also got slice of strawberry cheesecake.$LABEL$5
The other reviews are spot on about the ambiance.  It's very frat house chic$LABEL$4
In the mood for pizza and salad so decided to try Ephesus Pizza.  I was given a menu from the hotel.  First the plus - large menu with unique items (Gyro meat on a pizza). Now the important stuff:  Lots of choices for their pizzas.  Their crust has medium thickness.  The taste:  OK but nothing great.  The salad was OK.  Delivery service was very quick.  Will not be a repeat customer.$LABEL$3
Crazy good sesame bread$LABEL$4
I only gave this place 2 stars because of the environment that it is in.  A \""hard to find place\"" is an understatement if it's dark outside and you have never been here.   I have to agree$LABEL$2
Traditional pizza is awesome. Delivery is very fast as well. They always tell me 40 minutes and then arrive in 15-20.$LABEL$5
90 minutes for two cold pizzas.....sorry at this point even a two star review is generous.While in town with friends$LABEL$2
My husband and I just moved here from the NYC area and we've been looking for a good pizza place. After trying a few different sub-par Pittsburgh pizzerias$LABEL$5
Nice place. The staff is niceDefinitely mom and pop shop. The pizza was good and the prices were a little high. I happened to try their pide because I've never had it$LABEL$3
Too oily$LABEL$1
First the bad...the amount of oil and butter used in the making of this order would make Paula Deen proud...yet.....The food was delicious!! I ordered a small cheese pizza with pepperoni$LABEL$4
Came here on a Sunday$LABEL$1
Incredible pizza. Dirty$LABEL$4
Literally some of the best pizza that I've had in the 4.5 years that I have been in Pittsburgh. I've eaten here a couple of times and I have not had a bad experience yet. The pizzas are delicious$LABEL$4
3.5 stars.  I was brought in by the claims of how large the \""RoethlisBurger\"" is by vendors and other shoppers in the Strip District and I had to see it in person.  Peppi's has a dive-y sort of place but in a good way.  The flat top grill is behind the counter in the front and the back of Peppi's has a couple tables and booths with Steelers paraphernalia on the walls.I wasn't too hungry so I ended up ordering \""The Phantom\$LABEL$3
Mushroom cheesesteak with a Stewart's root beer for lunch today. Freshly made$LABEL$4
Okay$LABEL$1
Freindly staff....good cheese....can't wait to try the aftermentioned \""#7\$LABEL$3
This is probably some of the best drunk food in the strip$LABEL$4
Went here for lunch today and it was good! I got a cheese steak with fries and drink. It's was pretty standard fries were kind of bland. I liked the cheesesteak tho! May be returning!$LABEL$3
I feel like I need a shower after I eat a Peppi's sandwich$LABEL$5
It's ok not great$LABEL$3
Wow. Stayed back in November and what a hotel! The architecture of this building is amazing on the outside and the inside. When you walk towards the elevators$LABEL$5
Great place for a party!  I had a party here last night and the banquet facilities are top notch.  We had several hors d'oevres the lamb lollipops were awesome and a must have when you have an event here.  The lobster rolls were not memorable and I'd suggest you skip these when choosing your items.  The crabmeat stuffed mushrooms were delicious.  I was very impressed with our entrees we had a filet and crabcake dinner.  I'm always a little scared with mass produced filets$LABEL$4
Very nice hotel in a great$LABEL$4
Lovely hotel experience. Great location in Pittsburgh. The staff were super friendly and helpful and were WAY nice when I left my phone charger in the room after checkout. Our flight was leaving hours after we checked out and they locked up our bags. Went to a wedding here and the food was great and all the facilities were well maintained. I was delightfully surprised.$LABEL$5
We stayed here on Xmas eve 2009.  We got a great river view corner king room.  Which was pretty easy to do$LABEL$3
Easter Brunch. One word sums it up Outstanding. The food was great. Not as many choices as The Grand Concours but as good if not better. The service was top notch. Their reservation schedule was well spaced. Lines almost non existent . A little pricey at 39.99 but worth the extra just not to have to stand in line at the various serving stations. Would go back again.$LABEL$5
Just spent two nights here and we thought it was very nice. Lobby is beautiful. We stayed on one of the floors hat they are renovating and it was done very sharply and with good taste. Ask for higher floors to minimize noise from outside.$LABEL$5
Right across the street from PNC Park (and many rooms offer a view of the Park)$LABEL$3
What a disappointment this hotel was! After reading the great reviews and hearing how classy and elegant it was$LABEL$3
Staying in this hotel changed my entire view on the city of Pittsburgh!  The hotel is in an extremely vibrant area and I am not embarrassed to admit that Pittsburgh is pretty damn cool.  The rooms in this hotel are clean and the staff is fantastic.  If you're driving$LABEL$4
I stayed here for a business trip and it was absolutely wonderful. The staff was beyond helpful even for the tiniest requests (like bringing me a mini bar key when I didn't want to move!). The beds are insanely comfortable and the view in both min and a coworkers rooms were gorgeous. If I wasn't going home$LABEL$5
The Renaissance$LABEL$4
Great location - make sure you ask for a view of the river.  Worth the money.$LABEL$4
I love this place.  I am getting married here in July.  I've been a hotel guest a few times and the service is just fantastic.  The staff knows exactly what to do to make it an enjoyable stay.  The breakfast on the top floor was awesome.  Can't wait until July!  Maybe I should write an update in a few months?$LABEL$5
Hotel was nice but nothing more then a 3 star. Room smelled musty and was dated. Staff was not all that friendly. Not what I expected when I booked the hotel. I will not be booking here again.$LABEL$3
This was a nice hotel.The lobby kinda gave me the heebie jeebies as it was pretty dingy and darkly imposing with everything a deep red in color scheme...The room itself was good as it was fairly large$LABEL$4
The Renaissance Pittsburgh is an excellent place to stay. The rooms are spacious. The beds are very comfortable. The staff were all very helpful and pleasant. I was here for a conference with breakfast and lunch provided. The food was good and the dining room was beautiful with an amazing view of Heinz Field$LABEL$5
This is a pretty awesome hotel. Rooms are super clean$LABEL$5
I was in town for the night on a business mission.  My co-worker$LABEL$5
This is a good hotel$LABEL$4
My husband and I decided to spend an overnight in Downtown Pittsburgh last minute. We already had dinner reservations and show tickets$LABEL$4
Good food worth waiting$LABEL$1
Good hotel. Stay here frequently for business trips. Easy walk to PNC park if you want to catch a game. Nice rooms and good service. I would recommend to anyone looking to stay downtown.$LABEL$4
The absolute loudest hotel I've stayed at in a long LONG time. Paper thin wall$LABEL$1
The potential for 5 stars was definitely there. The Renaissance is a beautiful hotel in an ideal location of Pittsburg. I was in hotel heaven when I walked into the lobby. It looked expensive and well taken care of. The customer service at check in was spot on. Laura (Lori?) was incredibly friendly and seemed genuinely happy we had chosen the Renaissance for our stay. She saw we booked our hotel through Priceline$LABEL$4
A decent hotel. Nothing outstanding. The pillows are pretty horrible. The view was nice.$LABEL$3
Our room wasn't ready at the 4:00 check-in (which should be a pretty basic goal for any hotel). However the manager made it right$LABEL$3
I stayed here at an incredibly cheap rate via hotwire. I was quite pleased with the value$LABEL$3
I stayed here at an incredibly cheap rate via hotwire. I was quite pleased with the value$LABEL$3
Hotel lobby is great$LABEL$3
I have little experience with convention centers other than this one and another one in Philadelphia. However$LABEL$3
I got to admit this convention center has a great view of the river! Most centers don't have a view at all$LABEL$4
This place is easy on the eyes...it's actually quite lovely.From a functionality standpoint$LABEL$3
Most who will read this likely don't have a choice of whether to use the convention center or not$LABEL$3
I'm going to keep this short and sweet. Err not too sweet. I live in Bloomfield near the Childrens Hospital. Took my moo moo pie on a walk down (about 25 minutes in the RAIN) to Bow Wow or whatever just to see what they were about and to kind of get a feel for what type of doggie day care this was and some general information.Not only when I came in dripping wet from the rain there wasn't anyone up front to greet me. She brushed me and my dog off when I asked her about more information. She had an attitude with me didn't really care to go in depth with me about anything. It was kind of \""We do this we do that\"" I ultimately ended up walking out on her mid-sentence. Complete waste of time. I don't usually write negative reviews but geeze if you treat animals better than you treat people fine but I at least deserve some respect.Her overall attitude was \""I don't even know you I don't even care to know you unless you want to pay for our services.\"" If that's the attitude you want to have I'll pass.$LABEL$1
No one is better at anthropomorphizing their pet than I am.  No one.  I religiously check the ingredients of the food that Gus eats$LABEL$5
Best doggie daycare in the city. We've been taking our dog here for over a year and we couldn't be happier. The staff is so knowledgeable and really cares about each and every dog. It's a good feeling to know that our dog is being watched by trained dog handlers$LABEL$5
There is no place I would trust more with my best buddy. They take amazing care of her and love her like their own!$LABEL$5
Being a Southern California boy$LABEL$3
When I think of Westins$LABEL$2
Location is ok for the downtown area. Not too impressed though$LABEL$2
I was expecting a high quality hotel from the Westin brand. What I found was a room that smelled of B.O.$LABEL$3
Although I was only there one night I was pretty impressed with this Westin. From the dual head shower to the comfortable bed and pillows$LABEL$4
I stayed here for a 2 day conference and was not overly impressed by the hotel. Westin has established a name for itself$LABEL$3
The service was good. Tony the shuttle driver was very helpful as were all the women at the front desk. I became ill while I stayed there and they sent me up complimentary room service which was a nice gesture on their part. My only gripe comes from two bills at the restaurants I ate at. I had their brunch twice during my stay and then had all sorts of complications with using my debit card. There were charges that were just incorrect on the bill which took me a couple of days and couple of phonecalls to different departments within the hotel to clear up. That was really inconvenient and a hard way to leave after having a pretty nice stay other than being sick. The staff were all friendly and helpful and the I enjoyed the layout of the room and the double headed shower. I took them up on the 'Go Green option\"" and took about 1500 starpoints with me because of this!$LABEL$3
I usually look for the westin whenever im traveling.  On my recent trip to Pittsburgh I booked this one specifially because of the close proximity it had to PnC park since I was catching a game.  Yeah its in downtown and its a huge hotel but this downtown is not really the hangout spot in pittsburgh.  Theres a couple of restaurants and I counted like three lounges after walking round a bit but none that caught my attention.  Teh hotel itself is ok not that super clean like the Aloft hotels.  The hallway carpets were stained and my bathroom was clean but outdated.  At least the bed was comfy and free of bedbugs(I check for that as soon as i enter the room a pet peeve of mine).  It's huge so whenever your trying to talk to someone at check in theres always a line.  Next time I will probably look for its sister hotel Aloft because this seems to be the better out one among the sheraton$LABEL$3
We got this hotel room via Hotwire at a great price.The location was good$LABEL$2
I stayed here a week ago and was not impressed. The staff was very friendly and informative which was really nice (in comparison to the rest of Pittsburgh). We took the shuttle where ever we went (which was a bonus). But something about the place seemed slightly unclean. The countertop in the bathroom wasn't clean around the taps$LABEL$3
We stayed here for ... (drumroll...) a CONVENTION! They had everything we needed and basic operations were quite smooth. One problem$LABEL$3
As with many others$LABEL$3
Just stayed there for a wedding...room was ok$LABEL$2
Beautiful rooms$LABEL$2
Great hotel. Close to many attractions and well maintained. Parking is a little poor though. The only reason for the 3 stars is that the Internet is abysmal at best. I thought a convention center would have half decent Internet$LABEL$3
Marginal at best for the money. The whole place really does not seem up to the standard of other Westin properties I have stayed at.$LABEL$2
Yes the beds are comfy and all that... but creature comforts aren't what merit the 5 stars.  A human does.Her name is Nasiba.  She's a housekeeper$LABEL$5
completely worthless wifi.$LABEL$1
We are packing now$LABEL$4
Facilities are very nice$LABEL$2
After looking at the hotel online I was excited$LABEL$1
Really poor service and way overpriced. You could make much better choices.They do not keep to a high standard of service.The rooms are not worth the money.$LABEL$1
I had great expectations that were sadly not met. For the price of the room$LABEL$2
I love the location of this hotel.  While I didn't stay at this hotel while there were any conventions the location of this place is great because it's walking distance to some places on Penn and not too far from the strip district.  As far as parking goes you can park at the bus station right across the street and parking overnight is a steal compared to parking off Ft. Duquesne the last time we stayed at the Wyndham (formally Hilton) by the triangle.  While there is a fish restaurant in the Westin it didn't get very good reviews so I avoided it.  Being so close to the strip district you could walk if you wanted to at least to the western portions of it.  As all Starwood chains this hotel has big comfortable beds.  Also every Westin I have been to has a bit of a modern feel to it.  The room decor is never outdated and the property is well kept.  As expected the room was very clean and it smelled very fresh as well.For downtown Pittsburgh I like this location and this hotel over some of the others I've stayed at in downtown because of the location and the convenient and affordable parking as well as the comfortable rooms and bed.$LABEL$3
I've always loved this hotel. Lovely location right by the river$LABEL$4
A classic example of a hotel that can charge whatever it wants$LABEL$3
The hotel is centrally located which made it a nice walk back from the Steelers game. It was clean and the staff was friendly. The beds weren't super comfortable. I expected the hotel to be a little nicer than it was. I think the false fire alarm at 6am was unpleasant considering I never heard why it went off in the first place. If you are a deep sleeper than forget hearing the alarm. All in all in was a decent hotel but not one I plan on staying at again.$LABEL$3
This is my 2nd stay here and since I had to unload my car at the valet and bring my own 5 suitcases to my room on a valet car I am already disappointed in the service. I actually had to get on the elevator with my own luggage with other people with this big cart. Disappointed that the Fairmont had no vacancies. Ditch this hotel.$LABEL$2
Everything was perfect about my stay here. The moment you step out of your vehicle you are greeted by friendly and helpful staff. The room was super clean and nicely decorated$LABEL$5
Valet lost my car keys and have been incredibly unprofessional! Completely unacceptable and I would warn everyone about using valet services here. Disgusted.$LABEL$1
OK$LABEL$2
Gist - 2.5-3 stars..basic institution of market square and known for their fish sandwich which is more size i think than real special taste..simple fried seafood on paper plates/beer type placeFood:* Fish Sandwich Basket - got the fish sandwich which is fried not battered which was huge as usual (note does not have any tomato$LABEL$3
Hmmmm$LABEL$3
This is one of the better places to get a simple fried fish sandwich.The atmosphere is a little wet$LABEL$3
Horrible$LABEL$1
Ice cream break!$LABEL$3
Let's face it folks--this ain't McCormick & Schmick.  It's a dive$LABEL$3
Great fast fried seafood$LABEL$4
I have only ever been to Market Square once before$LABEL$2
The Original Oyster House is a restaurant I've been intending to visit for quite some time$LABEL$3
Had an awful crab cake here with little crab in it but mostly lots of breading and filler.. Even the Phillips brand ones at Costco are better than most. And of course Eleven has the best ever. But anyways$LABEL$2
My parents and I came here after my dad had boasted about how good there food was and that he would bring his HP customers here for lunch. Upon arrival we immediately were ignored so we ended up seating ourselves. The place was unacceptably dirty$LABEL$1
Everything about this place seems very antiquated.  I wasn't impressed with my clam chowder.  There was some kind of bread component inside the clam chowder that may have been an attempt at dumplings but just tasted like soggy bread.  I'm not a fan$LABEL$2
This place helped me survive my college days in the 1960's as a commuter at Duquesne University. I would walk down Forbes Ave. after class for a fish sandwich$LABEL$3
Rhode-Islander approved!!How have I not been to this place before?  Authentic clam chowder$LABEL$4
We stopped here expecting them to have raw bar options as their name would imply.  However$LABEL$2
Sat outside one Thursday evening to have dinner. I was surprised out how cheap the food was here and how delicious it was. I had the crab cakes and I really enjoyed them. I was a bit shocked to find everything served in plastic (plastic plates$LABEL$3
Had lunch here at the OOH on a cold day in early Spring. It was a Wednesday$LABEL$2
A native all my life and  never been$LABEL$2
The good: I'll eat anything they want to batter and fry up$LABEL$4
I love crab cakes. Whenever they are on the menu I have to order it. I got the crab cake sandwich to feed my need for carbs on carbs. The crab cake tasted fine but in the end it was more filler then it was crab. When I eat a crab cake I want it to mostly be the main event filled with large chunks of crab. Sadly this one didn't do that for me.$LABEL$2
This restaurant is horrible.  The waitress was rude and tried to rush us.  The only oyster on the menu is a terrible patty of some kind.  How can you call yourself an Oyster House and not serve either fried oysters or raw???  The food overall was ok.  I would never go or eat there again!$LABEL$1
TOURIST TRAP. I found this restaurant online and my hotel room magazine. It had a pretty good number of reviews and apparently the first bar and restaurant in Pittsburgh so I added it to my Pittsburgh dinner options list. It turns out very few people in Pittsburgh or at least in our office actually knew this restaurant. It's an old$LABEL$2
The worst most over breaded oysters ever...It's a dive to boot.$LABEL$1
I ate here today for lunch and it was good. It is not a 4 Star restaurant by no means. They serve food on foam plates and give you plastic utensils. The best thing about this place is the fact that they have good food at a very good price. I dont think you will find a better deal in The Market.$LABEL$3
Only has 1 person working and serving the restaurant. Took 15 minutes to be asked if I wanted a drink$LABEL$1
Well I went here with my friends and my 3 year old daughter for a dinner. I ordered the chicken tender platter with a side of fries and we had some calamari. With regards to food$LABEL$2
I stopped in for lunch and it was busy-- about 15-20min wait from the time I walked in till I got my order$LABEL$4
Oyster shooters in a plastic cup. Looked a little dirty. Shooters just tasted like ketchup.$LABEL$1
This place is defiantly a historic site! From the floor to the table tops to the bathrooms! I love learning about the history of how places came about. Mary the bartender gave me lots of info.......oldest bar$LABEL$2
I eat this pizza all the time when downtown$LABEL$3
Average pizza. But with ten guys working - and not much business at the moment - it still took twenty minutes to get a slice of pepperoni. I'll walk across the street next time.$LABEL$2
This place is awful.  The pizza is not good$LABEL$1
PIzza Parma's decent tasting mega-big-2ft-long hot sausage hoagie was let down by the piss poor attitude of the staff$LABEL$3
Agree with Darren.I popped in to Pizza Parma for a slice of pie.     The slices were large$LABEL$4
I am really disturbed$LABEL$1
Hubby and I dropped in after a hellish morning at the Social Security office. Hubby loves pizza so we made a stop.Pizza wan't bad$LABEL$2
Food was pretty good.  I had the Greek salad and my sister had pizza both good choices here.  Staff is friendly.$LABEL$4
Late night in Downtown and nowhere to go for food? Sounds familiar? Unfortunately I can't be much of a help unless you consider the usual fast food joints and pizza a good late night snack. The Pizza Parma location on 8th and Penn does its job okay$LABEL$3
Good for a fast lunch. Had the gyro and added feta. Gyro was fine. Bottle of coke had icy slush in it.$LABEL$2
I'm glad I listened to my friend's recommendation and not some of these bad reviews. We're just in town for the night and wanted something delivered to our hotel. They said it would take an hour$LABEL$5
This place was right near the Megabus and we were hungry$LABEL$3
Looking for a quick bite to eat and a local told me this was \""the best pizza in the city.\""  I got a plain slice and a pepperoni slice. Possibly the worst pizza I have ever eaten.  This wouldn't even qualify as pizza in North Jersey.  I ate half of the plain slice because I was starving....then threw both in the garbage.  If this is really the best pizza in Pittsburgh... wow.$LABEL$1
Zero stars. Came in 10 mins before close. Female manager on duty asked for $100 in exchange for a pizza. When we refused she said she could not serve us because her employees had been working since 9am..$LABEL$1
One word to describe it$LABEL$3
If you can find the place... Avoid it.It's a tiny hole in the wall of a bar; which is acceptable$LABEL$2
A great neighborhood bar in the strip with authentic tasting Irish pub food. I'm a fan of going early (though it's so empty and lonely looking early in the day) for a brunch of bangers$LABEL$5
All the way at the far end of the Strip we finally found the best bar in the neighborhood (admittedly out of only a handful that exist).This place was charmingly well worn around the edges$LABEL$4
Harp & Fiddle is the gem in Pittsburgh's strip district.  They have several beers on tap$LABEL$5
Horrible staff! Terrible attitude and we could tell didn't want to be there.  Screwed up our bill and was visible aggravated and angry when we questioned charges.  This awful service makes us never want to return.$LABEL$1
Have you guys been here in the daylight? This place is filthy! I understand this place is old$LABEL$2
Excellent atmosphere and friendly service.   Food was great.$LABEL$4
A couple small TVs$LABEL$3
For the first time in my life$LABEL$1
Food was great$LABEL$5
This place is a blast on St Patricks Day$LABEL$2
Came here for a few beers after a bit Pittsburgh yelp event. Which was awesome by the way. It's a nice cosy neighborhood bar to have a few i think. The prices for 2 beers were nearly 20 bucks. But they were craft beers. But i was a bit surprised and taken back by the price. But I'm sure a miller is 2 dollars. he he. I didn't stay very long. We had the journey back to Beaver County. But I liked the look of this place. Would be a good place to have a nice chat with some friends on a Wednesday night.$LABEL$4
There's a reason why this place has no reviews.  It's never open...not even at 6:30 pm on a Thursday.  Even though the sign said \""Open\"" and the door was open.  I guess I was supposed to know that it was closed.  But all I got was two people screaming in my ear that it was closed like I barely understood or something.  So much for customer service.  Needless to say$LABEL$1
A nice warm escape from the Strip on a cold day. They make good hot Vietnamese soups. The real star of this place is the hoagies you get outside the restaurant though. Delicious marinaded grilled chicken stuffed in a sub that has perfectly pickled onions$LABEL$3
This is a very odd restaurant.  I was here once and probably won't be back.  The people who work here were doing a lot of screaming at each other$LABEL$2
Uggh.  I wanted pho really bad$LABEL$2
If it wasn't for the Chicken Hoagies (Banh-Mi Ga) they sell outside on Saturday and Sunday Mornings(This is the only time I think you can get it)...I wouldn't even bother wanting to revisit the experience we had at this place.So on the day we were craving the Banh-Mi Ga$LABEL$3
This is my favorite spot in Pittsburgh!!This was the first time i drank grass tea$LABEL$5
I am a huge fan of shopping off-price places like Filene's$LABEL$4
So here's my story$LABEL$2
This Burlington is always on and popping. At times I can get annoyed with this store because they never seem to have more than 2 lines opens for checking out. This Burlington Downtown has a better selection of clothes and shoes then it's sister store in North Hills.  Almost anything I need clothes and shoes wise I go to find in Burlington they also have bedding$LABEL$3
I've only ever gotten take-out or delivery around lunch time$LABEL$4
I used to really like this place$LABEL$2
This place does decent Thai food$LABEL$2
This was the single worst Thai meal I have ever had in my life.I went here for dinner with some friends after going to the PSO$LABEL$1
I'm still eat here$LABEL$3
terrible service is right.  the minute my coworker and i walked in$LABEL$1
Had dinner at Lemon Grass earlier this week. When I walked in the place was empty. Got to pick where I wanted to sit. First thing I noticed is the place was an absolute sauna. I asked my server about why it was so hot in the restaurant? She shrugged and did not seem interested.I ordered the Lemon Grass soup with shrimp and the Papaya salad. I used the terms \""Tom Yum\"" and \""Som Tum\"" when I ordered. These terms are not used in their menu - I was under the impression they were fairly standard terms for these Thai menu items. In any case - she had no clue to what I was referring to - so I used their terms.Soup came out immediately - soup was not very spicy or lemon grassy - which is ironic given the name of this place. There was a lot more tomato chunks in their version of this soup than I've experienced before. I would not order this again.Then the Papaya salad came out - just ok - not spicy and bright like a good Papaya salad should be.Water glass was refilled promptly the one time it was starting to look empty.Won't come back here again unless they do something about the lack of AC and better food!$LABEL$2
Pass.  I tried Lemon Grass for takeout and was as disappointed as many of my fellow Yelpers here.  The Pad Thai was bland and generic$LABEL$2
You pay for what you get. I thought the food was good in taste and quantity for the price. Service wasn't great$LABEL$4
Visiting Pittsburgh with my daughter$LABEL$2
Waiter was awful and food (pad thai) was not much better. Apparently letting the waiter know that your soda is flat (twice) is a huge inconvenience to him.$LABEL$1
This is by far the worst Thai restaurant I've ever been to. The servers are rude and slow$LABEL$1
Just had the panang tofu for lunch$LABEL$2
A friend of mine and I thought we would meet for lunch one Wednesday. I'm a fan of Thai food so I thought we would give the Lemon Grass Cafe a try. We arrived a little before noon and were seated promptly. That was the best part of the experience. It took an hour to receive our food. AN HOUR on a busy Wednesday lunch break. There was no sorry$LABEL$2
Stay away!!!!!! The waiters/waitresses hate you and your hapiness.$LABEL$1
Poor service$LABEL$1
Oh this place needs Gordon Ramsay$LABEL$2
It was a beautiful day in Pittsburgh today - I had to get outside for a walk in the sunshine.  I thought I'd just wander around for Thai lunch and so I ended up at Lemon Grass.  I'll probably not be back.There was just one table of 2 seated and eating when I arrived.  And$LABEL$2
This place has ok thai food.  I recently had lunch here with my boss on her suggestion that we should try this restaurant.  I ordered the chicken basil and it was ok.  I probably won't be back unless my boss really wants to go here again.$LABEL$3
This restaurant has never been great$LABEL$1
A very lovely name for a very terrible resturant. The food is bland$LABEL$1
This is a good$LABEL$3
Don't waste your time or money. Rude service$LABEL$1
This Starbucks is worthy of mention only because it moved into the lobby of the former Plaza Theater.  The Plaza is where my friends and I (legally) first saw R-rated movies on our own.  I remember seeing \""Pulp Fiction\"" here.Otherwise$LABEL$2
i go here because it's close and because i like sweetened iced coffee black.  also because i hate crazy mocha and there lack of making a simple sugar to sweeten iced drinks.  truthfully$LABEL$1
Yeah$LABEL$3
I'm not a cool kid$LABEL$2
Oh looky its your typical Starbucks. Some of the girls that work there (manager probably I think) can be a little off putting at times but otherwise good atmosphere. I always pick up the same thing whenever I go in Blueberry and Vanilla KIND! bars --- GLUTEN FREE  for all you celiac people. Otherwise Crazy Mocha fufills my coffee needs better yet Chai Tea Latte needs.$LABEL$3
This is a great place for me to stop into for a cup of Jo before heading to work in the morning. Most Starbucks around have become places of high customer turnover$LABEL$3
this place is tiny. the stage is too. there's some good bands that play there though. and a lot of local bands. the crowd size can be anywhere from like 10 people to 100+. it all depends on the bands/promotion$LABEL$3
I will start to say... The owner is not so much of a nice guy$LABEL$2
The Artworks essentially a very long hallway with a stage and a PA at one end. It is a low(200) capacity venue catering to the off-center art crowd$LABEL$3
I guess you could call this a minimalist approach. Garfield Artworks is essentially a big white room used to display art on its four walls or a venue for bands playing on a stage at the far end. There are a few chairs alone the walls and that's about it.I came here the other night to see a band. The acoustics aren't the greatest$LABEL$3
I agree with the comments posted by others.  I give it four stars because it really is a great benefit to the local community and the get some amazing bands.  I also really like how simple they have kept it.  Also agree that you need to check the website regularly.  But honestly$LABEL$4
This store is small$LABEL$4
The staff was all very nice and it was a very laid-back place. It was quite small though. Good for clothing$LABEL$2
I ate china house for dinner. I had the shrimp and broccoli in garlic sauce combo that came with pork fried rice and an egg roll. I substituted steamed rice for the fried rice. I also got wonton soup (small). The price was great! For all of that and a can if sprite I paid 10.17! And the service was prompt and the lady in the front was very pleasant! Bottom line is the garlic sauce on the shrimp and broccoli was not good at all! It was very thick to the pony of sticky. It was like an old sweet an sour sauce with a little spice. I could barely pick the shrimp out because the sauce was that gross. The portion size was nice. The wonton soup was fine. Basically I will most likely give this place one more chance with a different item on the menu because of its proximity to my house and the great customer service. Hope I have better luck next time!$LABEL$2
I visited PA in 2012$LABEL$5
try the sesame chicken or mixed vegetables w fried tofu- ask for it spicy. the owners are very nice too.$LABEL$4
i just ate half of a cockroach.  Gross.  Never going here again.$LABEL$1
China House is my new go to Chinese take out restaurant in Pittsburgh ever since yen's closed up and then changed hands. Keep in mind it's a take out place. You're not expecting to get gourmet food on gold lined plates - you're getting tasty food in plastic containers and not eating there. (There's only two tables)With that in mind it's great. Big portions and I've never been let down. Sometimes you get free stuff too. Coupons for 10% off and free soda.$LABEL$5
Appearances can be deceiving!  From the outside$LABEL$4
It was probably a nice restaurant twenty some years ago: the locale is a converted pretty Victorian with stain-glass windows; the bar area displays a disused grand piano propping up bottles of wine; the dining room still sports a pastel palette of sea foam and salmon; and framed 80's posters of the same color scheme grace the walls. The menu is marginally more updated than the decor. Some dishes remind me of food fads from the 90's (e.g.$LABEL$2
Every time I have been to Cafe Sam I have been very disappointed.  On my most recent visit$LABEL$1
Gotta say$LABEL$2
Cafe Sam has a cool Pittsburgh vibe. It's a bit funky but the food is good and interesting and their menu offers a lot of choices. I went with a group and we all had the Prix Fixe menu. It was a little bit pricey$LABEL$4
Extreemly dated on the inside- the menu was pretty broad$LABEL$4
This is the strangest place$LABEL$5
Not great. Stale bread and the food was strongly over-flavored. I had a glass of wine and was asked if I wanted another$LABEL$1
I came to Cafe Sam with high hopes.  Ritter's Diner is directly across the street and I eat there all the time.  In my mind a place can only  get better.  As our party of three walks in we are promptly seated by the manager.  Looking over the menu$LABEL$2
Huge menu$LABEL$2
The restaurant has a nice setting and pleasant decor$LABEL$2
Great experience. Staff was quite attentive and seemed to genuinely care about our experience. Allowed us to sample a couple appetizers. Most of the items we had for dinner (appetizers$LABEL$5
As much as I love the food here$LABEL$2
The restaurant operates out of a renovated brothel...my brother and I dined at the bar...which had various house infused liquors...(maple whiskey...peppercorn vodka...cherry vodka...pickled gin... Dirty vodka..others)..we ordered the buffalo chicken medallions for appetizer...which were at best average ...my top shelf long island was average....food delivery was slow and the bartender was occupied for a whoke before taking our order...the bathrooms are dated....it seems like this restaurant is catered to 50+...the dining hall was not busy but our appetizer took nearly 20 minutes to come out and our entree over 30 minutes..my snapper was average on a bed of collard greens.  ..whipped sweet potatoes average again and creamed kake was definitely average.  ..the host brought out complimentary marinated mushrooms which were pretty good after our dinner...our dessert was chocolate cake a la mode..which was a cold cake with a small scoop of strawberry ice cream on the side.  The chocolate cake again at best average...the bill came to 90 with my brother ordering the cod and a beer. I had a Bailey's on ice which was probably the best thing I ordered...$LABEL$2
We have not been to this restaurant in quite sometime. What a great lunch menu. Highly recommend checking out.$LABEL$5
One of two places to check out whenever I'm in Pittsburgh. For such a small space$LABEL$5
Paul's is my favorite record shop in town! As others have noted--it's not a big place$LABEL$5
Paddy cake bakery is a step up from the typical grocery store bakery but not by far. While many of the pastries are \""good\"" I haven't had anything from this bakery that really called me back for more. One might say there is a \""richness\"" lacking in ingredients.Many of the pastries are average price 75 cents to $1.50 for individual pastries with some items on sale for a $1 and I suspect these sale items might be a cheap$LABEL$2
I've stopped at Paddy Cake Bakery several times since moving to the East End of Pittsburgh. While the selection seems more geared towards sweet baked goods then breads$LABEL$3
This was my first visit to Paddy Cake.  I had to pick up a little something for this diabetes support group I belong two.  Yes$LABEL$4
My family has ordered from this bakery for OVER 20 YEARS- POSSIBLY 30?! Well$LABEL$2
We stopped in this morning at Paddy Cake Bakery to sample some donuts/treats/whatever caught our fancy. It wasn't the nicest place on the inside$LABEL$2
I am a huge dessert fan and love local bakeries.  My favorite thing to order from Paddy Cake are the doughnuts-love the iced sprinkle ones. I always call the day before to put my order in because they do run out of certain kinds early. It is also nice to have the doughnuts boxed up and not have to wait while you pick out the kinds you want. The staff is always friendly on the phone and my order is always correct and waiting for me.  Sometimes I stop to try a cookie-they are so tempting. The cookies are delicious and a variety of kinds are available.  The one thing I do not especially care for is their cupcakes/cake. I like a very dense cake and their cake is on the light$LABEL$3
There are two types of food that I will go out of my way to try in each and every neighborhood I spend time in. Pizza and Mexican. Last night found me wanting something within walking distance and cheap. I called over to Angelo's and the pizza was ordered. The service was fast and friendly and when I went to pick up the pizza the local hockey game was on the radio and the place was deserted. My pizza was just finishing up in the oven when I got there. For a large plain pizza it was 6$ (7.48$ with tax). This special is for carryout only!!The pizza was huge. The crust was great$LABEL$3
Support this local business.  Good food$LABEL$5
I would have to put Angelo's in the upper 10% of pizza joints here in Pittsburgh. They make you're standard medium thick crust$LABEL$4
I was skeptical about going to a typical pizza shop during a food tour in Bloomfield$LABEL$4
Sad to say$LABEL$2
I am not really certain how this place is getting the stellar reviews that it has. we just had a quick bite there last night and it was easily one of the worst meals that I have ever had the pleasure of paying for. While the people running the shop were lovely$LABEL$1
I order frame Angelo's regularly .Quality in going downhill.First I waited on hold for 10min$LABEL$1
One of the best hoagies I have ever had. Warm and toasted. Great mayo. Large serving. Soft drinks are refillable. The 1980's atmosphere is not too impressive$LABEL$5
Sometimes I like to stop into a pizza place for one slice of pizza.  I have found that the places with the best pizza have \""horrible horrible\"" individual slices.  The slices have often been sitting for a long time.  Then if the individual slices are reheated$LABEL$5
Honestly$LABEL$1
They get 1 star because less was not an option. Was told by someone at the hospital that the steak hoagies are great. Well either our opinions differ greatly on food or we just got hosed. Looked up the menu online. $9.00 for a lrg Angelo special. Think philly cheese steak. So I ordered 2 for myself and my gf. I asked for mine with well done peppers onions and mushrooms no lettuce or tomato. I get there and the total is over $24! So I ask why. I'm told \""oh yeah that's the owners fault he doesn't want to update the online website so it's a little out of date.\"" A LITTLE!?!?? Two and a half dollars more is not a little. So I leave already feeling taken but hey they are big and they feel heavy so I'm still optimistic. WRONG AGAIN! The sandwiches nearly fell out through the grease soaked bag and found my sandwich covered in grease swimming lettuce and tomatoes with pale mushrooms and uncooked peppers. Swimming I tell you swimming in grease! If I have a heart atack I'll know why. Called to complain and was pretty much told it was my fault they became greasy because I took to long to get there! And that its all the owners fault about the price. Poor food poor excuses and apparently poor ownership. The next thing that should be poor is the owner because I will NEVER eat there again.$LABEL$1
I haven't been here yet but after reading about the Bikes Before Christmas project here http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/08311/925595-94.stm I just want to go here and buy some bike stuff.More about Bikes Before Christmas here - http://iheartpgh.com/2008/11/06/donate-bikes-for-kids/$LABEL$5
Easily the best bike shop in Pittsburgh.Let me qualify that by saying if you are looking for a $12$LABEL$5
Kraynick's is a real gem for Pittsburgh.  This isn't the place to take your high-end carbon frame bike$LABEL$5
While the quality of the pizza depends on the time of day you order and the decor leaves a lot to be desired$LABEL$3
Seriously my favorite pizza in the 'burgh! The cheese mix is amazing$LABEL$4
The best pizza in Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
The pizza is good overall--not too much sauce$LABEL$4
I was in Pittsburgh since yesterday from out of town on business. Tonight was the conclusion a long day and all I wanted was to go back to my hosteI and maybe grab a bite to eat. In my haste to get dinner before I passed out$LABEL$4
I ordered a Veggie Pizza with 4 different toppings and did not really enjoy it a lot. They use some oil which smell different that killed the taste of my pizza. Also$LABEL$1
Read some reviews and decided to try them out. Im very pleased with the haircut and even more pleased with the price. Walked right in$LABEL$4
For $10$LABEL$3
Great place. Got my haircut there for the first time today. Great price too. Only negative - I wish they did a neck shave with a straight razor.$LABEL$4
I've figured Dan out - no matter what you ask for$LABEL$4
I love these kind of barbershops.  Straight out of a Twilight Zone time warp. especially  the prices.  Very friendly (Pittsburgh is a friendly town to begin with.)  Quick cut.  Very nice if what you want is basic.$LABEL$5
The last 3 or so times I've visited$LABEL$1
Mmmmm delicious pizza at a great price.I got a pie last time I was in town will defiantly be back! Service was straight forward$LABEL$4
They have really good pizza for really cheap. Bloomfield rocks!$LABEL$4
Another great day at the Bloomfield pool led me to another awesome eatery in Bloomfield. I seen a nice bunch walking out with yummy fresh pizza slices & noticed  the sign stating $1.50 pepperoni slices. Say no more! :)our pizza was yummy & we tried the pepperoni roll for $2.75. I seriously expected one of those little pepperoni house rolls from other shops (which are great btw) but nope! it was literally 10x bigger than expected. We split it & could've eaten 3 more. I don't want to hype it up though$LABEL$3
If i was rating the sandwiches and whole pizzas$LABEL$4
This is probably the best north indian restaurant in Pittsburgh (Lawrenceville/Bloomfield). A bit of a dive with a traditional menu but the food is made fresh and the prices can't be beat.  The lunch buffet is a prety good deal (much less than $10!).$LABEL$3
I have only had the lunch buffet$LABEL$2
I've only eaten the lunch buffet here$LABEL$3
I am disappointed.  I have lived in the neighborhood for over 6 years and I keep giving them a second chance (and a third).  The take out menu says in big letter on the front 15% off take out.  So we ordered again$LABEL$1
People's Indian is a solid traditional Indian place. Offerings are standard$LABEL$4
Best palak paneer. Hands down.did a palak paneer test a few years agos.. included graphs and etc... still have my heart. the spicey could be spicier.. ill just throw that out there....$LABEL$5
Cheap$LABEL$4
I've ordered for delivery a few times.  Although you get small portions for the price..the food is pretty good.  This time I and a coworker ordered 2 seperate dishes that came with rice.  They combined the rice in one container.  Why?  My coworker leaves in 10 mins with my rice....ugh!  Called the restaurant and all I get is a ...\""wellll..I don't know what I can do?\""   Are you serious?$LABEL$2
The lunch buffet? Totally worth it.$LABEL$3
I have only gone to People's two times$LABEL$3
I just wrote a bad review so I want to counter it with a good one. People's Restaurant easily wins the top slot on Kelly G's list of the best Indian food in Pittsburgh. The restaurant itself is small and no-frills (Indian shabby chic$LABEL$4
At first glance I wasn't too impressed with the buffet$LABEL$4
Hadn't been here in a few years and remembered I enjoyed it in undergrad$LABEL$1
I ordered chicken vindaloo at spice level 10 and garlic nan as take out.The chicken vindaloo was quality.  I enjoyed it.  It wasn't super spicy$LABEL$4
Very expensive and quantity was quite less. I am an Indian and I love Indian food but their food gave me hard time in digestion; I suffered for 2 days. Price-wise too$LABEL$2
local treasure. i'm in love with this place. 7 dollar lunch buffet (always a mistake unless you plan on sleeping the rest of your day) and byob. recommended!$LABEL$5
Prices are excellent$LABEL$5
It's a travesty that I haven't written People's a review yet. I may have dined in or taken out from People's over 100 times. That is not a joke. At one point$LABEL$4
A total dive$LABEL$3
Maybe I went on a bad day but the food was pretty darn terrible. The spring rolls were falling apart and only filled with noodles and a couple of sad looking shrimp$LABEL$1
So I am currently sitting here with Pho Minh's Pho tai...and I honestly have to say I am not impressed.  Its a monday and my favorite Pho place (Tram's...in pittsburgh anyway) is closed.I decided to give this place a go...and take out their pho...The broth is actually good$LABEL$2
I am really conflicted about this place.  I always have a great time when I go$LABEL$3
No way$LABEL$2
If you want PHO in Pittsburgh (Considering the Vietnamese Restaurant selections) I would choose this Place over Tram's Kitchen. The Pho here is more fragrant.$LABEL$3
First of all$LABEL$4
I had my second bowl of pho in Pittsburgh here$LABEL$2
Tram's Kitchen was closed$LABEL$3
This is my favorite type of restaurant$LABEL$4
Tram's has better *ahem* \""atmosphere\"".  Pho Minh has better Pho.$LABEL$4
I$LABEL$5
I go to Pho Minh often$LABEL$3
In sum$LABEL$4
I am a big fan of Pho Minh$LABEL$4
The last review I read said Tram's has better atmosphere. Funny that I ended up at Pho Minh for the second time because Trams had kitchen violations and was shut down. Both times$LABEL$4
Craving for some more authentic Vietnamese pho. Yelped and found this place in Pittsburgh. Drive 80 miles from Morgantown$LABEL$3
Best place for pho in the city. I have tried them all and this is the one I always come back to for more. The woman who takes your order is quick and abrupt$LABEL$5
I was expecting more meat on my pho ut it ends up can't fill me at all.$LABEL$3
Occasionally$LABEL$5
This is a vet for cats$LABEL$5
Once I learned that Dr. Bebko charged twice as much as The Humane Society$LABEL$2
A local friend who considers Dr. Bebko an extraordinarily good vet checked and was told Dr. Bebko did consult with other out of area vets and would be happy to do that with my vet on behalf of my very sick kitty$LABEL$1
Wow!  Talk about attitude on the phone!  After all the glowing reviews that I read on-line$LABEL$1
I brought my sick kitty here who was vomitting and had diahhrea for a few days and the Dr we saw was like \""so what do you want to do\"" and I was thinking well thats why I am here to ask for your professional advise. I felt like I spent $100 for absolutely nothing. I would not recommend this clinic for any legit issues$LABEL$2
The food is great. The employees are friendly$LABEL$5
I consider myself a lucky girl to live in Pittsburgh's own Little Italy (although it has taken it's toll on my waist line$LABEL$5
Best Tiramisu ever! But a sub-standard attitude? I was flying to Florida to visit my sister and wanted to gift her the tiramisu. Reached the shop 15 minutes before closing time and was treated to rude customer service. I was told that the store generally closes earlier than the closing time as there is a lot of cleaning. Well I do sympathize with that$LABEL$4
What can I say about Groceria Italiana that hasn't already been said? PLEASE OPEN ANOTHER LOCATION! The south hills needs a place like this. If I didn't live so gosh darn far away$LABEL$5
My review will be short and sweet.  I AGREE with everything everybody had to say about this wonderful little Italian store in Bloomfield.  I hate grocery shopping (especially big store grocery shopping like Giant Eagle) but love to shop in this lovely little store.  Prepared foods are fantastic and the lunchmeats are always fresh and delicious.  I always manage to find everything I need here.  I am Italian and grew up with grocery stores just like this.  I feel like I am home every time I enter.$LABEL$5
I had such high hopes. And though they clearly pride themselves in their pasta and ravioli$LABEL$2
I love this place! So far I've been there twice for pepperoni rolls$LABEL$5
Years ago I discovered this quaint grocer and their awesome lunch counter. The meatball hoagie and weeding soup are seriously are amazing and authentic. I have not had better wedding soup in the city. I'm also in love with the homemade raviolis$LABEL$5
This is a great PNC branch! Everyone is friendly$LABEL$5
A completely serviceable branch in Bloomfield. This is the closest branch to my house$LABEL$3
Love the fish sandwiches$LABEL$4
Right in the heart of Bloomfield you'll find Armand's: The Home of some Giant Monster Fish Sandwich... While I can't say anything about the fish sandwich$LABEL$3
I walked in to try the fish sandwich that I have heard so much about but decided not to stay. The smell of smoke is over powering.  If your not a chain smoker$LABEL$1
The bar reeks of smoke and the bar table feels sticky. You'll definitely feel like you're in the deepest hole in the way. The only good thing is that the drinks are cheap. But I really wouldn't recommend going there.$LABEL$1
Yes$LABEL$1
There are two Indian restaurants pretty close to each other: Taste of India and People's. People's has better appetizers$LABEL$5
Cozy and dim lighting. Food is okay - large quantities for take-out$LABEL$3
Love this place. And they have coupons too. The bonus is definitely the amount of food$LABEL$4
We ordered take-out from here through Meals Delivered and couldn't be more pleased.  The portions were large and flavorful$LABEL$4
It's nice to know that there's decent Indian food that isn't far out in the boonies like Udipi (which$LABEL$4
I had high hopes for Taste of India$LABEL$2
Great sauces$LABEL$4
That woman that you see in the corner$LABEL$5
Pretty darn good$LABEL$4
This place knocked me out.I had garlic naan and the lamb Shahajahani.  The sauce was so good$LABEL$5
Compared to other ethnic eats in Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
Jordan & I have been eating Taste of India at CMU for a while$LABEL$5
I tried to eat here tonight using a $25 gift certificate purchased from Restaurant.com.  After waiting over 15 minutes for my server to stop by for my order$LABEL$1
Darren brought me here$LABEL$5
I might have just found my favorite Indian place. I went with two friends for a feast and we were not disappointed! We were greeted warmly and told we could sit anywhere.  The space is a little small$LABEL$5
This was my first time at taste of India. The service was very pleasant and I found the food and alcoholic beverages to be quite inexpensive. Most importantly$LABEL$5
If you really know and like Indian cuisine then food here gonna be flavorless and bland for you. Tandoori chicken doesn't taste like one etc. Decor is tasteless and old. Carpet looks really dirty. I'm definitely not coming back.$LABEL$2
Not fancy but great Indian food at a really reasonable price. The eggplant was particularly yummy.$LABEL$4
So happy that these guys have finally reopened! I went there for dinner a few nights ago and really enjoyed it. I got the Tandoori chicken$LABEL$4
Went for the lunch buffet which was about $8. It was SO good! I ate wayy too much but still wanted to eat more! Everything tasted so fresh and delicious! The decor was very tasteful$LABEL$5
Comparatively mediocre to other indian restos. Not very flavorful. Naan is really thick and dense. Channa masala just tastes like it's chick peas soaked in tomato sauce instead of masala sauce. And daal makhini is similarly too saucy and not in a yummy sauce way. Kind of a bummer since there aren't many indian restaurants in the east end area. So my final thought post-dinner is \""meh.\"" And I'm not even excited for the leftovers tomorrow.$LABEL$3
Barber is really nice - the shop is cosy and seems very well maintained.I went in without an appointment$LABEL$4
Writing this review for the all the Laaadies! Mr. B Had come to town for a visit and needed a trim in October. i had passed the Golden Razor on several occasions as it is in my neighborhood. I had a really good feeling about this place even before seeing the results it yielded.We were out to run errands and walked inside. Two gentlemen were seated and a lovely man with a thick Italian accent told us he could fit Mr. B in after his next cut. The place reminded me of a small shop that would be located on a tiny street in Naples. One chair running constantly. Tom the barber is very busy and you can see that his clientele is very loyal. The appointment was quick and the atmosphere jolly. The topics of conversation revolving around Italy and current events. I felt like an interloper because I was probably one of the only chicks that ever goes in there. I could tell by the looks I got from the guys coming in. I just smiled and kept up the conversation with Tom and Mr. B. This cut was very simple but he shaped the hair just perfect and when we walked outside I gave Mr. B a kiss and told him he looked marvelous!Our second visit was mid February. Mr. B was trying to go a little longer with the his hair but it was just looking unkempt. I decided that I liked his hair a little bit on the longer side so after calling and securing an appointment this visit$LABEL$5
If there were an option to give an extra star for a \""special\"" experience$LABEL$5
The barber did a double take when I walked in. I had long hair and a beard two weeks old. He did a great job in less than 30 minutes and was very social and pleasant throughout.  The straight razor shave with all the hot towels and other treatments was particularly cool.$LABEL$5
I went as a walk-in on a random Wednesday.  Tom was busy$LABEL$5
Best Damn Haircut Ever. Grade: A+Imma be blunt: Fellas$LABEL$5
The expression 'a diamond in the rough' was made to describe Nico's. At the outset$LABEL$5
Nico's was a place I heard I should visit$LABEL$3
I'm a pretty hard core karaoke fan$LABEL$2
This will be simple...The karaoke had a very limited selection. The DJ kept fiddling with the volume while you were singing. Was way over-crowded with wanna-be hipsters who were attempting to be ironic which just made them look pathetic$LABEL$1
This has got to be one of my favorite bars in Pittsburgh.Yes$LABEL$4
This is a friendly$LABEL$5
Nico's is what it is.   It's your typical dive Pittsburgh bar.  it's the Jacks of Bloomfield.  I've never tried the food but the drinks are relatively cheap and it gets an awesome crowd that ranges from young hipsters to old yinzers.  Rumor has it that it's the #1 karaoke bar in Pittsburgh so I recommend giving it a try one Saturday night.  Whether your voice is terrific$LABEL$3
Pay attention to the bill.Curly haired male bartender intentionally added $20 of drinks to my tab. When I confronted him he blamed the extra drinks on my friends who hadn't been drinking those things in the first place.$LABEL$1
I don't understand why people love this place. I've been here a dozen times.The beer selection is decent. The prices are good.  The bar food is typical.It is just a standard bar to me.  If you want no frills beer and bar food$LABEL$2
Good prices$LABEL$3
This place has everything!  And it's cheap!  They've got a nice cheese and meat counter$LABEL$5
Donatelli's is absolutely terrific--one of those local gems that make the Bloomfield neighborhood so wonderful.  Whenever I'm in the area$LABEL$4
I was walking my small granddaughter (not yet two) and when I passed I decided to go in to pick up some shrimp for my son.  I waited quite a bit of time in line for the shrimp$LABEL$1
I *used* to think Donatelli's was a great place--they're incredibly cheap$LABEL$1
Jane is so right. The food and prices may be great$LABEL$1
Donatelli's has some of the best prices for produce$LABEL$3
Excellent prices$LABEL$3
Let's start with atmosphere:  This place is an absolute throw back.  Everyone knows each other$LABEL$3
Jeannie is awesome! If you want a true Bloomfield Italian experience$LABEL$5
I RUSHED to tan today after work. I got to Yolanda's at 7:20PM$LABEL$1
Four star food$LABEL$2
I'll start with service...  It is not very good$LABEL$3
If you wanna see local color$LABEL$2
I live right around the corner$LABEL$5
Small menu$LABEL$4
The tablecloths change every season$LABEL$5
Like a couple others$LABEL$2
Cheap$LABEL$4
Meh. I was visiting from NYC when I ate here before a show at the Brillobox. The beef pho was sub par. Food took about 10 minutes to arrive when it did the beef was already cooked through (that's a BIG no-no in my book). I could hardly make out the star anise in the broth$LABEL$2
Wow! I am so glad Miss Alison suggested this place while we were in town. She's vegan and they have plenty of options for her. We came here with friends for dinner after Day 1 of selling at Handmade Arcade. We got there just in time since it got packed shortly after we sat down. There was a slight language barrier$LABEL$4
Ok$LABEL$5
Tram's has slipped a bit!  I went a few days ago$LABEL$3
I'm pretty much a pho expert.  Maybe not certifiable$LABEL$4
Pittsburgh doesn't have many Vietnamese options. Tram's Kitchen is the only place I've ever heard people mentioning. Today I've finally visited it. First impression: solid pho.  The soup had a good flavor$LABEL$3
If you have been to any other PHO restaurant$LABEL$1
I am also somewhat conflicted about Tram's.  I have been a few times now$LABEL$4
This place isn't much to look at$LABEL$4
I'm Vietnamese and I grew up eating Vietnamese food everyday.  Let me tell you$LABEL$2
Good place to find Pho in Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
For many people in Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
I didn't care too much for the atmosphere because most hole in the wall sort of restaurant are authentic & non-Americanized (which is what I'm looking for).  Location of the restaurant was in a run down (kind of Old Pittsburgh style) and parallel parking was a must$LABEL$1
They have the best Pho (I get the vegetarian version)$LABEL$5
Visiting Pittsburgh for a few days and wanted some Vietnamese so we stopped by here expecting to find the best pho in Pittsburgh. The restaurant setting is very typical of a vietnamese restaurant. The menu is small with very limited choices. Service is minimal. We ordered some spring roll appetizer which was pretty good. Then we had 3 different kind of pho for our main entree. We ordered a \""sate\"" soup$LABEL$2
I've been to Tram's several times$LABEL$1
This is the only pho place... taste is better than Lulu's that's pho sure.$LABEL$4
the pho was good$LABEL$3
Tram has great Pho$LABEL$4
[+] pho soup rice spring rolls amazing flavor waiter with one hand decent price byob [-] avg. ambiance waiter with one hand$LABEL$4
Trams has Vietnamese food and it's in Pittsburgh.  So if you're craving spring rolls with peanut sauce or vermicelli with fish sauce and fresh herbs$LABEL$2
I've been to Tram's Kitchen a few times with friends and I hear good things from people about this place.  Personally$LABEL$2
I pretty much got my dad obsessed with pho when my family came out to California for my graduation in April. Everytime he calls me now he asks if I've had any pho lately. So$LABEL$3
Tram's is a pretty small place$LABEL$3
I feel like this place is right out of a Seinfeld episode.  It's in a tiny space on Penn Ave in Lawrenceville.  Tram is a gentleman who doesn't like it if you're not ready to order immediately when he comes to your table.  Because you only get about 2 minutes to look at the menu$LABEL$3
love the pho and spring rolls !!! the best vietonamese restaurant !! i$LABEL$5
I don't see the hype. Bad service$LABEL$2
Went here last weekend with friends. Two of us became violently ill with food poisoning. Ordinarily$LABEL$1
This is one of the best secrets of Pittsburgh. By far the best Pho in the area and over many places I have visited. If you want good service & environment$LABEL$5
The food here was awesome.  Get some$LABEL$4
I really want to give this place more stars but the food at Pho Van is so much better. Tram's Kitchen tastes like home cooking$LABEL$2
Great hole-in-the-wall Vietnamese joint. They serve all the standard fare$LABEL$4
Great food$LABEL$4
What a great place! Such remarkable$LABEL$4
Embrace the quirkiness of this place and you may just fall in love with it. Food is good$LABEL$4
I'm looking for a Pho I can come home to late at night. A Pho I can dream about on cold days. I have an official Pho place- Pho Bang in NYC- but it's obviously too far away. So far I haven't phound the pho I'm looking for in Pittsburgh. I will persevere and try the other places$LABEL$3
1.5 / 5 - Beef Pho: Kind of bland tasting2.0 / 5 - Pork Chop: Not much meat and as much flavor as I'm used to$LABEL$2
Location:4050 Penn Ave PittsburghPrice: $ 1/2Service: GoodMy family was really hungry and everywhere my parents visit they always want to try native food. So$LABEL$2
If you grew up in a part of the country with lots of Vietnamese food or have eaten it in such places$LABEL$2
The best Vietnamese I have tried in Pittsburgh. The Tufu lemon from the appetizers was just perfect. I found the place from Yelp.com and I would definitely recommend it! Very inexpensive too! I really like it!$LABEL$5
It's about 2.5. We live in Squirrel Hill with a lot of good restaurants and I thought this place is better than where we usually go. The pho is the cheapest in Pittsburgh but the portion is very small. The spring roll is the most expensive vietnamese spring roll. I ordered the Saigon soup for myself and #17 for my husband. My husband likes it because he is an america and like sweet stuff. Everything with coconut is good for him. These dishes we got doesn't look like what they showed on the photo. The Vietnamese place in Squirrel hill or the stripe is a lot better.$LABEL$2
Talk about a hole in the wall. No frills at all here. One page paper menu with only a handful of dishes on it. Worth it for the pho and the price can't be beat.$LABEL$4
First of all$LABEL$1
Just moved to the area and searched for a good place for pho. Stopped by and were pleasantly surprised.  The eggrolls hands down are the best we've ever had. Served them up with plenty of lettuce and herbs just the way we like it. The pho was good but nothing amazing. I had the curry chicken and was pleasantly surprised at how good the flavors were. Curry with just the perfect hint of sweet$LABEL$5
I tried this place$LABEL$3
Had a great meal here! The food was authentic$LABEL$4
I've gone to about five different Vietnamese restaurants in the Pittsburgh area$LABEL$5
The spring rolls are out of this world. The pho is good. We went for lunch and had no problem getting a seat. Cheap and delicious.$LABEL$5
First time here$LABEL$3
This place never disappoints. The Pho is served on very large bowls (that is just the small).  The food has the same quality and taste and for some dishes even better taste than those trendy Vietnamese restaurants in NYC. The fresh veggie spring rolls are def the best way to kick off a meal. This is a small$LABEL$4
I was born and raised eating Pho and this honestly was the blandest I've had. Then$LABEL$2
The locals know:  if you want Vietnamese food$LABEL$3
Given the wide array of chinese$LABEL$3
I had the fresh spring rolls and the pho$LABEL$5
Best Vietnamese in Pittsburgh. The quality of the food in amazing. The service is$LABEL$5
I love this place.  The vermicelli is amazing.  It is a cozy hole in the wall.  The food is so good.  And it's BYOB.$LABEL$4
aw more memories!  many a very early morning / late night meal at ritters... food was always yummy...$LABEL$4
Great place to go if you need grease and carbs to soak up all of the drinking you've been doing!  Many a late night was spent eating grilled cheese with tomato on rye and fries$LABEL$2
I've only been here after 2 AM$LABEL$1
I don't know what it is (certainly not the food) but I love this place!Perhaps it's the individual juke boxes$LABEL$3
Five adults$LABEL$3
Ritters is$LABEL$4
Conveniently across the street from UPMC Shadyside hospital.  Great service and down home atmosphere is hard to beat. Had the liver and onions which came with choice of potatoes$LABEL$3
Rittes is a classic old style diner in the Shadyside neighborhood of Pittsburgh.  It has great diner food and of course great breakfast.It has been a well know sober-up place for years.$LABEL$3
24-hour diner.  The food isn't overwhelmingly good.  It's been around for a long time.  Anytime is a good time to eat there.  Go after 2 and watch the drunks stumble through their meal.  Go in the morning and catch some early birds or old regulars scarfind down a cheap breakfast.  The servers are as pleasant as one can be when working at a 24 hour diner.  It's near UPMC Shadyside$LABEL$4
I used to live around the corner from this place and worked across the street at the hospital. Ritters is a great 24/7$LABEL$4
Finding a good ol' diner in Pittsburgh isn't exactly easy. Pamela's has great breakfast$LABEL$2
Great place to go at 3 am when your hammered and just want some food. Ritters only takes cash and the service can be extremely terrible sometimes. However$LABEL$3
At 2am on a weekend night$LABEL$2
Ritter's is amazing- for what it is: A big$LABEL$3
Worst food in Pittsburgh. That's all. I have been there twice$LABEL$1
I live off of Liberty Ave and everyone kept telling me I needed to try this place$LABEL$1
It's hard not to give this place and extra star just for sentiment. Honestly Ritters is a favorite of mine. I love diner food. If you're looking for a late night$LABEL$3
I will always love this place$LABEL$4
We came here for a casual brunch and were pleasantly surprised. Service was slow as we expected$LABEL$4
Ordered the 2 eggs and potatoes which was only $3.85...DEAL!  I asked for the eggs to be scrambled and it came with home fries and toast.  I know my meal wasn't that exciting and can you really mess up eggs$LABEL$3
I can't really give a food review since I didn't order anything$LABEL$2
Oh$LABEL$3
Fantastic service$LABEL$4
Iconic diner so I've been told and the proof for me today was the fact that the parking lot was packed and there were at least 10 of us standing outside in line waiting IN THE RAIN for our turn at breakfast!  That says something either about the diner or about us (nevermind).The line went fast and we had friendly and efficient service from our server$LABEL$4
Ritter's will never be a fine dining establishment. It will always be a diner. It will always be a standby. It will always be home-cooked$LABEL$4
The food at Ritter's tastes like I made it at home$LABEL$2
I have mixed feelings about Ritters. I love it's location and of course the fact it's open 24/7 but you don't quite get what you pay for$LABEL$3
I'm a huge fan of diners and all their fat-filled-breakfast-food glory. However Ritters has left me doubting my borderline obsession. I got the buckwheat pancakes (apparently their specialty) - while they were fluffy and gargantuan the pancakes themselves were nothing to be desired. This place is convenient$LABEL$3
Late nite meal. Gyro was a bit dry. Coleslaw and fries were great. Rice pudding was great.$LABEL$3
This was some of the worst food I've ever had.  If this is someone's idea of nostalgia$LABEL$1
So after the encouragement of many of my friends I decided to gave this place another try.  We had the fried zucchini$LABEL$4
Your standard$LABEL$4
Food is ok and it is kind of greasy spoon.. The decor is interesting.$LABEL$3
People call it \""Critters\"" for a reason.The two times I've been there I was unhappy.  It's cheap$LABEL$1
Joyce was a great server. She took great care of our party of 7 and was very personable. Cheap$LABEL$2
Ummm$LABEL$1
Pretty standard Greek diner - omelets$LABEL$4
Don't get me wrong$LABEL$1
How does this place even stay in business. It's disgusting. The food is crap. Everything is filthy. All the waitresses look like crackheads. They screwed up a club sandwich & fries. How is that even possible?  It deserves negative stars for sucking so badly.$LABEL$1
Just popped in to Ritters for a late night dinner. It's definitely a step back in time. Shirley$LABEL$4
Ritter's is always good time. Good food and good people watching. Plenty of places to park in the parking lots. Had the grilled ritter's sandwich and it was yummy. My mom had the tuna salad sandwich and said it was good but she's had better.$LABEL$4
We were skeptical to eat here based on the mixed reviews. We can now say we've tried it and we probably won't go back. We were greeted by a hostess who sounded and smelled like she just got done smoking. Instead of escorting us to a seat$LABEL$2
What you expect out of a 24 hour diner.  Food can be pretty good$LABEL$2
I remember my first experience at a diner: Art Deco-inspired architecture$LABEL$2
It is definitely an experience. Located in not such a great part of town. Very old. Food is just ok$LABEL$2
I took my family of 7 here on sunday 11/9. We arrived at 11AM and by 1:20 we had not received our food. This is after ordering over and hour ago. We noticed the table around us received their food even though they had been seated after us. The waitress was very nice and said she was sorry for the wait several times. I finally asked to see the mgr$LABEL$1
Best brunch ever!  You will have better luck getting seated quickly if you arrive by 10am.  They have the best potatoes in the burgh and it's good food that will stick to your ribs!  The service is always quick and friendly.$LABEL$4
Breakfast$LABEL$5
This place is definitely a throwback.  Whether you come in here at 3AM in a drunken stupor or 7PM for a quick meal the food is fantastic.  The breakfast items are all pretty standard but I do enjoy getting it sometimes for dinner.  Some of the other things you must try are the grilled chicken on a pita or the diner burger.  The menu is large and I constantly flip through it even though I know it like the back of my hand.  The service is usually very good and I love the quarter jukeboxes at the tables.$LABEL$4
Ritter's Diner is a breakfast lover's home away from home. The atmosphere is a vintage American greasy spoon--take a black and white photo of the vinyl booths with their own coin-op jukeboxes and convince your friends it's 1960 again. But cozy nostalgic surroundings are just a small piece.Pancakes$LABEL$4
Best drugs in town!$LABEL$5
Meh$LABEL$3
Well$LABEL$2
Family friendly! While some reviewers may lament the outdated interiors$LABEL$4
Don't waste your time!Oh$LABEL$2
I came here awhile back$LABEL$3
There has been a pile of vomit on there sidewalk for 10 days$LABEL$1
People who know me...know me as a food fanatic.  Tessaro's is one of my favorite restaurants in Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
Best Burger In The Universe.I am a burger lover.  People ask me$LABEL$5
Everyone's commentrs about this unpretentious pub style restaurant are understated.  When you approach the corner location your iniotial reaction is that this must be the wrong address.  Keep the faith !!Once inside the people are friendly$LABEL$5
A great Pittsburgh Restaurant.  If you want to get a taste of some great local food here$LABEL$5
Tessaro's has some of the finest burgers in the US.  A wonderful \""corner bar\"" kind of atmosphere makes it THE place to take people in from out of town.  Grilled meats and daily seafood specials (try the prawns) are available and also an excellent choice$LABEL$5
I went here after reading all the great reviews here on yelp. I was not disappointed and I don't believe my companion was either. It was a Friday night around 9 and the place was packed. We got right in and was seated in less than a minute.Our server came right to us for our drink order. We both ended up ordering burgers$LABEL$5
A steakhouse in Bloomfield.  Went there on a Saturday night looking for a good burger.  It was a little crowded.  The burger was large and very tasty.  The buns need a lot of work.  There was no bread or anything beforehand and no appetizers on the menu.   No drink list either$LABEL$3
Tessaro's is definitely the best burger you'll find in Pittsburgh. Their sides are also delicious. If you have vegetarian friends that protest$LABEL$5
This place rules!  Family owned and run$LABEL$4
My friend brought me here right when my plane landed in Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
Putting lamb in your burger is not my idea of 'gourmet' burger. Sure it tastes unique$LABEL$2
I think I was a victim of over-hyped burgers.There was nothing bad about \""the burger$LABEL$3
I was entirely underwhelmed by the supposed \""best burger\"" in Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
The burger was very good can't say anything bad about it. You will not be disappointed$LABEL$3
These burgers are good.The bread they use on said burgers sucks.Dark and not very clean.Bacon blue burger though was worth the trip.  I don't see myself going back very often.$LABEL$3
I also left here scratching my head after all of the lofty reviews of the place.  Yes$LABEL$2
I've had better burgers at several other Pittsburgh restaurants. I have never eaten anything else on the Tessaro menu--and since it doesn't look very appealing$LABEL$2
Tessaros has a full menu$LABEL$5
When a place is famous for something (ie having the best burgers in Pittsburgh) thats what you should order.  Theres a reason it has that distinction.   But in an effort to keep my waistline from increasing$LABEL$3
Tessaro's was both a passing point and my final destination on my hamburger road trip across America.  I've had famous burgers such as the ones at Mr. Bartley's up in MA or the french bread burgers down at Rotier's in Nashville as well as regional burgers like the green chili cheeseburgers of the southwest.After it all$LABEL$5
I can understand why some people give this place 5 stars and some shrug their shoulders and say nothing special.The burgers here are ground fresh by an in house butcher and the meat is good$LABEL$3
Delicious burgers- freshly ground beef and hand-shaped and cooked on a wood-fired grill- amazing. The burgers arrive and look enormous$LABEL$4
Huge burger and good service$LABEL$4
Tessaro's grinds their burger beef fresh$LABEL$5
This place is hyped as the be all end all of burgers.  It may or may not be$LABEL$2
OVERHYPED.  I've had better burgers almost everywhere.$LABEL$2
Usually when I think of a burger$LABEL$5
Never been treated so poorlyI went with three friends to eat at Tessaro's on a rainy Saturday evening.  I dropped them off while I parked the car.  The hostess  sat them and when she found out I was parking the car$LABEL$1
The burger was pretty good but$LABEL$2
Me and Lady Friend of Joe (or lesbian friend) saunter into Tessaro's and I chose her to accompany me since her love of animal protein is well known in the south hills. This girl grills meat outdoors in sub zero weather. I orders the bacon cheese burger with grilled onions and potato salad (no fryer$LABEL$4
In my vegetarian life$LABEL$4
Overrated. No seating until all members if party have arrived...so we awkwardly hovered over empty tables.  The second bummer here was the lack of french fries  - which is borderline criminal when you offer a burger.  The bun was dry$LABEL$2
I'm always trying to hit up places that are listed in the fantastic book \""Hamburger America.\"" Tessaro's is one of two places to be listed for Pennsylvania. I visited while in Pittsburgh a few weeks ago with high expectations. I like the joint$LABEL$2
Let me start out by saying$LABEL$5
I've been coming here for the past 10 years and have always enjoyed the food and  the atmosphere$LABEL$2
After striking out at Pleasure bar for my meatball fix I decided to go burger! From the reviews I have read from my fellow yelpers I have been excited to try \""the best burgers in the burgh\"" Alas my anticipation for stop number 2 was snubbed out because they were closed too. I called and was informed that the hours of operation are Monday-Saturday 11am-11pm. Three other patrons were also going burger and sadly I had to break the news to them too. Oh Dang! Maybe a dog would do the trick? After seeing the Oscar Meyer Weiner Mobile and a quick photo opp Frankie's Extra Long was next on my list.$LABEL$3
Walking into this place it has a homey and welcoming environment. They don't have many tables so I can safely assume it gets pretty crowded later on in the day. I went around 4-5pm so there were only a few other tables taken up.My friend and I both ordered burgers and I was pleasantly surprised with the size of my burger. I hate going to places where they serve you small burgers with an eensy weensy piece of meat in the middle. No$LABEL$3
I would consider myself the burger connoisseur.  I would say the rare burger with mushrooms and raw onions at Tessaro's was definitely one of my best burger experiences.  The meat had a nice flavor and the bun was not \""bready\"".  Two signs of a great burger and  the rest is just fluff.   The only reason I won't give this placet 5 stars is the bartender was not friendly...AT ALL!  Our waitress on the other hand made up for it.$LABEL$4
my burger was really dry and tasteless$LABEL$1
No joke$LABEL$5
So everyone always raves about this place infamous burger joint in bloomfield$LABEL$2
Never understood all the hype about this place. The burgers are rather bland and burnt.  No fries$LABEL$2
Eh$LABEL$2
I have to preface this review with two factors. One$LABEL$2
Stick with things off of the grill.  Also the Pittsburgh style chili is top notch.  I nice place for lunch.$LABEL$3
My boyfriend and I went here for burgers because there are so many good reviews and we heard that they're the best in the 'burgh.  I was disappointed.  I had a bacon cheeseburger and it was okay.  Maybe my expectations are too high$LABEL$2
With how Pittsburghers talk about Tessaro's$LABEL$2
I know$LABEL$2
Gourmet burger with provolone was perfectly cooked and deliciously messy. The home fries are very tasty$LABEL$3
This was my first and last time at this restaurant. I thought Tessaro's was some sort of Pittsburgh landmark and I've heard rave reviews of their burgers. The burger I got was undercooked. I ordered it well done and it was definitely pink in the middle. But I didn't send it back because I never send anything back. I just ate it and it was a sloppy$LABEL$1
I can't figure out the hype surrounding the burgers here.  It's at or near the top of more \""Best Burger in Pittsburgh\"" lists than not$LABEL$2
I just don't understand the appeal.  I've tried this place twice thinking that I somehow had a \""lemon\"" of a burger the first time.  And then returned a few months later.  Nope.  The smoked flavor is okay and the meat seems fresh$LABEL$2
Came here to try their famed burgers.  I ordered the gourmet burger$LABEL$2
Being a native of Pittsburgh I havea always heard tales of the best burger in Pittsburgh. Most of those tales had Tessaro's as the destination in question. The first time and every subsequent time I have been there has held up to it's legend. Don't get me wrong$LABEL$5
Stopped in after the Pitt football game on Saturday pm. Called ahead to let them know our party of 10 was headed their way. They were very accommodating . Had our table ready in no time in the back room. We all had a very nice meal and also able to have a nice group visit.     Now the food.... The Gourmet Burger and hash browns did not disappoint! Juicy$LABEL$4
I have eaten here before and I was very Impressed with the Gourmet Cheeseburger. The Burgers here are \"" special \"" You have to try one to understand \""Special \"" ( that means GREAT for you bone heads out there )This time I had the BEEF Ribs. They were cooked perfectly .The Flame from the wood fired ovens made these ribs so tender and delicious.....  The smell of the wood fire will make a vegetarian beg for a beef fix. The staff was very friendly and very accommodating. have  to give you guys a 5 star here !This place will go back to being one of my favorite Pittsburgh treasures.$LABEL$5
Tessaro's$LABEL$4
This review only encompasses my 2-3 experiences with burgers - THE thing Tessaro's is known for. All I can say is - I don't get the hype. If it weren't for the blue cheese and bacon it would have been borderline inedible. There didn't seem to be any seasoning of the meat whatsoever. Bland would be an understatement. Points for using fresh hand formed beef and consistently preparing it at the requested level of done-ness$LABEL$2
I should preface this by saying this wasn't my pick$LABEL$2
We were between Lot 17 and Tessaro's...I'm not sure if you've ever smelled the wonderful smells that eminate from Tessaro's as your walk past$LABEL$4
Best burger anywhere.  A Pittsburgh landmark.  The best hostess -- charming$LABEL$5
I have heard a good amount of positive reviews of this place from lots of different people. That being said$LABEL$2
A classic! Perfect burger to compliment my visit to Pittsburgh. Can't wait to come back.$LABEL$5
Unlike my boyfriend Darren W$LABEL$4
I want to go back to give it a better review$LABEL$2
You when you hear about a place for years and you finally get the chance to try it out but it's bound to not live up to your expectations? That was my experience of Tessaro's. Had I never heard of it before$LABEL$2
This is the only burger place I have ever been to that doesn't serve french fries. WTF? Went once$LABEL$1
I am only giving this two stars because I believed the hype. The burger I had was good$LABEL$2
After hearing about how great their burgers are by word of mouth from a few different people$LABEL$3
Start out by saying I worked there almost 20 years ago and the place and the employees are the same. In the restaurant business or any business constancy is key. The food is very good and the place is clean. It looks old because it is but that's part of fun. The family who owns it is a great family. If you go through Bloomfield stop in but make sure your hungry.$LABEL$5
Reviewed as one of the best burgers in Pitt and a popular spot among many CMU students$LABEL$3
After getting one of their \""famous\"" burgers$LABEL$2
Sure$LABEL$4
Eh. I was recommended this place buh one of my clients. I figured a 'gourmet' burger meant a good quality burger... Which$LABEL$3
Finally made it to Tessaro's with my husband and another couple.  It truly does have the best burgers ever!  We all got burgers;  2 cheeseburgers and 2 Kelly burgers.  Absolutely delicious!  The guys got chile as well and it was very good...rich and tomatoey and very well seasoned.  The burgers were cooked to order and were great.  Our waitress$LABEL$5
4 of us came here for dinner and ordered burgers and drinks. The pino Grigio tasted bitter and when we complained the waitress acted like we were bothering her by saying anything and kept trying to walk away. She only came to our table 2 times when we were there over two hours. Bad customer service and to be honest we had bad service all around.$LABEL$2
We came for steaks. Mistake. Probably great burgers (if you read the reviews)$LABEL$1
This place is worth checking out of you want a great burger!   It will make you want to come back!$LABEL$5
Horrible Food$LABEL$1
Went for a second time on a busy Friday night and had a 45 minute wait for a table.  The wait was not unexpected$LABEL$2
If you like cheap$LABEL$5
I lived next to Teabags for over a year before checking it out and I definitely regret waiting that long. It is huge on the inside$LABEL$5
Good Italian food at a reasonable price..........some of my family don't like the Pleasure Bar$LABEL$3
Great casual Italian.  The first time I tried (4 years ago)$LABEL$3
i went to this restaurant saturday for the first time. my fiance and i went with a couple who live in bloomfield and go to this restaurant every two weeks or so. We walked in and there were already some people waiting for a table. We stood near the host area for 10 minutes. Several employees including the host walked passed us over a dozen times and never said anything to us. Finally my friend asked how long the wait for a table would be. The host looked at us rudely and said \""I don't know$LABEL$1
It's aight. Not too exciting$LABEL$3
Top of my list for a late lunch today. While  attending the Italian festival in Bloomfield last September I tried the polenta and meatballs$LABEL$3
The appetizers were great. Stuffed mushrooms$LABEL$2
Wow! If I could give negative stars I certainly would for this place. I wanted it to be decent because they have an ok draught selection and seating outside in the summer. That is where the positive qualities end. Food tasted like it came from a microwave - but that is actually generous$LABEL$1
Growing up in pittsburgh I heard a lot of good things about this place but it must have gone down hill over the years. First off the area we were sat in was anything but a place you would go for a nice dinner$LABEL$1
Well to be honest this was one of the worst dinning experiences of my eating career. We sat outside and the service was VERY SLOW. Then my purse gets stolen right from my hand by what I can only describe as a gang of thugs. As if that wasn't bad enough the slow wait staff took about ten minutes to call the police and then proceeded to charge us for our mediocre meals even as they saw me telling the police how my wallet had been stolen under the waitstaffs not so watchful eye. Save your money and your wallet and go to wendy's the quality is far superior to this place.$LABEL$1
I have really good food here in the past (try eggplant rolatini) and the local bread is fantastic. Tonight$LABEL$2
This is a pretty cool place in the heart of Bloomfield. I've never eaten at the restaurant$LABEL$3
not my fav! weird mixture of sit-downy restaurant and bar$LABEL$2
Ah$LABEL$3
Despicable service at the bar$LABEL$1
Some friends and I were here Friday$LABEL$1
This place does not have good italian sauce it tasted like chef boyardee and my crab cakes were not cooked in the middle it was cold. I wont be back.$LABEL$1
Food is great but the service at the bar is horrendous. Last few times we have went the bartender was unable to cope with even a half full bar. Went back in August on a Friday and asked if we could sit outside at one of the tables in front$LABEL$2
I have been coming here for years. The doctor was always great and the receptionist was super helpful and sweet. They recently got a new receptionist$LABEL$1
We checked in very late but the concierge was very helpful.  The lobby is big and inviting and there's free coffee and wi-fi.  The rooms were clean and big$LABEL$4
I didn't bring a black light or anything$LABEL$4
Walking into your hotel room can either be one of the simpler joys in life$LABEL$4
So we've been a couple times. It's a cute little place$LABEL$3
Oh Twisters is fun. We had ice cream here not long ago. I had some Blizzard-type thing$LABEL$4
The beauty of living directly next to Twisters is that well I have an unlimited supply of frozen goodies right in my backyard literally.I only get the chocolate vanilla swirl for myself and a small scoop of sugar free vanilla ice cream for the puppy.The ladies that work there during the summer are always super nice.Nothing to ever complain about here.$LABEL$5
Twisters really wasn't that great. I had a snickers flurry. The vanilla soft serve just didn't have the right texture and the snickers tasted stale. The medium size$LABEL$3
In general$LABEL$5
We had heard good things about this little neighborhood bar$LABEL$2
Silky's (in Bloomfield) has the best BLT in Pittsburgh! I don't know the exact specs$LABEL$3
I like this bar.  I will keep going.  But the food is so average to below average its painful to eat there.  Overpriced pasta dishes that taste laughably cheap.  the typical fried everything apps.I had a burger and fries off the special menu and I have to say it was ok.  My mind was not blown in any way shape or form$LABEL$3
We stopped at Silky's in search of a late lunch. The decor is very old school bar style$LABEL$4
I started out really disliking the food at Silky's...especially where there are better 'bar food' options within a mile.  But$LABEL$3
Stopped in tonight for a late mini-celebration dinner. I had a really really big$LABEL$4
I am going with the \""A-Ok\"" rating here$LABEL$3
Captain's Log Stardate: Circa 2004 - 2006-ish... I lived about an hour and a half outside of the city. Coming here was usually pretty exciting. (Here as in the city$LABEL$1
Awesome wings and they're 50 cents during all Pen's games$LABEL$5
My 2nd city.  And one of my favourite sports bars.TVs everywhere$LABEL$4
They have an amazing on tap beer selection. Several small tvs. But if the Steelers aren't playing$LABEL$3
This is one of the coolest laid back bars to go to. It draws a little bit of an older crowd$LABEL$5
I really like Silky's- it's a great little bar with a good two list. Last time I was there the southern tier 2xipa was on. So. Good. I had the Reuben and was so happy with it. Crispy buttery bread with corned beef and sauerkraut. The fries on the side were crispy and soft in the middle.I'll be back!$LABEL$4
Excellent food! Excellent service! I would highly recommend this place to anyone who wants a great meal with great service.$LABEL$5
good place for a quick Guinness$LABEL$3
I'm not one for ordering out at work with coworkers very often and this experience can probably tell you why.Boston Market has this nifty gadget on their website that allows you to order via the Internet$LABEL$2
Years ago I definitely would have given this Boston Market a five stars.  I now give this Boston Market four stars because of the corporate policy.  Boston Market serves their meals on real glass plates and real silverware.  Once customers are finished with their meals they leave everything on the tables.  During busy times when the dining room often looks messy as tables are often cluttered with napkins and dished which often have uneaten food on it.  I like the old method alot better.  Plastic plates and customers throw their own trash away.$LABEL$4
Located on Baum blvd;  Coming fromNegley or Liberty ave it will be on your right hand side Across from UPMC cancer center and before Get Go.If comming from the opposite direction; be aware there's no stop light. Depending on the time of day making a left hand turn can be a challenging.For my car the average oil change runs about $40.On most visits it takes em about 20 minutes.  It took a little longer because something with my oil pan plug thingy. Whatever the issue They came up to me$LABEL$1
They are friendly professional reliable quick I think that's enough . I keep coming back to them because I trust them.$LABEL$5
$400 IN DAMAGESThey cracked my oil pan and it cost me four hundred dollars to repair. Everything was fine before I brought it here. Mechanic said it looked like they put my bolt in crooked and then hammered it in. Avoid at all cost. They will ruin your car.$LABEL$1
Never go to this Jiffy Lube.  They tried to charge me $45 for an oil change- no way! I just asked them to change my headlight bulb$LABEL$1
Terrible experience. I dropped my car off at 9:25 AM on a Saturday and there was one other person in front of me. I didn't leave until 11:05AM and was charged $99 for a synthetic oil changed. Overpriced$LABEL$1
I went to jiffy lube for a routine oil change. I waited for an hour and a half$LABEL$1
Very bad service. They are extremely slow. I waited 90 minutes even though there were just 2 cars in front of me. I bought the signature service which includes vacuuming which they didn't do at all. When I told them that$LABEL$1
I'm surprised Lot 17 hasn't been reviewed more on Yelp. It really is a quality restaurant and bar. They have a solid menu with good food$LABEL$4
Three stars may be to high or two low$LABEL$3
Go there only if you want served uncooked fish$LABEL$1
I went to Lot 17 Bar and Grill after working late one evening to meet up with some friends. The look of the place is pretty decent with your standard bar seating but with the nice addition of an outdoor seating area which is great to people watch on the bussling streets of Bloomefield.I arrived last of my party and was starving$LABEL$2
I feel like Lot 17 doesn't advertise their tasty selection of food enough! You walk thinking you're going to find typical bar food but that is not that case at all. Everything is very fresh tasting and you can tell a lot of it is homemade! The reason they are only getting 3 stars is each time I've been there the service was so-so. Somewhat understaffed for lunchtime. :( Also a word to the wise$LABEL$3
DON'T GET THE FISH!Just had a fish sandwich at Lot 17 and it was 85% breading and 15% fish.  It looks impressive as hell coming out in two big pieces hanging over the bun.  Of course it was only 7.50 which isn't bad but I wouldn't recommend anyone to get it.  There are other items on the menu that are Lent friendly. I have had other food at Lot which has been good so I felt the need to rate it 3 stars.  I will go back eventually but it won't be for a fish sandwich.$LABEL$3
Way better than your average \""bar\"" food. But make no mistake$LABEL$4
I visited Lot 17 on an uncommonly warm late Friday in October for lunch with a buddy from work. We were walking down Liberty and went into Lot 17 on a lark. I wish that lark would have kept me going down Liberty Ave. to find somewhere else with tastier grub.When we walked into the restaurant$LABEL$2
My Merlot was decent but the calamari was not. The calamari while had hints of Italian seasoning was bland and became soggy of the cooked vegetables that they had underneath it. Plus I think I found a fry or two with the vegetables. Also Lot 17 had some funky smells throughout the time that we were there. Service could have been better. I might return for drinks but only drinks.$LABEL$2
I've been here twice and ordered to-go once.  The food is bad!  Last night our table ordered French fries$LABEL$2
Stopped by Lot 17 for some apps and drinks with a few girlfriends.  I was in the mood for some fries and got the regular ones which were piping hot and fresh when they came out.  I ordered a glass of cabernet but I probably should have opted for beer. Decent place for drinks and apps - it was crowded so they must be doing something right.  I would check this place out again and try a full meal.$LABEL$3
I always enjoy my time at Lot 17. You can just hang out and grab a beer or enjoy some food in the back. The food is amazing. I especially enjoy the Mediterranean Seafood Salad. It is a MUST ORDER. The sweet potato fries are a great compliment to any of the burgers$LABEL$5
With all the places in Bloomfield you can probably do better.A couple of my friends and I wanted drinks and food around 9 on a Friday and Bloomfield is one of our favorite neighborhoods.  We figured we'd park and just see where we ended up.  After trying a couple of favorites and finding them too jammed packed we settled for Lot 17.  Service wasn't anything special and lacked any emotion.  Like any.  I've been here before and remembered this to be true in the past as well.  As for the food$LABEL$3
Been going here for YEARS and just love it. Love it! Time to update! It's always an option on a Saturday afternoon when we're thinking of someplace to go to have an early dinner$LABEL$4
My husband and I visited on a quiet Friday afternoon$LABEL$1
Every neighborhood needs a go-to joint$LABEL$4
Consistently great food at a fair price.  I suggest the French Dip - a new addition to the already great menu.$LABEL$5
I came here for the first time Saturday to watch the atrocious pitt vs. UVA football game. We got there early enough to secure Seats at the bar. It got packed quickly once the game started as lot 17 is a true \""pitt\"" bar. Service at the bar was very prompt and friendly despite them being very busy. We started off with an order of garlic jerk wings which were very tasty. Not overly spicy or garlicky and cooked perfectly crisp. I later ordered the Rachael with sweet potato fries. My boyfriend ordered the Reuben with Cajun fries.they have several other menu items that looked good: a salmon blt$LABEL$4
the waitresses are salty.the food is mediocre (at best).the place is a total dump.however$LABEL$2
The only positive thing I can say is about this place it is open late.We ate breakfast food at 2:30 am after the bars closed.Pancakes were burnt. Hash browns were burnt. A breakfast sandwich had weird burnt meat on it. I was drunk I don't remember.Bah. Cook/waiter was funny$LABEL$2
Friendly$LABEL$5
I love this place!It's not fancy$LABEL$4
Ate here this morning with my dad for breakfast. I've lived here over 3 years and have never been here but was glad I came. I ordered a veggie omelette which came with hash browns or home fries and toast and my dad got the spinach and red pepper skillet which had the hash browns already in it and toast on the side. The food and coffee were both awesome$LABEL$3
A great option when there are no other options.  If you find yourself devastatingly hungry in Bloomfield at 3am to drunk to drive or walk ANYPLACE else$LABEL$2
If you are looking for a place that has high class  decor.... this place is definitely NOT for you at all.  If you want a REAL down to earth place without any fakeness... this is definitely the place for you.  This is a very tiny place that hold 18 people inside (plus two table on the outside)I love this place.   The food is great!!!!!The food is to die for.  Mama R. will make anything you want even though it may not be on the  menu.  The portions are very generous.  The place is owned by two awesome people (Mike and Ros).  They are definitely from the 60s era.  Don't let the employees scare you away.  They are ALL super nice people.They have body piercings and tatoos every where.  Immediately after walkingin I felt so comfortable. Thanks Ross for an awesome breakfast.PS.. This place only take cash.$LABEL$5
Nice$LABEL$4
Its a tiny$LABEL$4
This place has the worst french fries I have ever tasted. They were literally BLACK. All I tasted was burnt oil. My photo is the zucchini planks and that lump of blackness are the French fries that I was sent home with. I could not even eat one! I also ordered the zucchini planks and a grilled cheese on rye with bacon. The grilled cheese was incredibly dry and the cook put the bread together upside down$LABEL$1
This has become another Bloomfield Institution.  It's a great place to get breakfast and they do serve lunch.  The hours are odd$LABEL$5
Disappointing.  The food was below average and the service was ok.  We were expecting a lot from this restaurant but it definitely did not deliver.  Pasta was not homemade and sauces mediocre at best.  Wine selection is very weak.  The outdoor seating is a redeeming quality.$LABEL$2
Solid American Italian food that's not making a pretense of being anything else.  The service was incredibly friendly$LABEL$3
I really wanted Alexanders to be great - like a hidden gem in a sea of Big Burritos and high-priced Shadyside Italian joints. Well$LABEL$3
Very average Italian food.  If you're looking for a pasta+sauce experience$LABEL$2
I'm not really a big fan of going out and eating Italian since many of the pasta dishes prepared at restaurants seem like they came from the frozen section of the local grocery store$LABEL$4
Living in Bloomfield$LABEL$4
I went there recently with my family$LABEL$3
The food - bruschetta and fried ravioli apps$LABEL$4
Seat yourself in the back.... Only one server/bartender from 2-4:30 pm.... But good service regardless....fried ravioli was good.... Meatballs ok... Chicken rissoto was delicious....chicken eggplant parm was fried....( just to give a heads up)....lemon bar is very sweet( but good).  Carrot cake yummy....1 dessert is enough to feed 2!  Discounts for upmc family house guests..... It started raining and the manager offered to drive us back to family house when we asked to call a taxi... Great service for a good price.... Definately would recommend!$LABEL$4
I'm sorry$LABEL$1
Portions$LABEL$4
The food here is authentic and FILLING! Each table has a nice setup complete with oil & vinegar to start out with when the fresh$LABEL$4
Not real Italian. When there's a crab dish on the menu and you don't let your customers know this there's a problem. Imitation crab meat at an Italian restaurant doesn't fly. I was hoping for some good Italian while out of town and was truly disappointed. The bar service was extremely friendly about my compliant and did remove that dish from my bill. My entree was pasta and shrimp. I haven't paid $20 for a dish of pasta and 5 large shrimp in a long time. Don't worry but I won't come close to this restaurant again.$LABEL$1
Had veal romano$LABEL$5
I wasn't really a fan. In fact$LABEL$2
So a friend and I went to Alexander's because it was the closest restaurant to his place and we didn't feel like driving on the snow-covered roads.  I didn't have high expectations - I thought I would get standard Italian fare with nothing special while also probably paying too much.  From the get go I was wrong!The decor and ambiance isn't upscale but it also isn't terrible.  It feels like a down home$LABEL$4
Just went to Alexanders Italian Bistro$LABEL$5
Stopped in for dinner on a Sunday night at 7pm and Alexander's was about half full. We decided to go simple and stick with the Pastabilities. I choose the Bolognese with penne  (~$12) and mushrooms (extra $1.50)$LABEL$4
Looking at all the other reviews about this place$LABEL$2
I've eaten at Alexander's for a decade$LABEL$1
A friend took me here for the best gnocchi I have ever eaten. We both chose the gorgonzola basil sauce; I added sweet baby peas and she added broccoli. We ate and ate and took home enough for dinner - it reheats really well. Clearly$LABEL$5
solid 4-star restaurant.  my wife took my sister/bro-in-law here as part of a night on the town.+1 for street parking on the side of the building.+1 for being very attentive to us$LABEL$4
I have been coming to Alexander's  off and on for almost 25 years. I think in all that time I have only had one meal that was below par. Pretty good average I'd say. I went the other night with my adult daughter. I had the calamari with pasta$LABEL$4
I AM BOYCOTTING ALEXANDER'S FOR LIFE!!! The manager SCREAMED AT ME at the top of his lungs in an epic meltdown that lasted 10 minutes! On Sat.$LABEL$1
Suffice it to say$LABEL$2
Very nice classic Pittsburgh neighborhood Italian.  Best choice for hearty$LABEL$4
We ended up at Sammy's Famous Corned Beef after trying to get pho at Tram's Kitchen and forgetting it was a Monday (Tram's is closed on Mondays).  The bright neon lights flashing FAMOUS across the street beckoned for us to head over and try it out... so we did.I ordered the Sammy's Special$LABEL$3
Crappy$LABEL$1
I had driven by Sammy's countless times when heading into Lawrenceville$LABEL$3
If you're famous$LABEL$2
I always thought I hated Thai food$LABEL$5
well i finally took the advice of fellow yelpers and gave Thai Cuisine a shot last weekend.   I showed up at 930 on Friday night and the place was packed.  I had to wait 15 minutes for a table.  I always feel waiting for a table is more of a positive than a negative as it usually means good things are to come.  I started out with the special shrimp fried in wontons.  It was unmemorable and I would of like to have seen bigger shrimp for this 6.95 appetizer.  I ordered the vegetable tom yum soup.  This was outstanding.  The vegetables were large and fresh and the spice was perfect.  I asked for medium and actually got medium.  I went with the standard pineapple curry as i always do the first time at a thai place.  Every bite was enjoyable and again the medium spice was perfect.  Like so often at thai restaurants i am always sad when i get to the bottom of the bowl.    Looking forward to my next visit. (4.5 stars)$LABEL$4
Pretty good Thai$LABEL$4
I love Thai Cuisine!! It is probably my favorite place to eat. I usually get their pineapple curry and it is fabulous. The service is usually great and they are always quick to refill your water glass. It is not cheap$LABEL$5
I surmised two things from my visit to Thai Cuisine:a) the competition among thai restaurants must not be very stiff in this townb) yinzers wouldn't know good thai food if it flew into their open mouthsThis place was horrible. My fried trout was just a battered butterflied fish not much different from what you'd find at a church fish-fry. Insipid$LABEL$1
All I'm sayin' is that I crave Thai Cuisine's Tom Kha Veggie soup. Perfect winter warm up$LABEL$3
Thai Cuisine is a good Thai restaurant$LABEL$3
I heart Thai Cuisine! Ryan B. and I always go there for our Thai fix! We ordered the Tom Yum shrimp soup$LABEL$5
After moving from SF to Denver about 1.5 years ago$LABEL$4
never had a bad experience until i ordered take out lately$LABEL$4
Hands down a great thai restaurant.   I ordered the Tom Yum Veggie Soup because of all the yelper's great experience$LABEL$5
I know I've always like this place but I seem to forget how good it actually is until I have it again. This is really solid Thai. The curries are delicious and loaded with fresh ingredients (I've had the red$LABEL$4
Not much to say but I like this place. The Thai style fried rice with crab or lobster meat is pretty good. Service is ok and ambiance is good.$LABEL$3
I think Pittsburgh is a little weird. Restaurants and places close at odd times and therefore my friend and I were stranded on Liberty Ave looking for a decent restaurant that was open. We gave up and decided to go for some Thai. It's a very nice place and I was very happy with the fact that our waiter was friendly. I always like polite and friendly servers. I ordered the hot and sour soup which I gobbled up right away. It was delicious and super hot$LABEL$4
(BYOB)Went here for Saturday lunch with my husband$LABEL$5
After being deprived of Thai food for 2 years$LABEL$3
Really enjoyed the food here!  I was contemplating whether to give it 4 stars but then I thought what could have been better and couldn't really think of anything.  The service was prompt and friendly - they were attentive without being annoying.  I got what I usually get at Thai places - Spicy Basil Noodles and they were probably the best I've had in Pittsburgh.  I got a level 8 spicy and most of the time at other Thai establishments I'm disappointed in the lack of spiciness even when I get a level 8$LABEL$5
fyi--no delivery!  still good for our purposes--carry out friday night.  RED CURRY soaked in sugar (but that's what makes it authentic!)PAD THAI passable but skimped on the green onions (definitely more authentic compared to whatever it is they call pad thai at Lulu's Noodles)YUM YAI salad nothing special but the SAUCE hit the spotTOM KHA GHA too heavy on the oil compared to better versions in my memoryfor the price and proximity$LABEL$3
I've been here twice so far and it is actually very good. I'm extremely judgmental when it comes to thai food and though the food wasn't perfect (but it was satisfying) i'm still going to give it four stars because I have yet to find a better thai place in Pittsburgh that isn't a murderously long drive away from our house.$LABEL$4
Why haven't I revewied Thai Cuisine before?! I was feeling ridiculously lazy tonight so I ordered delivery from them for the millionth time (available through Wheel Deliver$LABEL$4
This place is aces for dinner. I've never been at lunchtime but have always been impressed with their dinner service. They're always busy but manage to have a swift table turnover. The BYOB/W makes it even better. It's nice to be able to bring my own and splurge on dessert.I have the massaman curry pretty frequently. I also love the tom kha chicken soup.$LABEL$4
I agree 100% on Maggie G's review. Over priced$LABEL$1
Bummer. Closed until the end of January 2012 for renovations.$LABEL$4
Great Thai food - ambiance is great$LABEL$5
Our favorite place in Pittsburgh for Thai food! Service is excellent!!! We're kind of regulars now and we always get lucky to be served by this white guy who is awesome and polite. Their food is a little expensive but its so good. Try their tum yum veggie soup!!!! My favorite!$LABEL$5
I didn't quite realize how much I love Thai Cuisine until they closed for a few months to remodel. Their absence was deeply felt. Now that they are back in action$LABEL$5
I was SO in the mood for Mexican I could taste the salt water of the Gulf all the way from Pittsburgh. Unfortunately$LABEL$4
Came here for lunch on a weekday with the bf and during our meal$LABEL$3
I've had better Thai food$LABEL$3
blandest thai food in pittsburgh I think.  You could really just walk down a few blocks and spend less for better food.  I think the only people that like the food are vegatarians since they have fake meats.  Their sauces literally are all the same$LABEL$2
Good food every time.We get a lot of take-out from here and occasionally dine-in.  All noodle dishes are great.Tofu saute appetizer is a favorite of ours.Soup is yummy too!$LABEL$4
Food was not bad (I ordered the green curry chicken)$LABEL$3
Pretty good and decently priced for a Thai place. I was sick when I went there (the ginger tea helped me quite a bit). The wait staff was very friendly and came over to ask if we needed anything on a regular basis even though it was close to 10pm.Spicy noodles were great. We also ordered the lychee curry$LABEL$4
They only deliver through WheelDeliver.com$LABEL$1
Still sticking with my original rating.  Just had dinner here last night.  The decor is great with the new remodel and all$LABEL$3
Let me start this by saying I got on the wrong bus and ended up walking from Garfield to Bloomfield and then once in Bloomfield I proceeded to get lost behind West Penn Hospital. With that being said I was hoping that all my stumbling around in the elements would not be in vain.   The food at Thai Cuisine is more pitiful than my sense of direction. I ordered Threes Company: shrimp$LABEL$2
Great location!$LABEL$4
One of my favorite Thai places in the city.There isn't one complaint I have about this little place.  The hostess greeted us and gave us a choice of tables.  The waiter introduced himself and gave his recommendations on the menu.  We ordered an appetizer$LABEL$5
Awesome!  We ate here several times and everything was very good.  Good service$LABEL$5
It is okay for the food$LABEL$3
A year later$LABEL$2
Top Tier Thai.  Best Green Curry in the city.We've been there twice$LABEL$4
Pittsburgh has very few good Thai resturants. I ordered here for delivery. It was the best delivery I found in my area for good Pad Se Ew. They only have delivery through Wheel Deliver$LABEL$3
Great service and fantastic food. We were short on time coming in and I was fresh off a rough day of work and en route to a breastfeeding class with my wife.    After a failed first entry in an Italian joint that wasn't going to cut it in 45 minutes or allow me to be awake after$LABEL$4
First of all$LABEL$3
With the not-so-recent closing of Sweet Basil still looming in my mind$LABEL$3
very delicious and good service. byob$LABEL$5
A haiku:Yum Yum Yum Yum YumGood Oh My God So Good YesYum Yum Yum Yum YumHere is a story about the time I had a MAJOR FAIL:I lived in Bloomfield just blocks from this place$LABEL$5
The Tom Kha is delicious. All of the curry's hit the spot as well$LABEL$4
Okay Thai food$LABEL$2
Great little bar/restaurant! They always have the games on$LABEL$4
Great food$LABEL$4
Don't waste your money!!! When I moved to Brookline about 8 years ago$LABEL$1
Hi$LABEL$1
Note the date on this review because$LABEL$1
Very strange place. Idk what was going on but I went in around 12 pm and there are tons of young kids (5-8) running around the bar. Not a big deal just thought it odd. Got a huge plate of nachos were alright. The rest of us got assorted hoagies. Just meh sorta flavorless. And side dishes tasted as if they were made a long time ago. Good place 4 a large group to drink get apps tho.$LABEL$2
I haven't been to the Getaway in a few years$LABEL$2
If I had written this review before today$LABEL$3
This is one of those places that you really really WANT to like$LABEL$2
My boyfriend and I stopped into the Getaway last night to catch the last two periods of the Pens vs. Kings game. We arrived around 7:30 and it wasn't crowded so we took a couple of seats at the bar. Rose$LABEL$4
Went to Getaway last night for famous fajitas. Not so famous anymore... Waitress brought steaming hot plate after very long wait$LABEL$1
I feef that the waitress was not trained correctly and she should never have been fired$LABEL$2
Fiori's has the Best Pizza on Earth$LABEL$5
A south hills legend.  The only problems are a total lack of parking and long wait but a great pizza if you can be patient.$LABEL$4
I LOVE Fiori's. The thought of their slices makes me drool. I can't think of a more perfect pizza anywhere. The pizza sauce is so deliciously sweet$LABEL$5
First I must clarify that my rating here is based on my scale of pizza-ratings only. This pizza is certainly edible$LABEL$2
My fave pizza near the burgh.  The sauce is so unique... it's sweet and delicious.  I like the wings here too.  I don't know why.  I just like the combo of hot wing sauce with sweet pizza sauce.  Located in a weird spot up a hill$LABEL$3
I have to admit$LABEL$2
It was late and on the way home with nothing at home to eat.  Stopped by Fiori's$LABEL$2
My stepfather-in-law gave me sage advice about finding good pizza. If you don't know the pizza in an area$LABEL$5
We stopped at Fiori's after a late night walking around the inclines in Pittsburgh--although it is no where near the inclines.  We decided to grab a large pizza to fix our hunger and were not disappointed.Fiori's feels like a place out of a Ben Afflack movie--the neighborhood joint where everyone knows each other.  In our half an hour there$LABEL$5
A friend of mine calls this the best pizza in Pittsburgh.  I disagree$LABEL$4
Just the facts:1) Realize there is a difference between authentic Italian pizza which varies from region to region and American/Italian Pizza.2) Fiori's falls under the latter category.  This is not authnetic Italian pizza.  In my opinion$LABEL$5
I really don't understand the hype of this place. To be honest$LABEL$2
Fiori's is always at$LABEL$4
Stifled my pizza fix but I found the sauce a little too sweet.  The place was packed so they are clearly doing something right.  Employees behind the counter were very friend$LABEL$3
Just tried this place for the first time the other day. Personally$LABEL$5
Good pizza . Not the best but good.  It would do them a lot of good if they took debit cards/credit as payment rather than the very antiquated cash only .  I'd think they'd double their business$LABEL$3
Maybe the best pizza in Pittsburgh. If you want to see how pizza is supposed to taste give them a try. If you live near them and you haven't tried their pizza you probable live under a rock and don't deserve this delicious pizza.$LABEL$5
We ordered two pizzas and wings on a Friday night over the phone for pick up. They told us it would be ready in an hour. Sure$LABEL$1
I have tasted the best pizza in the US$LABEL$2
Okay I'm not from this area and we came from the casino and were looking for a good place to eat and came across fiores so I'm thinking people from Pittsburg have a distinctive taste when it comes to their pizza I wasn't sure how to rate this place... The service was okay... To be honest the workers looked pretty miserable but they weren't rude or anything. We tried the cheese sticks$LABEL$3
This has got to be one of my favorite places for Pizza in all of Pittsburgh!  When a pizza place does not have to deliver or even have a convenient place to park to pick up your carry out order$LABEL$5
Eat at Fioris$LABEL$2
I'm with Zachary on this one$LABEL$2
As far as pizza goes this is pretty$LABEL$3
There are some great pizza places in this City$LABEL$4
Excellent Pizza. We got the large with pepperoni$LABEL$5
I appreciated the quality of the ingredients and the atmosphere very much$LABEL$3
Good little pizza place. The sauce is somewhat sweet like others have said$LABEL$4
Ok I'm from the southhills and realize people in Pgh have no idea what good pizza is. I assure you this place isn't it. Problem is the block heads that love this place so much just say they love it cause they are from brookline and think it's cool to say \""I love fioris\"" with a really slang sound . Hoagies are garbage and sorry but provolone cheese isn't used on a true ital pizza and sweet sauce ? Garbage !!!! After all the garbage food you get unbelievable attitude. Lol this place would not last 2 weeks in New York plain and simple!!!$LABEL$1
Purchased a '12 Prius. Have been in for 2 scheduled maintenance services and am very satisfied.$LABEL$5
$61.95 state inspection for checking in here. I was invited last night to a new owner's dinner and orientation of my new car. The food was good and the presentation was fair. They had door prizes and afterwards you could talk about any issues.I met with the service team regarding my upcoming apt and got my concerns resolved.I still have trouble understanding my new vehicle. I waited until nearly everyone was gone to get a \""fast\"" overview. I had to end up reading the owner's manual just to figure out how to turn things off.On the overhaul picture however$LABEL$3
I stopped at Rohrich Toyota to look at their selection of used vehicles. I was quickly greeted by Paul - who was great! I test drove a Honda Element$LABEL$2
Basically when we took our car in to see if they would look at the issues with our car they responded like a bunch of mindless monkeys with wrenches. Toyota will not take the time to find the solution to what is wrong with your car. Do not buy from Day or Rohrich$LABEL$1
We've been to a lot of car dealerships in the last few weeks$LABEL$1
Ahhhhh. I cut my teeth on the RW&B in the mid nineties and just revisited it for the first time since then!! I always looked for thrift stores like this in LA and SF but....hell no. Wow$LABEL$5
After going to nearly every thrift store in the burgh$LABEL$4
Love the store. Nice stuff. Price reasonable. BAD parking...Employees at this location are nicer and willing to help compare to the one at Ohio River Blvd....Easy check out. Friendly staff.....$LABEL$2
As a general store that sells things for generally cheaper this is ok. Just ok. The perks are that is has its own parking lot$LABEL$2
I'll be the first to admit that I'm a little weary of shopping at thrift stores. The clothes always smell like they have been in the attic or someone's basement. The store washes the clothing but you can sometimes smell the faint scent of cigarettes. Not all the clothes are bad though.I like to shop for the high end shirts and pants. They tend to have a lot of items and the prices are out of this world. They have a lot of clothes are are still new with the tags on them and every thing. I recently purchased 6 shirts$LABEL$4
It's a like a stampede when you enter this store! The least of the problem is the other shoppers$LABEL$2
Parking sucks. It smelled. They are way way overpriced!  I saw a bag priced at $15 that was apparently donated from a yard sale because it had another tag for $3!  Just really lots of junk. Also it's a cash only place but they do have an atm. Their clothes are sorted by color which is cool.$LABEL$1
I've been to many thrift stores in my life and this one is definitely over priced! They are selling some items at a price that I could spend on the same item brand new! The store closes at 6:00 which is very inconvenient for most people who work a 9-5. I had to rush to get there after work and still didn't get there until 5:45.It is a cash only establishment and the staff was very rude.I'd rather spend my money at Goodwill!$LABEL$1
Mike$LABEL$5
I am a big fan of It's Greek to Me in Brookline.  This tiny little place at the edge of Brookline doesn't look like much$LABEL$4
It's not Greek to me$LABEL$5
I wanted to explore Brookline and decided to stop here based on the reviews.I have to admit that I was expecting a lot more. But sometimes they say$LABEL$3
A revisit for dinner$LABEL$3
While driving around$LABEL$3
Kribel's is a Pittsburgh / Brookline institution. They have good treats$LABEL$3
First visit here last Friday.  Figured we would try a few items.  Got a longjohn donut$LABEL$4
Very sad to find that donuts are made the day before.  I ordered three dozen donuts at about $10 a dozen$LABEL$1
I have been in Brookline for a year and consider this to be one of the jewels of the neighborhood.I visited in May 2014 for dinner with a friend.  He had veal parm.  It came stand alone and the pasta on the side at cost.  I had the old tried and true spaghetti and meatballs.The veal was excellent.  Breaded ever so lightly$LABEL$4
We live down the street and have been meaning to come here... Now that we have$LABEL$5
This is my first visit here I was not extremely impressed when I first walked through the door.  We went to the back by the pool tables and wow it opens up nicely.  Our server was nice and prompt I asked her about a menu item and she said she didn't know but wait and I'll ask... Love that... we could hear the chef yelling the answer she came out and told us even though we had already heard the answer.  I ordered the Reuben my wife ordered the beacon cheese burger. The bread was light and perfectly tested.  the sourcrout was very nice and I suspect actual Russian dressing$LABEL$5
Pita Land has the best pitas in the city$LABEL$5
Score ethnic food! I will say that I love their hummus. It's very tasty as well as their pitas (which appear to be sold all over the city). The staff is friendly and helpful and they have many things that you can't find anywhere else.$LABEL$5
Pitaland is the best run business in Brookline (with las palmas a close second).  The caf\u00e9 is well staffed and the food is delicious.  I love the breakfast flatbreads and falafel for lunch.  In a slew of mismanaged bars with little to no fresh food offerings on the Boulevard$LABEL$5
Pita Land$LABEL$5
I stopped by here this past Tuesday with my father for lunch.  I had been wanting to try Pitaland since I first saw it on the boulevard and was excited to finally make it there.  Whenever we finally made it inside$LABEL$3
This place is amazing and anyone who isn't giving it 5 stars is crazy. My husband and I just moved to Brookline from NYC and when we discovered this place I felt like I struck gold. The pita is incredible...like the freshest most delicious pita I have ever had. The baba ghanoush is fantastic and smokey...omg. I could eat that every day. I had the spinach pie with feta cheese and it was yummy. My husband liked his gyro$LABEL$5
I was looking in Pittsburgh for a cuban rum cake... so after looking in different bakeries... I called the party cake shop and they have an italian rum cake... so I asked them that if they could make some changes$LABEL$5
Had a delicious lemon curd paczki and another raspberry jelly paczki (great taste but the sugar content of the filling was a little overwhelming). I recommend the lemon curd. Friendly counter staff.$LABEL$3
If this place is affiliated with the bakery of the same name on Beverly Rd. in Mt. Lebanon$LABEL$1
I can't speak to the actual store or service because I've never been there$LABEL$4
Our fav pizza spot in Pittsburgh! 1/2 butcher block & 1/2 veggie lovers is Awesome!You get what you expect- Delicious PIZZA!  Toss salad is good with the pizza and the Calzones are great too!! MMMMM I'm getting hungry remembering it.   Look at the specialty pizzas on the back of the menu cause that's where it's at!!! Honestly$LABEL$5
owner is a terrible terrible person. tossed me out for no good reason. i found the food very average overall$LABEL$1
\""Filthy\"" isn't a strong enough term. Try \""infested.\""  NEVER$LABEL$1
Can this place get an order correct the 1st time? I think not!$LABEL$2
Pretty interior$LABEL$2
I don't even know what to say other than$LABEL$5
Seeing the signs for quite some time$LABEL$5
Worst McDonalds!!! they took 45 min for one burger BULLSHIT!!! someone needs fired!$LABEL$1
I've never had bad drive-thru service here and their food is sometimes all you need. Like when I'm hungry$LABEL$3
Seriously the worst McDonalds I've ever been to. Service is always slow. I'm currently sitting in the parking lot right now with about 4 other cars from the drive thru that are waiting for food. If I could read my receipt (printer must be low on ink)$LABEL$1
This isn't the worst McDonalds in town$LABEL$2
Happened to have Tong Garden because it was close by$LABEL$3
good no-frills old-school chinese grub on the doudy eastern end of brookline boulevard.  some nicer lighting / interior design would do them well.  the space is dim/gloomy and just ... utilitarian ...  i guess you get what you pay for  ?  i love the mongolian beef and the hot n sour soup is delightful on a frigid cold winter day in pittsburgh ...$LABEL$3
Had the chicken kabob and hummus. Didnt enjoy either$LABEL$2
While I can't yelp but think that the music$LABEL$4
Worst service ever!!! We were a party of 10 had a reservation and you think they care about your reservation? Heck no!!! Waited for our table for an hour!!!! No body came check on us$LABEL$1
I'll second the other reviewer that said for the price charged$LABEL$2
This is a great find in Pittsburgh and out of the way.  Located on the back of Mt Washington$LABEL$4
Wonderful surprise in the South Hills desert of chain eateries. Romantic interior that's a refreshing throwback$LABEL$4
Local local local - working class excellence. People who value a good meal at a good price amongst friendly folk should make this a must-do. The interior is homey old-school but clean. The waitstaff knows - by name - many patrons. The owner is super nice and friendly and very hands-on. An addition into an adjacent space is in the works.One problem that cost a full star off the rating - only two beer selections on tap - think river water product. Other selections available in bottles$LABEL$3
This restaurant has a lovely atmosphere. It's beautifully decorated. Our server was attentive. We started out with a hummus platter. It was just ok$LABEL$4
As I stated before$LABEL$1
I go to fast food places a few times a year$LABEL$1
Friends and I were looking to order Chinese food on a Sunday afternoon. Unfortunately$LABEL$3
If you are looking for authentic Chinese food$LABEL$4
If you're seeking bland$LABEL$2
Nice interiors ...food's just like any other chinese restaurant offering$LABEL$3
We typically come over here for lunches which are always very good and relatively cheap. Personally I don't usually think of a dinner out at a Chinese Restaurant is going to be excellent but this place was Dyn-O-mite! We had reservations for 6 people on a Saturday night around 7:00 but got caught up in really bad traffic and couldn't make it until closer to 7:45. we called to adjust our reservation time and they had no issue to accommodate us. It is simple enough just to park across the street in the public lot than drive around for street parking I think that the lot may even be free on Saturday nights. The plate serving sizes are pretty large so it makes it easy for everyone to try a little of everything which is the way we ran the dinner with our group. We order way too much food to say the least. Everything was flavorful and served up[ hot and steamy. We had so many dishes that I can't talk about how awesome each one was but the one that really stood out to me was the mussaman curry and fried tofu.Usually with a group of 6 or more a smaller place like this might be overwhelmed with getting the plates out in a timely manner and relatively close together but this place did an excellent job. I will definitely put this place in my places to go for dinner file after this experience.$LABEL$4
This is my first yelp review. I set up a account just for this review.  I was deeply sadden by the food I received today. I first started coming here since 1993. I have moved to Midwest four years later. However$LABEL$1
BF and I went here at 9pm on a Friday night$LABEL$3
Some of the highest quality and best Chinese food you'll find in the area$LABEL$4
The oil to sauce ratio for my Kung pao chicken was 1:1 - maybe worse.  I couldn't eat it.  I literally had to rinse it off under hot water in order to salvage a few bites.  This isn't the first time that I have had this problem here.  Takeout is gross.  I won't be back.$LABEL$1
Went here recently with my husband and a friend. Luncheon buffet was already closed$LABEL$3
Currently sitting in the restaurant. Got seated very quickly$LABEL$1
So just finished my meal with my family here and I will not go back! The waitress who I don't know her name because it was never shared was polite and efficient. The only redeeming quality I found in the meal was my 2 glasses of wine! Not that the food was bad it just wasn't good! I ordered Moo Shoo Pork with 4 \""Chinese\"" pancakes. Once it arrived I was looking forward to it as the main dish looked appetizing. Then I opened my \""Chinese\"" pancakes... OMG they served me steamed tortillas! I was expecting the crepe style Chinese pancakes and instead I had flour tortillas steamed!!! Growing up and just having moved to Pittsburgh from the West Coast I KNOW a tortilla when I'm served one and it wasn't even handmade freshly cooked tortillas that you get at a chain joint like Chevy's but pull em out of the bag from Giant Eagle tortilla! This not only killed the meal but when the $100.00+ tab came I was aghast! My wife and two kiddos had decent meals but just because you serve large portions doesn't mean you're serving 100 dollars worth of food! I felts cheated by high prices for mediocre chinese (notice the little C) food from a place that used to be rated as  great Chinese restaurant but that was back in 1996 as the plaques on the wall gleefully point out; but only seem to notice on your way out!$LABEL$1
My buddy wrote to me and said I should do a review of Mark Pi's China Gate. To be completely honest$LABEL$4
Eh$LABEL$3
Their food is delicious!  They also have fresh sushi. The only thing I've had that I have not cared for is their hibatchi. I had the hibatchi chicken and my friend had hibatchi shrimp. They were both dry. We were disappointed because normally the food is outstanding. Lesson learned. Stick to the Chef's specialties and the sushi.$LABEL$4
My son and I stopped by China Gate after a movie in the Galleria.  We had eaten there before when it was called Mark Pi's China Gate.  The food was very good.  I think it's changed hands and here's why.  We were seated and given menus.  We placed our order with the waiter and not less than 3 minutes later$LABEL$1
I was actually surprised whenever I checked into China Gate and it had a lower than average rating. I was curious as to how my meal was going to be because I've had some bad Chinese before.My friend Brandi & I did painting with a twist at the Galleria during the mall's art week. She had been to China Gate before and explained to me how cute it was$LABEL$3
Firstly$LABEL$4
I've had good color and styling services here. Force yourself to look past the giant$LABEL$4
Horrible experience!!! I wouldn't suggest this salon to my worst enemy!! Spent close to 4 hours there for highlights and a haircut!!! May of taken so long because$LABEL$1
I bought a guitar online$LABEL$4
One star for the unpleasant experience I have had at this store. I was treated very poorly by a particular gentleman with an unjustified ego who was working the counter. He dismissed my honest inquiry in a very rude and unprofessional manner. It seems as though he would only care to cater to the experienced musicians who enter his shop. It's a shame he could not assist me with some grace and respect. Because of him$LABEL$1
Okay$LABEL$4
Il Pizzaiolo serves authentic and delicious pizza and pasta.  I highly$LABEL$5
Probably one of the best places to eat pasta or wood-fired pizza...$LABEL$5
We were so excited to try Il Pizzaiolo after hearing about it from so many people and reviews online.  We discovered after arriving that they will accept cash only until further notice.  Apparently this isn't a temporary problem because I saw the same sign on the door a few weeks ago$LABEL$1
WTF?  How does this place get so highly rated on Yelp?  It's not awful$LABEL$3
After eating at Bistro 19 I was very excited when I saw that Il Pizzaiolo was right next door.  I had thought about eating here in the past but was always put off by the location.  That being said$LABEL$2
Dinner& Movie: After the downpour$LABEL$2
Full review with pictures in blog: Greeted by our server$LABEL$5
You won't find more authentic$LABEL$3
After living in Italy for 7 months during my college years I can say that I have a voice in the discussion of what first-rate Italian should taste like. Just so you all know I have tried almost every dish on the menu but will stick to what in my opinion is the best. I did not leave 5 stars because I do think it is a bit overpriced. The last time I went my server was really impatient and snobby when I was asking questions and trying to decide on the wine.  I arrived before the dinner rush on my birthday so I could take the time to really dine with my boyfriend. Why I crave Pizzaiolo? Mozzarella di bufala. I know for a fact that every Thursday they fly in many choice ingredients directly from Italia. This creamy delicacy is by far my best loved. It either comes on the DOC Margherita pizza or mixed in with some of the pasta selections. I always order the DOC as an appetizer then the Rigatoni Alla Siciliana. They also only use San Marzano tomatoes in the marinara sauces which introduces a bold rich flavor without as much acidity. The key to these dense$LABEL$4
Growing up in Mt. Lebanon$LABEL$2
Pasta is my second language. Eating pasta is my sport! With that said$LABEL$5
Still one of my all time favorite places to eat!!! I now live in New York City and haven't found anything like Pizzaiolo. This place is a real treasure!$LABEL$5
The appetizer was bruschetta.  Essentially three pieces of toast with various toppings.  Two of the three were good$LABEL$2
Mt. Lebanon is such a cute little town! I was so happy we chose to eat dinner there$LABEL$3
Excellent thin crust pizza served in a pleasant rustic Tuscany style restaurant along with the Pizza we enjoyed a very nice caesar salad with anchovy and a fresh zesty citrus dressingThe wine list is also very good$LABEL$4
Have I found my new favorite date spot? My fianc\u00e9e and I just enjoyed dinner here last night and we were thrilled with every part of our experience at Il Pizzaiolo. We showed up pretty late$LABEL$5
Way overpriced for just ok food.  On a Tuesday night$LABEL$2
This place has the best pizza I've ever had besides Keste and Paulie Gs in NYC.  Wood fired greatness.  Expect to wait on weekends in a crowded wine bar.  FANTASTIC red sauce and olive oil.  Not extensive on the wine list but good by the glass selection. A gem in Pittsburgh.$LABEL$5
Tucked in a corner table in their wine/back house location was cozy given the rain pour happening outside. I ordered a chianti to start and then we ordered the vegetable app dish to share$LABEL$3
Now$LABEL$5
The most delicious pizza and the best cocktails in the area!! Such friendly staff!! I've always had an amazing experience!!$LABEL$5
In town to visit our daughter at Pitt.  Her roommate works here in the summer and recommended it for us.  Sat outside on the back patio.  Beautiful night and it was a great little place to sit.  First thing I noticed was they had Nora$LABEL$4
I have always held this place in high regard$LABEL$2
On my second adventure to this wonderful restaurant$LABEL$5
Il piz$LABEL$2
Ok...so$LABEL$2
Highly recommended.We ate in the \""wine bar\$LABEL$4
Rating is based largely on the snottiness of the staff.  We weren't sure if children or non-locals were not appreciated.  We walked into a virtually empty restaurant at 6 on a Monday; got the once over; and the hostess said \""i hope you have a reservation.  We have a big crowd at 6:30. You can wait for 45 minutes at the wine bar.\"" We walked outside and easily booked a reservation on Open Table for 6:15$LABEL$2
II Pizzaiolo has long been on my radar as a new place to try.  Who doesn't love a little Italian?  (Well$LABEL$3
I have tried II Pizzaiolo twice now and I am not a fan. The food was very good but over priced and the atmosphere is stuffy and very loud. If you are looking for a relaxing night out$LABEL$2
I actually really enjoy the wine bar behind the actual restaurant. Since it is considered a wine bar in that particular portion of the restaurant$LABEL$2
Excellent Italian restaurant. We ate in the wine bar behind the actual restaurant which was very nice and cozy. We shared the sea bass and eggplant parmesan. Portions were generous and the food was excellent. The eggplant parmesean was the best I have had and rather than the frequently found thin slices of breaded eggplant$LABEL$5
I'm not sure what the Mt.Lebo hype is about this place. The portions are small$LABEL$2
I always used to make sure to have dinner here during my yearly visits to Pittsburgh.This will be the last time as the food was mediocre and the restaurant  looked like it was neglected. There are many new and better restaurants to choose from.The sad state this once cutting edge restaurant devolved into is a real shame as it used to be one of Pittsburgh's best.$LABEL$2
I wanted to give this place a \""5\"" but then thought \""they should be more generous with their fresh basil this time of year.\""  (After this past winter we are really craving our Summer herb garden).  This is not an indictment of the quality of the food or experience as all portions were wonderfully seasoned and the staff was overly competent and nice/non-pretentious.  I enjoyed the Italian food menu and Italian wine/beer menu.  I'm not religious but I said a quiet \""thank-you\"" to the stars for not letting us walk out of the place when we were told we would have a 10 minute wait.   It was a Friday night (and we expected some congestion uptown).  We were redirected to wait in the adjacent wine bar$LABEL$4
This used to be one of my absolute favorite places to eat. However I had such horrible service here on my last outing that I will NEVER return here again. The server was rude and ungrateful. She reminded me of Lindsay Lohan filming her reality show.The atmosphere in the wine bar is fabulous and the food is decent. I really like the pizza and marinated vegetables. The meatballs are also excellent. Sadly I cannot support a business that provides such poor service.$LABEL$2
They no longer cut your pizza for you.  Instead$LABEL$3
$20 for a personal pizza with cherry tomatoes$LABEL$2
Just way to expensive for what it is. It's good but not at the prices they choose. $9 for wedding soup? It was good$LABEL$2
I've found a new lover$LABEL$4
First of all$LABEL$5
Extremely pleased! Loved the bread at the table$LABEL$5
We live close by and wanted to check this place out. Nothing was overly amazing but the food was decent. Decor is your typical Tuscan style and the wood fire oven is interesting to watch. I had one of the veal dishes which reminded me a lot of Chicken Marsala and cost $28. There was no sides$LABEL$3
Great sushi bar. The staff and owner are extremely attentive. Great presentation. Decent price too. And I got to sit next to Mario Lemeuix at lunch a couple weeks ago!$LABEL$5
I think this restaurant fits american taste. Because i was the only non american to eat here just now$LABEL$2
Awesome sushi. Nigiri sushi here is a must-try.$LABEL$5
With prices this cheap$LABEL$2
Love Little Tokyo. Dedicated customers keep the place full all week long and on the weekends. If cleanliness is important to you$LABEL$5
Best fresh sushi in town. Their prices are great and the service is good. They also own the Little Tokyo in South Side and both places are awesome.$LABEL$5
I love this place!! I'm not a sushi fan$LABEL$5
Let's face it$LABEL$2
Good experience$LABEL$4
I came here craving some sushi.  Looked up the best reviewed sushi place in my area and found this little restaurant.  I was excited at the front because it was a small restaurant and I love supporting small mom and pops.  I figured this may be a little diamond in the rough.  Man$LABEL$2
Hands down$LABEL$5
Always a good sushi spot.  I've had sushi a lot of different places in Pittsburgh and Little Tokyo in Mt Lebanon always hits the spot.  I'd consider in the top three. My wife and I had miso soup and the green salad as appetizers.  Both good$LABEL$4
Craving sushi? Then this is the place to go. It's well worth the drive to Mt. Lebanon. I wouldn't be surprised to find out that the fish was flown in multiple times a day.  It's always so fresh. The sushi gets 5 stars.The staff is also incredible. The owner goes out of his way to walk around and check on tables. It is very clear that he wants every guest to have an enjoyable dining experience. However$LABEL$4
Meh. The outside and insides are nice and trendy$LABEL$3
Chopsticks down the best sushi in the burgh.  Consistently good.$LABEL$5
Love their sushi here. You can't go wrong with anything on the menu. There is on street parking$LABEL$5
Coming from the west coast$LABEL$1
Food was good$LABEL$2
This is amazing sushi.  I have not tried the hibachi but it is nice that they have it for dining with a mixed sushi/non sushi eating crowd.  The sushi is spectacular and there is high attention to detail.  The miso soup is made completely from scratch$LABEL$5
OK$LABEL$2
Best sushi ever$LABEL$5
I did not have a good experience here tonight. We did not make reservations and got seated within 10 minutes! We were happy about that but.. Waiting for our food took so long! We were ready to walk out and just cancel the order because of the wait.. But ended up waiting it out. The food turned out okay. Miso soup- needed scallions and seaweedSalad- the dressing wasn't gingerly enough and tasted like Italian dressing. - the agedashi tofu was not agedashi tofu.. It was fried tofu in soy sauce with red pickled Chinese chilli. Ugh.. So disappointed. - sushi was okay. It was just average for me.  They were definitely quick with the check and cleaning at the end! Overall$LABEL$2
Best pizza in the 'Burg! They definitely don't skimp on the cheese and the sauce is awesome....it has a fresh tomato taste to it that goes well with the crisp$LABEL$5
This pizza is a classic!  If you visit Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
Stopped in for a couple quick slices of plain red sauce.  $1.60 each.  They were really great.  I loved the sauce$LABEL$4
Overall: One of Pittsburgh's better pies$LABEL$3
Been going to Mineo's for the longest time I can remember. Good pizza but certainly not the best one around town! Cash only though!$LABEL$3
Great pizza$LABEL$5
Horrible.  Tried it several times.  Taste like frozen Pizza.  Found a hair in it the first time so against my better judgement tried it again.  I swear it was worse than my first experience.  The locals that like this joint must have smoker destroyed taste buds.$LABEL$1
Got an amazing facial here. I have been there for a pedicure and massage in the past. It's great.$LABEL$5
I have been going here for hair cuts and color for years! Wonderful stylists - very professional and well trained. They also have other services...full spa$LABEL$5
I think it's some sort of law that if you live in Lebo and have young kids$LABEL$3
Some good some bad.  This goes for the food and the service.  You MUST check your order if it's to go in any of the locations.  I have had more mistakes than correct orders in the last year or so.  The \""presses\"" are MICROWAVES.  They are not training their employees to know this and they are not making it public.  I had an employee actually argue about it with me this morning because I wanted them to toast my bagel and assemble the egg and cheese without nuking it.  I got to my car and they had forgotten the cheese.  I went back and the cook told me that the counter person didn't know if I wanted it!  I think someone should have double checked if this was the case as the sandwich comes with cheese to begin with.Even Burger King doesn't microwave their breakfast!$LABEL$2
Asian Sesame Chicken Salad is my favorite 'healthy' lunch.$LABEL$4
I went to five bridal salons before finding my dress$LABEL$2
I had my first bridal gown experience at Anne Gregory. The entire staff there made me feel beautiful and comfortable throughout my entire appointment. They were able to pick dresses that matched my style and personality and every dress was stunning! I found my gown in a matter of 45 minutes and didn't want to take it off! It is a beautiful Monique Lhuillier! I highly recommend going to Anne Gregory for your bridal experience- it was a stress free and exciting day!$LABEL$5
I ended up at Anne Gregory because they were the only place in Pittsburgh having a trunk show with a dress I saw online and really wanted to try on.  My maid of honor maid the appointment and a couple of my bridesmaids$LABEL$5
This should say it all: we found a dress we loved$LABEL$1
Dreadful$LABEL$1
When I walked into this store I thought they may be going out of business.  They have a ton of display cases but barely anything in them.  Weird. We tried the cupcakes$LABEL$3
Even though the baked goods are not made on the premises here - they are brought in from the main Dormont location - it smells like a bakery should.  There was so much to choose from - fresh baked bread$LABEL$4
Potomac Bakery is pretty darn wonderful - this is one of the places my family will often go to when we need a cake or cookies for special events. Everything is always fresh and the dough and icing or other toppings always taste really good$LABEL$4
This theatre definitely needs a re-haul!  The theatre is older and doesn't have stadium seating or some of the better amenities that the newer theatres are offering such as an expanded menu.  While I prefer going to the theatre located closer to the South Hills Village mall$LABEL$2
This is a crappy$LABEL$1
Way worse than what I remember as a kid$LABEL$2
Such a shame. Terrific location$LABEL$2
Why does this place always smell bad? Seriously$LABEL$1
Really good burgers!$LABEL$5
This is the sports bar I have been looking for since I moved to Pittsburgh! I only wish it was closer!We checked this place out on Saturday. We were dressed up because we were attending a reception for a wedding later on and we were just trying to kill time. There weren't too many people in there and majority of the TVs were focused on the Pitt game with a few other games sprinkled throughout. First win: PUMKING! I am seriously in love with that stuff. The bartender was incredibly nice and funny and social$LABEL$5
This is a decent sports bar - good selection of beer with your usual bar food menu. The drink and food prices are very reasonable for the area - also they do have happy hour specials from time to time. I come here mostly during the hockey season to watch the pens game and also may be because I live only a few blocks away from the bar. Most of those who come here are usually locals from the South Hills Area. Although it's a bar$LABEL$3
There's two saloons in the South Hills. I was confused between Cain's and The Saloon of Mt. Lebo because they're both the \""Saloon.\"" Maybe it's like the Wild Wild West and they're feuding. In any case...If it were to that angle$LABEL$4
I have been robbed twice by the Saloon.  Someone there likes to write in tips so if you use a credit or debit card at the Saloon make ABSOLUTELY sure that you check you bank statement the next day. After the first time I wrote it up as a mistake on my part or their but the last time I was flabbergasted.  I went in on some Yeungling special night$LABEL$1
This place is just okay.  Food isn't that great.  It's kind of dark & dingy.  Lots of TV's though.  I prefer Cain's Saloon...just right down the road.$LABEL$2
If you are close to the area and you simply want a cheap beer with friends on a cold night$LABEL$2
Decent bar atmosphere with dark wood and tavern like feel to it.  Being that it is a bar$LABEL$2
So this place is a smoker friendly pub$LABEL$1
This place is two separate businesses. One is a retail shop which is very nice and typical cigar store. Many varieties. The other part is a cigar bar which serves alcohol and snack food. Nice area but small. When its crowded$LABEL$3
At the pub/restaurant side I had a very bad experience$LABEL$1
I didn't realize this place even existed as a pub until a friend mentioned about their happy hour special - despite being right across Houlihans.Like the previous review said - this place is basically a tobacco shop that has a pub attached to it. The shop has a good collection of cigars and pipes. Although not a smoker - I've been here couple times with a friend (cigar smoker) for few drinks/cigar after work. The times I've been there - I've seen mostly older crowds.If you can't stand the smoke or the smell - then this is not the place for you.$LABEL$3
I have been going here for years to buy cigars.....even when they were upstairs in the mall. But I have always been a little skeptical about the bar(I am a drinker) and the premise under which they exist. They offered no food for sale today$LABEL$1
This place is huge and very convenient to our home.  I like to frequent locally owned businesses so I was excited to try Rollier's instead of going to the Home Depot down the street.  Unfortunately this store is considerably more expensive and has a much smaller selection of items.  I know this is to be expected$LABEL$3
I've gone to Rollier's a lot over the years whenever I needed a personal touch - something you can't get at places like Home Depot.  Last week I went in with a busted window screen frame.  I wanted to replace it$LABEL$1
Have a home project or problem...ask the experts at Rolliers.  They can help you fix it or they repair many things like screens and lamps.Need seasonal lights and decorations.  Rolliers has it.  Check out the Xmas display of Studio 56 stuff!  The kids love it!  Big kids Too!Great place to pick up items and get assistance.  Need some work cloths$LABEL$5
Rollier's is exactly everything that I can remember about the local hardware store when I was growing up. I'm certain that they have someone named \""Chuck\"" that knows the answer to any of your household projects. This place has a wide variety of items that you can use to complete most of your home projects but it is not all encompassing. For the most part their prices are right on point maybe a little on the high side but I figure that since most of the people there can find someone who can give you some real advice on your home project it is worth the slight mark-up. Although I have been mostly satisfied with Rollier's I have had a number of less than desirable experiences ranging from rudeness to being outright ripped off. Example I was sold a sink faucet spray hose that was not new$LABEL$3
So here's the thing... we bought a house in Dormont and it was so nice to discover a \""larger\"" hardware store that wasn't a big box name. Plus$LABEL$2
Imagine those hardware stores you see on tv / movies where the you can go and know that you will get reliable help$LABEL$5
Yes$LABEL$4
The Korner Pub is a delightful little dive with the perfect mix of classic Pittsburgh dive and craft brew haven. I grew up near this bar$LABEL$5
If you're looking for a place to grab some good beer$LABEL$3
Boring pretentious mall with old dated stores$LABEL$1
I haven't been to this mall in forever; in fact$LABEL$4
Yay review #300!And I'm giving Galleria mall a 3 to celebrate! J/k.It's like South Hlls Village but smaller and more expensive. That is all. I'm not sure I'd come back to shop. Maybe to eat$LABEL$3
I don't frequent the Galleria very much but go to their movie theater every once in a while.  The theater is outdated and old - you would think for their target clientele they would give the movie theater an upgrade.  The stores that I enjoy here include$LABEL$2
Ohhh the Galleria....  the mall where there is a 100% chance I'm going to find something I want to buy and a 0% chance I'll be able to afford it.If I am going out for dinner and a movie though$LABEL$4
Oh the Galleria...I've always considered this mall to be the smaller but more expensive sister to the South Hills Village mall just up the street. How much more expensive? Enough that the Galleria is typically window shopping only for me...On the plus side$LABEL$3
Racist mall management team same team that ran century 3 mall in to the ground stay away nothing good comes out this place$LABEL$1
I remember when we first started going to the Galleria years ago it was a very quiet if not \""dead\"" mall.  There seemed to be very few people in this mall at the time but the last few times we went it has been quite busy.  A good indicator on how busy it is or was is how much parking was available at the front of the mall (the Starbucks entrance) versus having to go into the garage section.  Back in the day there always seemed to be parking at the front now it seems we had a harder time trying to park at the front.Been to Bravo once$LABEL$3
I think A-Ok is a good way to put this mall. I should also add that i didn't get to venture around because I was here for Painting with a Twist. After eating dinner we had just enough time to head down to our painting class.As for stores$LABEL$3
Here's the short version: Beware of using a camera in the Galleria! You are likely to become the target of the mall cop and be harassed no matter how innocent your use happened to be$LABEL$1
Pittsburgh Restoration Hardware has the worst customer service ..stay away.$LABEL$1
Been there twice so far and have to say Maggie is so sweet and very knowledgeable. She listens to your concerns and gives you advice outside of acupuncture to help with your problem. The office is very clean and easily accessible to anyone who lives in the south hills.$LABEL$5
No one's reviewed this place? I would think this salon would attract a rather high concentration of Yelpers$LABEL$4
Meh. Massages are good$LABEL$3
I love this La Pomponnee wayyyyy more than the peters township one. It's less cluttered and everyone is really friendly.My stylist is Jessica and I can't say enough good things about her. I think she is one of their junior stylists but she gives a great haircut! She actually listens and she doesn't push products on you. However I loved how she styled my hair so I ended up buying everything she used because I needed products and you know I have seen a huge difference in my hair. She even told me some cute ways to style my hair which is great for me cause my hair is a pain! I spent around $100 on products and for a haircut$LABEL$4
Worst experience with a hairdresser ever$LABEL$1
La Pomponnee$LABEL$2
I went here for the first time on a recommendation. I did not request a specific stylist$LABEL$1
With the colder weather picking up in the Pittsburgh area - it's easy to get dry wind-chapped skin and to just want to stay indoors.La Pomponee not only will nourish your skin with lovely all natural products and a soft touch - but they'll have you looking so radiant that you'll be aching to take your glowing cheeks out.I came here with my mom when we were visiting my brother and all of their staff were exceptionally friendly and helpful.They provided lush robes$LABEL$4
Not the best haircut$LABEL$3
I started going to this salon when I moved to Mt Lebanon. It's very classy and chic. My stylist is Aaron$LABEL$4
This place SUCKS.  The pharmacist and his assistants are EXTREMELY condescending and prejudiced about older people.  My sister's friend was treated extremely horribly by these people and they never apologized$LABEL$1
Great quality furniture and shower curtains but way to overpriced for example a shower curtain is $90 there and some of the employees including the manager gather in a group and just talk. I went there tonight and all I had to do was return a towel and buy a couple new ones and it took me 40 minutes to do that$LABEL$3
I don't think the drinks are as good as Aldo down the street$LABEL$3
I like Uptown Coffee! They're like the \""little guy\"" to the one down the street but they've got a much cooler vibe. They have a bakery on site and have some killer treats. I just wished they would brew their ice coffee a little stronger. I hate it when coffee joints just stick a batch of regular coffee in the fridge. It needs to be brewed via the seeping process$LABEL$4
I would be horrified if someone tallied up the hours I spent here hanging out after school$LABEL$3
Weird experience.  I asked what they use for their Chai Latte and they said they have their own \""mix.\""  I'm here to tell you... I have no clue what they gave me.  I felt like it was peppermint spiced tea$LABEL$2
It's hard to argue with the delicious$LABEL$5
My weekly group of meditation buddies and I often stop here post Om. Most of them are tea drinkers$LABEL$4
The best little coffee shop in Pittsburgh!The atmosphere is great!  The baristas are super friendly (the one woman is the most cheerful$LABEL$5
Mediocre sandwiches and milk shakes. Also$LABEL$2
I am writing an update to Magee Women's Hospital.  My attitude towards them has not changed.  This is still the best place for a woman to get healthcare$LABEL$5
I am currently 30 weeks pregnant and go to Magee's Out patient clinic for my prenatal care.  I do love it$LABEL$3
Wish there was a choice of NO stars.  I was in this hospital for 5 very long days and it was a HORRIBLE experience.  I had a kidney infection and pneumonia and had to spend the first night in ER.  No rooms available.  There was no noise control so sleep was impossible.  Finally got a room the next day only to be kicked out because they shut the ward down over the weekend (!).  Absurd.  All I wanted was sleep - so they put me in a room full of loud visitors (I was supposed to have a private room).  Horrible experience.$LABEL$1
This is a fun shoe store in a great neighborhood. Prices are reasonable. The selection is great$LABEL$4
The place has a quaint look about it$LABEL$1
I really want to like this store. I like most of the stock they have and they are always changing it up with the current styles. They always have really good sales going on! What I didn't like was the service. I went in and I was greeted with a friendly hello. I checked out the stuff they had in stock perusing the shelves looking for my size. When I couldn't find anything my size I asked the older gentlemen if he could point out the shoes they carry in my size (5 1/2.) Now I know my size isn't average but I imagine this to be a specialty store and a small business geared towards the satisfaction of it's customers. The guy said not only do they only have what was in the sale section - which when I tried it on he went on to even say they were too big for me - but they are getting less and less in my size and don't plan on ordering more  5 1/2s.Really?! Wouldn't you want the sale? Try to at least offer to order the shoe I was interested in for me which would make me want to visit this store again and give them future business? I know it's a hassle to special order things and running the risk of a customer not purchasing the item. I hate to compare business's but I know Little's in Squirrel Hill does it$LABEL$3
This place offers a sliver of charm for those who shop/stroll along Walnut St. and want to drop in for an espresso. It has a big clear garage window which is always open when weather permits - and this allows for good people watching. Nevertheless$LABEL$2
I was a fan for years of the Coffee Tree in spite of the lack of seating due to endless working students with laptops. I changed my mind when twice in  a row when I asked for a spare paper cup to split my coffee with my wife I was told -- we dont do that. Starbucks does and is a lot friendlier. I hate to down local companies but Coffee Roasters is acting like a franchise not a local coffee shop.$LABEL$1
Coffee Tree offers a number of different places to sit - the open coffee shop with the huge garage doors or back by the fire on the couches.  The coffee is okay$LABEL$2
I like the look of this Coffee Tree Roasters location more than anything else.  If you like people watching on a nice day$LABEL$2
I think all of the reviews here are spot on.  I spend a lot of time there studying$LABEL$3
Great coffee house in a great neighborhood.  I really like the 'quiet room' in the back$LABEL$4
The vanilla lattes are a little sweet$LABEL$5
Went with my roommate when we were searching for some nighttime wi-fi (our dorm didn't have it yet$LABEL$3
I love coffee and any place that serves it. Shadyside is one of my favorite neighborhoods in the city$LABEL$4
A solid place to start a roadtrip$LABEL$4
This place just keeps getting worse and worse.  I've been in Pgh for a while now and honestly$LABEL$2
Let's talk about the weird interaction I had with a Barista here.  I asked if they offered free internet.  Simple question$LABEL$2
+ Latte was excellent$LABEL$4
The coffee here is excellent. I usually have their iced or hot mochas which are extremely rich and chocolatey.  Their lattes and regular coffee blends are also quite nice and their chai lattes can be light and refreshing. The decor is very chill traditional coffee house style with small tables and a good amount of space considering the other neighborhood shops. The brick interior is cozy  and cool and they open the front garage door-style window on nice days so it's practically like you're out on the street. Very cool place to just chill and do homework or meet with friends. Parking can be difficult$LABEL$4
Flavorful not bitter I have only had a double espresso iced & a regular I enjoyed it$LABEL$4
Great interactions$LABEL$3
It's another Saturday evening of salted-pretzel chocolate-chip cookies with coffee at Coffee Tree Roasters--Shadyside.  My cookie is stale$LABEL$2
Not a huge fan of Coffee Tree Roaster coffee.  It's really sour for my taste$LABEL$3
It's a popular place to hang out on Walnut st$LABEL$4
This was my official neighborhood coffee shop while I lived right down the road on Walnut for 3 years. It's located right in the heart of Shadyside$LABEL$4
The coffee is on par with the other chains in Pittsburgh. I liked the open storefront and the quiet study room in the back. Also$LABEL$3
Great place to read or just have a break from the day. Large bay doors are great for letting in sun and fresh air. Typical price range of Starbucks or Caribou with a similar layout as well.$LABEL$4
Drinks: 3Decor: 4.5Ambiance: 5Service: 3.5Value: 4$LABEL$4
It's very inconsistent here in terms of barista skills$LABEL$3
OMG. Mr. Barista. Your not in Seattle. I Live Pacific Northwest.  I'm not a coffee snob I can do with it or without it. But it seemed like I was absolutely bothering the staff this morning. Check the date.  Ordered mocha and a scone.  And got a look.  I'm not a shady side hipster but an average person in workout gear. Felt like I was in someone else's hood.  Get over yourselves people.  Your in Pittsburgh.$LABEL$2
Good coffee and tea$LABEL$3
Do you enjoy loud$LABEL$3
Lots of seating area$LABEL$3
Coffee Tree Roasters is NOT a place to study and get work done.  It's a good place for an hour long meeting or something like that.  It's too loud for work$LABEL$3
i must be missing something because this place seemed expensive for dry cleaning.  they outsource the dry cleaning and didn't really make recommendations on any of my garmets.  i've gone to cleaners before that will tell me to wash over dry clean or startch$LABEL$2
Very nice inside with a great atmosphere.   Turn around was quick and staff was friendly.  I got a white comforter dry cleaned and while it didn't as clean as I had hoped$LABEL$4
What can I say about a laundromat? It's clean and well staffed$LABEL$5
Love love love this place$LABEL$4
The Laundry Factory is no longer the clean$LABEL$1
Came to this location based on other popular Yelp reviews and was very satisfied. The location is very clean and reasonably priced. The staff seemed very friendly although I did not have to personally interact with them. One issue might be availability of machines during peak times. My visit was around 3:00pm on a Saturday and I had no issues. There is free WIFI too! Overall$LABEL$5
Clean very clean present people $2.10 for shirts and I hate doing launder at a mat but if I have to then I will do it hear.  It's worth the extra buck to do it some where thats clean has WiFi a tv for the game and is right next to a bottle shop and a bar. Ok everything is stainless.$LABEL$5
I do wash and fold. I've never used a wash a fold service before in my life$LABEL$3
If i could give this place less than one star I would.  First$LABEL$1
Oh$LABEL$5
I've put off reviewing this place for months now$LABEL$4
i'm a total fan of eons. love their selection! a little pricey though.$LABEL$4
Sometimes I come all the way to Pittsburgh from Akron JUST to visit Eons.  The employees are friendly & knowledgeable.  The clothing is very well organized$LABEL$5
I lovvvvve this place. It's really well organized$LABEL$5
Meticulously organized and a great selection. Definitely worth a stop.$LABEL$5
Good selection$LABEL$4
Mostly 1960s-1980s stuff. A few pieces from the 1940s and 1950s and nothing earlier (clothes-wise anyway$LABEL$3
A nice place to stop in if you're out for a stroll in shadyside. Though I think this place is overpriced and a bit overrated$LABEL$3
You simply have to visit this shop$LABEL$5
I went here once when I first moved to Pittsburgh. My shirts came back poorly pressed and some had broken buttons. I was disappointed.$LABEL$2
I am not a fan of this place.  They are certainly convenient for Shadyside$LABEL$2
I went here once to get my pants hemmed and got yelled at for not purchasing proper pants in the first place. I was too startled to respond but have since thought of many  witty replies. Oh well.$LABEL$1
Please do not give them business. Owen's has the worst customer service and quality of service. You are better off going to another nearby dry cleaner. First$LABEL$1
Do not use this cleaner.  Quality is poor. They ruined three shirts of mine$LABEL$1
Have been waiting for +10 business shirts and suits for over 2 weeks. The manager is uncertain whether my clothes will be ready in another week or two. The last batch of dry cleaning came back pressed with wrinkles. Had to send it back. Customer service is poor. I would strongly recommend you not use Owen's Dry Cleaners.$LABEL$1
This place is terrible.  Customer service is sub-par.  I took 10 shirts in on a saturday.  They were supposed to be ready on the following thursday$LABEL$1
THE place that I went for a nice conversation + cocktail combo in the 'burgh. Great atmosphere$LABEL$5
Only went here for drinks$LABEL$4
Good beer specials when I've had their beer specials for the night.  Appetizers & entrees are usually perfectly sized$LABEL$5
A great way to spend the night.  Loved the seafood salad with soba noodles.   Asian cloppino and the filet have never disappointed.  Would love to try everything on the menu.$LABEL$5
I don't see the big deal about Soba Lounge. I thought the food was only okay$LABEL$2
I have only eaten a full meal in the dining room once; but I have ordered appetizers and drinks in the comfortable bar area more than a handful of times. On the occasion of the dinner$LABEL$4
I love Soba. I started off with their signature dirty martini.  They make it with this fancy pickle juice and Hendricks gin.  Lucky for Soba I moved to solid foods after two of those on an empty stomach.  I slurred my dinner order of the pork belly$LABEL$4
ANOTHER GOOD EATERY FROM THE BIG BURRITO GROUP.We went to celebrate my bros girlfriends b-day. BECAUSE if you sign up for the big burrito birthday club you get a yearly $30 birthday voucher for most of the big burrito restaurants!!! Any who...this place has a high end warm feeling. Menu had alot to choose from in the way of Asian fusion. We tried the calamari which was good. Chopped salad was refreshing but not everyone at the table liked it. I had scallops - large and well cooked. Dessert was show only. The cashew terrine was so so. I would love to try more of the small plates. I felt the entire place was good enough to visit again.$LABEL$3
There have only been two superb fusion restaurants that I have been to in the world. There have been quite a few that were average and some that down right stunk. The problem with most fusion places that they rely on the principal that the sum will equal more than the parts and therefore$LABEL$4
For a fusion restaurant$LABEL$3
The food is really good here$LABEL$4
Fusion is difficult to pull off well.  Have you ever noticed that \""Fusion\"" almost always involves East Asian food and American cuisine.  Thai corn chowder?  Are they really going crazy for corn chowder in Chang Mai?You never find$LABEL$4
So underwhelming. I've been here a few times and have always been disappointed. Last night the service was especially lackluster. And the kitchen closed and 10$LABEL$2
This was the last stop on the \""Brother Visits Ne'er Do Well Kid Sister and Treats Her to Meals\"" tour.We started with the Indonesian corn fritter wraps$LABEL$4
I can't stress how incredible the Big Burrito group is. They deserve prizes.I came to Soba with two friends for the Oc Om Boc festival$LABEL$4
So the majority of my food was good here$LABEL$2
If you are like me$LABEL$5
I've been to Soba twice and it was my first real experience with \""upscale\"" dining.The inside is great$LABEL$4
Oh Soba... Always a tasty experience$LABEL$3
I give this place an OKAY because I've had mixed experiences. The first time I went it was okay$LABEL$2
Had dinner at Soba on a Thursday night with a friend.  Went around 6pm$LABEL$4
Soba Saturday night after Art All Night! Whew there were so many people in Lawrenceville! It was impossible to get in anywhere and my group wasn't willing to stand outside in the brisk air just to get in and have to fight for seating or even a drink. Soba was the perfect choice! Love$LABEL$5
Dude.  Pittsburgh.  Who knew you had such a refined and sexy dining scene???Well$LABEL$5
My boyfriend took me out to dinner at Soba Lounge for my birthday last week!  We had reservations for 7 pm on a Thursday evening$LABEL$4
Pan-Asian fusion.  That designation usually means fancy Chinese food at high-end prices. Even in Boston and Chicago$LABEL$4
I hate to put two stars$LABEL$2
I have dinned Soba on multiple occasions and it never disappoints.  I really like the decor (very fitting for menu served) and the wait staff is very knowledgeable about the menu. Since my standard practice is to ask what their favorite dishes and the most popular dishes are$LABEL$5
I was so disappointed with the quality... the salad was drenched in vinegar$LABEL$1
Soba delivered again! One of the perks of being on the Big Burrito mailing list is the postcard they send every year at your birthday time for a free entree. I like to celebrate my birthday with some good food in the company of friends$LABEL$4
I'm usually a fan of what Big Burrito does around Pittsburgh$LABEL$3
Dear Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
I went to Soba with some co-workers on a work trip to Pittsburgh. The wine selection was pretty impressive (there was something for every taste) and the food was good. Not the best pad thai I've ever eaten (pretty dry$LABEL$3
Soba is another restaurant in the Big Burrito group's offerings and absolutely another hit. It's located in Shadyside$LABEL$4
Soba is hit or miss for me. The cocktails are awesome$LABEL$3
I have dined at Soba more times than any other restaurant in Pittsburgh; it is my favorite! The dishes are original and creative$LABEL$4
I would prefer to leave 2.5 stars.  I ordered the kimchi pancakes and a salad I think.  The pancakes were ok$LABEL$2
Loved it! Great vibe.$LABEL$5
I've been to Soba Lounge before$LABEL$2
The bar and restaurant has nice decor. Very upbeat. The calamari was good but not exceptional. The Chaing Mai curry was so spicy hot I couldn't eat it. The service was unattentive.  Has potential but presently over rated.$LABEL$3
Love love love this place. They did an amazing job. Favorite place for happy hour.$LABEL$5
I love coming to Soba -- everything I have ever had here has been wonderful$LABEL$5
We made an 8:30 reservation at 8:15$LABEL$4
Ambience was beautiful but main dishes were not as good as appetizers. Rice was incredibly salty$LABEL$3
Went to Soba to celebrate my sons birthday. Quality of food was not at all what was expected for the price. We have eaten there several times in the past but not sure that we will be going back anytime soon.$LABEL$2
I came here around 9:30 pm on a Friday and had a reservation even though there appeared to be some open tables. The drinks are worth it$LABEL$3
My boyfriend and I went here for a nice birthday dinner. I thought it would have mire Japanese options on the menu being named soba. I ordered the black truffle-potato samosa which was not bad. I also had the chopped salad which I suprisingly really enjoyed despite it being iceburgh lettuce which is definitely not what I use for a good salad. I wish they didn't put fried batter all over it though. Last I had the vegetarian curry dish$LABEL$2
I had dinner and drinks with a group of 7 just before Thanksgiving.  Soba was one of the few places in the area that was able to accomodate a Friday night reservation for that many people in a short time$LABEL$3
Amazing food$LABEL$5
The crab meat corn-chowder appetizer is the finest appetizer I have ever had in my life. I have been to most of the great restaurants in New York City over the past 30 years$LABEL$5
I found the food here to be there. The atmosphere in Decor was spectacular however. I ordered the seared tuna and the sides were delicious$LABEL$4
My favorite place in Pittsburgh! The crispy  tofu there is so amazing! My next best dish is the thakkali curry.. The drinks specially the Asian plum sangria is fantastic.. Love the ambience! It's like a place in New York. Good veggie options.$LABEL$5
AMAZING! we had such a sublime experience here.  Service was wonderful$LABEL$5
My worst dining experience while working in Pittsburgh. Up until tonight I've thought \""these are the nicest people I've met\"" more than any other city I've worked in recently. Soba's staff has cured me of that. Food was good not great and my server acted as though my table of one was a bother even though I spent 60 bucks and ate within an hour with a 20% tip. My co workers were interested in checking this place out before we all head back to Los Angeles but I'll let them all know it's not worth a visit. Pittsburgh has some great restaurants but this is not one of them.$LABEL$3
We have been regulars at Soba for years$LABEL$1
Food ordered:Drinks - Rhubarb Fizz$LABEL$2
Just had dinner at Soba with the girlfriend and two friends.  It was a disappointment from top to bottom as we were excited for a very good asian infused dinner but instead experienced an average at best night out.  At first we were greeted instantly by our server and things started off fine.  However once we placed our drinks it took the staff$LABEL$3
Food was okay. Service okay. A bit expensive for the quality of food served. Thai corn soup jumbo crab??? Good lucking finding a piece of crab meat.  Pad Thai at a fusion place? Not good at all...Better go to a real thai restaurant for pad Thai. Tandoori Salmon was average. I still don't understand why they served their fancy cream soda warm.  A cup given with no ice and a bottle of soda?  Why weren't their any ice in the glass? Who drinks sodas at room temperature. This restaurant maybe was trying to be too fancy and forgot the basics of ICE.  Maybe it is really just me who prefer cold sodas. Overall it is okay$LABEL$2
I went to Pittsburgh for the first time to visit my friend and we were trying to choose a restaurant for dinner.  Like I do when I visit any new city$LABEL$3
I've had many great experience at Soba$LABEL$3
Definitely one of the better and more upscale modern Asian restaurants in Pittsburgh (excluding Thai food- so many good options). This was my first time at Soba after spending many visits at Umi. I would argue that Umi is the better sibling with excellent sushi options (with a hefty price tag) but Soba is a bit more approachable to the person who is less familiar with or doesn't want sushi. In all$LABEL$4
Amazing Two Fish Tempura Fat Roll...one of the best things I've tasted$LABEL$5
I love$LABEL$4
I did a walk in and was welcomed by a nice ambiance and very professional staff. They immediately took my coat and asked if I'd care for some tea or coffee. I waited ten minutes listening to some nice melodic music$LABEL$4
Johnnie knows exactly what to do with my hair$LABEL$5
Tasty & fresh sushi!  The food is very nicely prepared & laid out before you with a fair amount of simplicity$LABEL$4
Do not go here if you are on a budget and/or really hungry.  However$LABEL$3
This may be too harsh$LABEL$4
You get what you pay for. I've never been even slightly disappointed. I've been coming here with a good friend for a few years$LABEL$5
I believe I've found my new favorite restaurant. After being rather dissapointed with Chaya last night$LABEL$5
Great sushi for serious sushi eaters.  The omakase is expensive but definitely the way to go. Quite the adventure.  The sauces the chef puts on the sushi/sashimi is what makes the difference.The black cod dish is unbelievable.$LABEL$5
Anyone who says that there's no good sushi in Pittsburgh (and I've heard you say it$LABEL$5
I used to go to Chaya in Squirrel Hill at least once a week$LABEL$2
Ate here for the first time$LABEL$4
Went to Umi last night$LABEL$1
According to the Pittsburgh Magazine$LABEL$2
First off$LABEL$2
I'm going to start off by making the very bold statement that for most of last 10 years$LABEL$5
I had some pretty high expectations for Umi$LABEL$2
My friend and I went there last night and it was so good I can't stop thinking about it.  Even if I could stop thinking about that dinner$LABEL$4
There isn't a day that goes by that I think of what we could have done with that $400 we spent.  Went for my birthday$LABEL$3
Yummy Asian Fusion. Delicious Cocktails. Cool Ambiance.$LABEL$4
One of the best Sushi experience I had so far. I was on a short visit to Pittsburgh and looking for a good sushi joint for dinner$LABEL$4
Date & Time of Visit:  May 21$LABEL$1
My favorite sushi in the city of Pittsburgh. I gave 4 stars and not 5 due to cost $$$$! We try to eat here at least 3 to 4 times a year. The sushi is the freshest and most tasteful. I lived in Los Angeles for 8 years and was spoiled the sushi restaurants. I have introduced numerous friends to sushi at Umi that had never eaten Sushi before and now they love it. I have brought friends who thought their local place was good and I said that I am a sushi snob. Once they tried Umi they understood what I meant and how better their sushi was. Try the spaghetti squid  along with the miso crusted black cod.$LABEL$4
This used to be our favorite place when we first moved to Pittsburgh two years ago.  It had good quality fish and a nice atmosphere/cool staff.  As of our last visit$LABEL$1
Paid $1100 for the required course - party of 6 - and unfortunately did not come close to feeling satisfied in any regard - sorry guys - not a fan and way overpriced$LABEL$1
It is rather unfortunate that Pittsburgh doesn't have ANY privately owned strictly bagel joints. Bagels$LABEL$2
I am not sure what makes a perfect bagel but after eating at Bagel Factory I am pretty sure I am darn well close to it. Don't let the drab decor of the store fool you. Bagel Factory churns out delicious perfections of bakery like no one's business and we were told that the Penguins get their bagels from here too so we know we are in the right place. I've ordered the lox sandwich$LABEL$4
I do not see what all of the fuss is about - maybe it is due to the lack of authentic bagel options in the area? I agree that their bagels are authentic$LABEL$3
The food at this location was about the same as at the Squirrel Hill location on Forbes Avenue (not bad$LABEL$2
I was waiting for my laundry on Ellsworth last week$LABEL$1
Don't come here from NYC looking for a good bagel and lox$LABEL$2
A little overpriced but the bagels are always good and fresh. The cinnamon French toast (made from their cinnamon log bread) is also very good!$LABEL$4
Okay bagels though a little overpriced. Been to squirrel hill location and Ellsworth location once each. Have consistently had rude customer service. Really turns me off. Won't be going back even though the bagels are okay.$LABEL$2
This place runs very closely to par in regards to quality of food$LABEL$3
I'm not totally sure why I keep going back here. The place is tiny and dirty. It was super busy and only 2 employees were making food. The owner was on the register but kept leaving to do other things because they were so short-staffed. I felt bad for how overwhelmed the staff must have been$LABEL$2
Unfortunately$LABEL$2
Seriously the best bagel in Pittsburgh.  Which$LABEL$5
Don't frequent this business unless you want to be treated very badly. I was subjected to the rudest$LABEL$1
Beer selection is pretty decent. They have lots of \""Sex in the City\""-wannabe martinis to go w/ the \""Sex in the City\""-wannabe crowd. But don't expect to run into some skinny b!tch in Manolos. It's more in that \""That's SOOO my life\"" delusion way so common these days. Food is okay$LABEL$3
This is the bar that will not die$LABEL$3
Nice!  Spacious outdoor patio in the front$LABEL$4
I had heard of \""bacon night\"" from a friend and ended up going to the Harris Grille with some out of towners$LABEL$3
I went here last night with a couple of friends befor watchin' the black and gold complete the almost annual boring task of wooping' on some brownie as* in Cleveland.  We were seated upstairs at a great table upstairs facing ellseworth.  The view was great watching many of my fellow burghers' imbibe on a windy Sunday afternoon.  The positive experience ended here.  Well$LABEL$2
I like this place$LABEL$3
I go to Harris most every week for happy hour$LABEL$3
Harris has a nice patio and a decent bar$LABEL$2
Harris Grill was long one of my favorite spots to goto just about any night of the week.  However it's changed in recent months and I don't think I will return.On a recent Thursday night$LABEL$1
A quick bar update: when I was here over the weekend$LABEL$4
I've been to Harris Grill many times. My favorite thing is their happy hour -- half off all drafts$LABEL$3
I frequent Harris Grill quite often. Whenever we need a place in walking distance I always pick them over all the other high priced or mediocre Shadyside restaurant/bars. Their menu changes seasonally and is always hilarious (more so than Mad Mex$LABEL$4
Harris grill is lively$LABEL$4
One of the best casual restaurants in Shadyside$LABEL$4
only a stupid$LABEL$2
I wish i could rate it 3.5... There are certain foods that are mediocre$LABEL$3
Your lips are attempting to distract me from the heinous crime you're committing. That's what I said to the urinal in the Men's room at the Harris Grill. The urinal that is a bright-red lipped mouth is a fine idea; however$LABEL$3
Good Belgium beer selection!!Small patio even smaller bar.  Appears to always be very crowded regardless of time of day.  This place has a lot of neighborhood dive bar charm complete with tatt'ed hipsters both server and served.There is one dude with dreadlocks to his knees.  The locals observation of this guy is he is usually in a bad mood and rude.  I didn't interact with him so I cannot comment.  However$LABEL$3
My go to spot when I just want to relax with some friends.  Great drinks and craft beer selection is coupled with very good food.  Make sure to checkout the lounge upstairs during those cold winter months.  During the summer grab a seat on either the front patio for people watching$LABEL$5
Food: the food at Harris grill is the epitome of average$LABEL$2
This place just bored me.Really don't know what to say.Bored$LABEL$2
It's a good thing Harris Grill has good beer and Bacon Night since otherwise you wouldn't have anything to occupy you for the 45 minutes to an hour it takes to get food on your table from the point in time that you order.  FYI - definitely order that last round of drinks (plus an additional one) as you ask for your bill since the poor service doesn't stop when the food actually gets to your table.  I wrote HG off the first time I went there$LABEL$2
Atmosphere - downstairs was nice and cozy with the fireplace roaring. Upstairs was a bit chilly and we were seated in front of a huge window overlooking Ellsworth Ave which was nice$LABEL$3
I went here last night with my \""man-friend\"" around 9:00ish to get some grub.  We were starving so we were a bit disappointed that it was a 30-45 minute wait but it was a friday night.  We perused the drink list (it is a bit confusing because it looks like a facebook page) but settled on a MOFOjito and a margarita.  The MOFOjito (mojito with pomegranate) and the marg were served in pint glasses which was a surprise but so was the $20 tab for both of them. My \""man-friend\"" was appalled (he is normally an IC Light kinda guy).After we waited by the very dimly lit bar for about 45 minutes the hostess sat us at a table in the downstairs portion of the restaurant (basically right next to where we were standing.) I started off with the veggie chili which was hearty and filling. It was topped with sour cream and served with a pita chip...delish.  I also ordered a spinach salad which the server explained to me is now different from what's on the menu.  Something about no strawberries$LABEL$3
Harris Grill and I spent an amazing Saturday morning together a few months ago when I was suffering from a near-death hangover. It brought me back to life with two stellar Bloody Marys (they were half-price!)$LABEL$3
Don't understand the hype$LABEL$3
Appearance is bestThe drinks and food don't live upTo expectations.(b)$LABEL$2
I ate at the Harris Grill for the first time last night$LABEL$5
2 words: TATER TOTS! tater tots give me such a nostalgic feeling thinking back to my elementary$LABEL$4
Visited this place three times. I never used to go because it was across the street from the original Elbow Room but three times this summer. I've usually stuck to the Baby Burgher Platter. Burgers are really tasty and just hit the spot. It's not like having a huge burger$LABEL$4
Mmm not too happy with my recent experience at Harris grill. I visit Ellsworth ave plenty and I have been to Harris grill on numerous occasions. After working all day$LABEL$2
I don't really have a good review for this place. It's not that the place isn't good it's just that I don't have an accurate experience to recount.I went for bacon night. This is on Tuesdays.I saw an outside patio on my way in. On a nice day$LABEL$2
5-star drinks$LABEL$3
Meh.  The Harris Grill is one more American business in a long line to have great ideas ruined by terrible execution.  An entire page of delicious looking burgers?  Bland and overcooked.  Cool looking spaces?  Can get cramped and awkward with groups$LABEL$2
Overcharged $19 and having a food order messed up twice$LABEL$1
This place has changed.  Just a couple of years ago$LABEL$2
Yummy$LABEL$4
This little bar and grill makes me want to move to Pittsburgh so bad!  I've been here twice.  Once in 2009 and again in 2011 and the food and booze always makes me happy! Both of my visits were for the Pittsburgh Bacon Bash and of course I ate tons of bacon things$LABEL$4
Great drinks (frozen cosmos!!) but the food and service leaves something to be desired. Try the Sunday brunch!$LABEL$3
A pleasant enough little place for \""Hipster Yinzers\"" to engage in those unique conversations where everyone talks simultaneously and loudly and no one is heard. The fare is somewhat overpriced for minuscule drinks$LABEL$2
I had the tomato soup (around $3.50) and a side order of macaroni and cheese (around $4.50). The tomato soup is very peppery$LABEL$3
I have nothing good to say about this place. I've been here on several occasions over the years and here's what I have observed:1- If the place is crowded (which it almost always is) expect terrible service from your waiter/bartender. Waitstaff has a pretty poor knowledge of their own drink menu.2- The food will be overpriced/sub par. On one occasion me and my entire party got food poisoning from their fried calamari3- You will be seated somewhere awkward/uncomfortable. The interior is cool looking but not functional$LABEL$1
This place offers really poor service. The waitstaff go out of their way to not help you. This has happened to many people I know multiple times. We put up with it so we could get the brunch. We stopped going after we got some serious attitude from our waiter. He was flat out rude and upset my friend so we left and won't be coming back. The food isn't that great (the tacos/fajitas are terrible and flavorless$LABEL$2
Light your torches and get the pitchforks$LABEL$2
We went here tonight for the first time since I was craving a burger and we've been meaning to check this place out. It has a cozy atmosphere: dark$LABEL$4
I am giving Harris 4 stars because it is my neighborhood bar and has sentimental value to me. Minus that$LABEL$4
This is a place where I've never even had a just-OK experience. Every time I come in$LABEL$5
I've visited Harris's Grill a few times over the past 3 - 4 years and every time I leave I ask myself \""Why do people love this  place so much!?\"" The food is not incredible and the service is always mediocre at best. Minus the bacon gimmicks and pretentious Shadyside vibe... This place is an average bar/restaurant.$LABEL$2
My husband and I tried Harris Grill for the first time on a Sunday night. We moved to the area in August and are moving away in June$LABEL$2
Zero stars for service.  Zero stars for price. One star for food. I have been to the Harris Grill three separate times for dining.  The first was happy hour - with a party of six. We waited 30 minutes for a table; we watched several tables empty out and stay un-bussed and dirty for more than 10minutes at a time.  Obviously they must have been understaffed.  Once seated$LABEL$1
Came here with a party of 5 others for brunch at 11am on a Sunday. We were seated immediately but were surprised to learn that there is no brunch buffet during the winter.My eggs benedict was good$LABEL$2
The food here is good. Nothing too interesting on the menu though. Reasonably priced$LABEL$3
The place is good for drinking but definitely not to have a meal. There're not much options on the menu. I tried the pasta once and it was tasteless.$LABEL$2
Let me tell you about my experience at the Harris Grill$LABEL$1
My previous reviews were all 5 stars but my last few times at the Harris have just been so 'meh' that I'm taking it down to 3 stars.The Harris is my favorite bar in Pittsburgh and they have fantastic bartenders...Byron$LABEL$3
I was in town for a job interview (in Moon Township) and decided to venture into the city the evening before.  Here's the run-down based on this one visit:Food:  I was half (or more) starved by the time I got there.  I ordered the veggie chili and it was quite tasty and the Philly Cheesesteak.  The cheesesteak was \""hearty\"" and quite generous but given the size (and calories) I doubt I'd order it again.  I ended up taking it back to the hotel (for what I thought would have been a midnight snack but did not happen).  If I happened to be in the area and in the mood for a cheesesteak$LABEL$3
The vibe here is great. The servers et cetera have great energy and are the kind of people I'd like to invite to sit down and share dinner with them. I have only been there twice. I had the Henny Penny twice and it was a very different sandwich on each visit. The first time it was over-spiced. It was dry and I'd swear it had no cheese. The second time$LABEL$3
Went for the first time today. Kitchen was just wrapping up a re-model$LABEL$4
Fantastically Happy place to eat!The building looks like the remains of an old house.  The walk to the hostess is a bit awkward as you're walking through the front patio full of guests already enjoying their meal.  That not really being an issue$LABEL$5
I normally avoid brunch buffets as a rule; the food is never up to par and it's a cattle call. Usually a poor excuse for restaurants to make money. However$LABEL$5
I don't understand why this place is so popular.  I've been there 4 times and each time the food was pretty gross.  Most recently$LABEL$2
My friend suggested meeting up here for Friday happy hour. Though I trust her recommendations$LABEL$4
I'm a longtime fan of the Harris Grill so please note that my review is specific to brunch only.  My friends and I were lucky enough to get patio seating on a beautiful Sunday afternoon. That was the highlight of brunch- friends and the patio. The only option for brunch is to get the buffet. They were packed and couldn't keep enough food out.  The Mac and Cheese$LABEL$2
I wish I could give this 4 stars as Harris Grill is one of my favorite spots in Pittsburgh but the past two times I have been for brunch it has been less than par.  Many things went wrong during my most recent brunch experience which include them running out of plates for the buffet and not being able to replenish the food fast enough.  Once you waited for the food to be replenished (about 10-15 minutes) it was just average. The buffet had an omelet station$LABEL$3
I can't properly review the food or beverage selections since I never actually got seated.  I came as part of a large group$LABEL$2
I have so many fond memories of coming here in the summertime with my sisters or friends to relax and unwind after a long day with a few frozen cosmos. For $3 at happy hour$LABEL$4
Harris Grill is excellent if the weather is nice and there's a table on the patio.  The atmosphere inside is super bro-y.  Bring a group if you're going inside.Their food is decent for a bar--I wouldn't go there for dinner$LABEL$3
A last minute cancellation afforded me the rare opportunity to have a weeknight dinner at a 'normal' person's time$LABEL$4
Harris is the best.  Good beer$LABEL$5
If you have a sense of humor$LABEL$4
This is a great place to go to during the summer time. I love sitting out on the patio. I got the chicken sandwich and my friend got the Pittsburgh salad. I would totally recommend getting any of the salads. The steak salad looked amazing (the people next to us got it) and the Pittsburgh salad tasted delicious. My sandwich was fine$LABEL$4
My favorite drink on the menu is the vanilla white Russian.  Get it$LABEL$3
Harris Grill is 100% OK. The service is nice$LABEL$3
The frozen cosmos and mimosas are great$LABEL$4
I've been to Harris several times before but always seem to forget to Yelp afterwards. However$LABEL$4
A unique little spot with a quirky menu. I usually frequent this place with friends or with my lifelong dining partner due to the fact that it's close to my workplace as well as my abode. I really go here just for the atmosphere at night. When I'm feeling lively$LABEL$3
Great evening. Basics:Great service$LABEL$4
Sooo...I ended up here last Fri. night at around 10:30 after a total customer service fail at another bar downtown that shall remain unnamed (see my bad customer service list if you must know...)  My friend and I had just finished crawling the art galleries downtown$LABEL$3
Great brunch deal! There will be a line if you arrive later than 11 am on Sunday because a 15-bucks buffet that has tons of wonderful food and one free coffee or juice or Bloody Mary just sounds so damn good! I love their waffles and egg Benny!$LABEL$4
I started coming here for work lunch meetings years ago$LABEL$4
I stay 2 blocks away from Harris Grill. I have been to shiloh's grill as well$LABEL$2
I have been here many many times and overall my experience is very good.  They have a good selection of drinks and decent food.  They mac-n-cheese dishes are delicious and so are their burgers (my favorite used to be their sliders but unfortunately they removed them from their recent menu). The ambiance is also great for both winter and summer (they have outdoor patios)$LABEL$4
PSA: there is a groupon for this place that is valid until May 2015!Burger was good. Mac and cheese was a little salty and not very warm but it wasn't terrible. Cookies and cream dessert was super yummy. Service was very attentive and we went on a Saturday night. Kinda dim and loud in there...it is a bar after all$LABEL$4
I like this store$LABEL$4
One of my favorite things to do is consignment shop. On a dreary day I decided to look up a few local shops to hit up and my finale trip was to Hey Betty's.Hey Betty's seemed to be very organized. It was a small area$LABEL$2
I grew up in Pittsburgh and now live in San Jose$LABEL$5
I've been a member of X Shadyside for almost 2 months now. It's a bit more expensive than I wanted to pay for a gym$LABEL$4
I've had a big change of opinion after spending more time in that gym. The equipment would often break down and never get fixed. Considering how small the gym is$LABEL$1
This is a great gym! It is pricey - consider the area$LABEL$3
X Shadyside is a no frills type of gym (no pool$LABEL$3
I have been a member for a year. Pretty crowded$LABEL$2
I LOVE THIS PLACE.  It is less expensive than area hotels:  for less than the price of one normal hotel room at a hotel located in a less desirable area$LABEL$5
Do you remember the crappy apartment you rented in college or grad school?  The one with the bad a/c and dirty carpet?  The one with the barely functioning electrical outlets and tiny$LABEL$1
Great location but low on amenities.  HVAC system is ancient and the noise factor on Fifth Avenue is problematic. The price is nice but that's all I can say about the positive.$LABEL$2
Our two-night stay at the Shadyside Inn involved three suites and was like a god damn roller coaster ride.First of all$LABEL$2
It's with some regret that I rank the Shadyside Inn Suites so low. We were there for just one night$LABEL$2
If you are like me$LABEL$3
Oh Shadyside Inn and suites I wanted to love you I really did$LABEL$2
I was in town for several days for work.  I had a trade show to attend in Monroeville$LABEL$4
Overall a decent yet confusing experience...Pros: it's like living in an apt. because it's spacious and has a kitchen and laundry room downstairs. There's even free laundry soap available in the laundry room. It's located next to a lot of restaurants and shops. Some of the staff has been friendly in providing things$LABEL$2
I'm granting one star because there's no way to give none.As I write this$LABEL$1
We stayed at the Shadyside Inn for months and spent thousands of dollars. I really wanted to write a good review$LABEL$1
Nothing special about this place. Great location but the facilities are a little tired.$LABEL$2
This place is awesome. Immaculately clean$LABEL$5
We stopped here for a bite to eat before going out drinking.  The food was good (I had the fish sandwich$LABEL$3
I have lived in pittsburgh for almost a decade and have never been to this restaurant until now.  Many people could not believe it.  But honestly$LABEL$3
Came here for dinner on my birthday (back before I turned 21) and also when my parents were in town for dinner.  The food was decent each time$LABEL$4
I've been here twice and I'm just not crazy about it.  Nothing is BAD$LABEL$2
Been there twice in the last year.  The service was mediocre once$LABEL$2
Extensive wine menu and average service.  They have an in-house wine specialist that helps you with your wine selection - impressive. The food is the high point of this place. They always seem to have a great selection of seasonal foods - gnoochi stuffed with sweet potatoes and topped with goat cheese and cranberries. When warm weather gets here$LABEL$4
I met a group of girls here for dinner last night$LABEL$2
I had gone to the Elbow Room at the previous location and was not a fan. But since the new location is walking distance for me$LABEL$3
Well$LABEL$2
We came in here for after dinner drinks and although the ambiance was very focused on the basketball game going on$LABEL$3
use to be a max and erma's and if that bar wasn't low enough it now misses the mark$LABEL$2
I was promised a room full of elbows$LABEL$2
I had a Sunday lunch here... well... I wanted to... but all they had was brunch menu. Salad was on it and I had it so I will count that as a lunch.I had a grilled chicken salad. It was good except that the chicken was burned. I wanted to substitute shrimp for chicken but the kitchen wasn't ready for that. My friend had steak & egg and requested the meat to be medium and it was burned.The best think was that they poured the wine on my glass. The huge huge glass was half full. I super loved it! because I drink and dring a lot and don't get drunk. It was a busy morning/lunch time for them but our waiteress was attentive$LABEL$3
I'm not legal to drink but each time I've been here the food has been normal--make sure you check out their dessert menu though--it's divine. The atmosphere of the restaurant is really nice and romantic with dim lighting and a lot of  pretty lights.  Service is a bit slow$LABEL$3
I have dined at the elbow room twice now. First time I ordered a grilled cheese sandwich$LABEL$2
Overall$LABEL$3
I had brunch here with two of my friends$LABEL$2
Tucked away on the 2nd floor of Walnut St. - the boutique corridor of Shadyside$LABEL$4
The old Elbow Room on Ellsworth in Shadyside - with its crayons-and-butcher-paper$LABEL$4
Everything about our experience was wonderful!!  We had made a reservation because we had a large party - our table was ready and waiting for us (this was a Friday night about 6:30). Our waitress was friendly and kept up with our many requests - from drinks to appetizers to dinner.  The food all came out together - (we had salads$LABEL$5
I have been here once for drinks and once for lunch. A really great place to go if your parents are visiting (it's a bar sans the rowdy crowd).  We ordered some soup$LABEL$3
\""Bland\"" is probably the key word in describing this place. A local Applebees-type feel.I was here for dinner one night$LABEL$2
I fully agree with reviewers who call the food bland$LABEL$2
Drinks are good but food sucks. I tried the food multiple times and I think only the french onion soup and salads are descent. The main courses are very low quality.$LABEL$2
Wonderful brunch. The food and service was great. The waiters were very friendly and the food wasn't too pricey. Really a great option for brunch.$LABEL$4
Since my return to Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
Desert was great - beer was good.  Food was under seasoned a bit with out the sauce.  Husband liked it with.$LABEL$3
As we strolled up Walnut Street this morning we were greeted by a large sandwich board sign advertising brunch.  Spirits lifted we raced inside for the sidewalk advertised  breakfast glories...sat down...and were told brunch was only on Sundays. My lil heart fell. Regroup. I ordered the half sandwich and chili and my partner in this mess ordered a chop salad.  The chili should be renamed Alpo & Cheddar. The salads are better at Get Go.And direct quote upon our server checking on us..drumroll....\""From what I see I presume you are okay\"" and a quick exit stage left.We shall not be returning. Even as tempting as the $10 sangria made of pure canned fruit juice appears.$LABEL$2
It's a nice enough place with a decent selection of drinks (and a not-bad post-9pm happy hour)$LABEL$2
Came upon this restaurant when I was at the Apple store. It was a Tuesday night and the place was not that crowded. I ordered the salmon and overall it was good. The gnocchi that came with it was yummy. The bartender was very nice and friendly. The guy who owns the restaurant his dad and buddy were also at the bar and they were a fun bunch at the bar. Would defiantly come back especially for drinks. Great bar place to hang out at.$LABEL$4
Place was interesting. The decor reminds you of \""cheers\"" because of the wood. I had a salmon wrap and it was very good. It had a mustard sauce and came with fries. Prices were decent. Our waitress lacked personality and her breath smelled bad$LABEL$2
I like elbow room for how quiet it usually is. For being on walnut (if you prefer the loudness of steel cactus and marios then you won't like this place too much)$LABEL$4
I don't know how this place has stayed in business for so long.  It has never appealed to me$LABEL$2
Bad$LABEL$1
This place is definitely great. Any entree I have had has been excellent.. The service is great too. Bartender is very friendly and the atmosphere is very nice ! I'm going to be a regular for sure!$LABEL$5
It started out as a place where I would occasionally come for a few drinks.  They were good.  White sangria topped with champagne and the vodka-infused fruit.  Then$LABEL$5
Always enjoy coming to The Elbow Room. Atmosphere is great. Food is great. Jason was our server. He did an excellent job! Highly recommend asking for Jason.$LABEL$5
My friends and I found ourselves here because of the crowds for the Jam of Walnut Street. We went there on a recommendation from friends for their happy hour martinis. From 9-11PM$LABEL$4
The Elbow Room exceeded my expectations.  The Novemburger was creative and flavor full.  Lunch time on a Saturday seemed quiet though$LABEL$3
When we came to dine here$LABEL$4
I ordered the prosciutto with asparagus as my appetizer. I really enjoyed its flavor alone$LABEL$3
This place is hit or miss. It'll depends on who is in the kitchen$LABEL$2
This place is pretty small.  I wouldn't expect to go in there and try on something in front of a mirror so that the tailor can check it out.  This is the kind of place you go only for dry-cleaning items$LABEL$3
Took my boyfriends suit to get dry cleaned$LABEL$2
I've been using this store for about a year now. Recently I took a very dirty cashmere sweater of my husband's$LABEL$5
I have not extensively used dry cleaning services in other locations but last year I started using this one. They are very professional$LABEL$4
I'd heard great things about one of the stylists$LABEL$1
I've since had two more haircuts from Richard. The second haircut was great$LABEL$2
I've been seeing Richard at Dean of Shadyside for 2.5 years.  There have been some awesome haircuts along the way$LABEL$4
I went into Dean of Shadyside salon to get my hair colored. My stylist was nice and friendly however that was not the problem that I encountered at this salon. My stylist rushed through the process of coloring my hair as she had another client during the same time as my appointment. In addition$LABEL$1
Welcome to the Richard show!!! He is pompous. He is talented. He is pricey. And he might just make YOU look like a million bucks!I have been to Richard at Dean of Shadyside twice for cuts.  I am the sort who sits down and says$LABEL$3
If you are into crooked haircuts and terrible customer service$LABEL$1
Terrible! I purchased a groupon$LABEL$1
I've been going to Deans for a couple years now and have tried a variety of their services they offer like  waxing$LABEL$3
Just moved to Pittsburgh a week ago and I needed a place to get a few platinum pieces weaved into my more honey-blondish locks.  I know a fair amount about hair$LABEL$2
This is where I always get my haircut and color by Richard$LABEL$5
Let me start by saying I was given a coupon for a free haircut and mani.  You have to really let me down with free to get a two-star review.THE HAIRCUT. Let's put it this way--after I went home and re-washed and re-styled it$LABEL$2
The first time I went to Dean$LABEL$1
I've tried to like Dean's several times over the years.  Because if you go there and then don't come back for 9 months they offer you a free haircut.  No joke.  And each time I've gone$LABEL$2
Krista is a hair wizard. Not only do I love the cut and colour of my hair I love how well informed she keeps me about everything she's doing to my hair. Her product knowledge is out of this world and she seems to really love making people look good. I would never trust anyone else with my hair.$LABEL$5
Pros: convenient location in Shadyside$LABEL$2
First of all the website$LABEL$1
Food is mediocre but the wing specials and flavors are decent.The beer specials are pretty good.  It has a dive bar feel despite being in the heart of Shadyside$LABEL$3
The William Penn Tavern is just a good place to have a cheap$LABEL$3
Great food and normally great atmosphere$LABEL$2
Weirdest nights ever.Wormhole tequila black-out.Too crowded/hot/cold.(b)$LABEL$2
The waitress told us we had to leave our table right after we paid our bill (and tipped her generously) just because we hadn't ordered another drink. I have never been treated so rudely by a waitstaff before in my life.$LABEL$1
Probably the worst bar in Shadyside to go on Friday/Saturday nights. Waaay too crowded and loud. The clientele sucks - it's people in their mid to late-20's desperately trying to cling onto their college years by being loud and obnoxious. It does have a nice back patio that is heated during the winter and smoking is permitted$LABEL$2
Review base on wings n beer! Been here a couple of times now. I always seem to come when they have wings on special. Which works out great for me because I love wings$LABEL$4
Haven't tried the wings yet$LABEL$3
Great beer and food specials.  They had the Michigan game on too!$LABEL$3
It's a sports bar... I've heard the wings were good$LABEL$2
If you're drunk get the kitchen sink wings and mac & cheese bites! Their fried zucchini is pretty good too :)$LABEL$4
Do you like sports$LABEL$3
A typical sports bar in Shadyside. I've only been here once a couple years ago$LABEL$3
What a great neighbourhood joint!  I can't speak to the food as we stopped there after dinner - but parked ourselves at the bar to watch a baseball game and have a few drinks. We were visiting Pittsburgh from California$LABEL$5
I use to pass by this place all the time. It always seemed dark and dingy from the outside. I still haven't been for the nightlife$LABEL$2
Good little place to hang out$LABEL$3
This is a neighborhood Denny's with a bar. Small place and the meal was served on plastic plates and they used plastic mugs for coffee. At best$LABEL$2
A place to go when you want to have a nice lunch and catch up with friends.Atmosphere:Cappy's is located on Walnut St. in Squirrell Hill.  Although I've definitely experience better dining atmospheres$LABEL$3
To me$LABEL$3
Best bar on Walnut.Go here anytime of day$LABEL$4
Can't comment on food since I was just in for beers.  Okay crowd$LABEL$2
Crappy's is more like it... sorry I could NOT resist!This place is very below average.  The bar is small$LABEL$1
Cappy's provides a welcome relief from the high prices on Shadyside's posh Walnut Street shopping and dining district.  The food isn't great$LABEL$3
I was surprised how good the food was. Great service very friendly people.$LABEL$4
I was here today for lunch. Our waitress was brand new and so we had to be a little patient$LABEL$3
Avg food$LABEL$2
I cameHere for breakfast so When you first walk in I asked myself am I in the right place$LABEL$2
In my opinion$LABEL$2
Food is.decent. karoake is the best I've gone to in a long time. The place is super small.though. that is the biggest disadvantage and why I give it 3 stars. You are practically sitting on top of people.$LABEL$3
Came to check out karaoke night. It was really packed$LABEL$3
I've been eating here on and off for the better part of two decades. There's nothing really special about the food$LABEL$3
I must be jaded since I came from Boston where the Bakeries are excellent.  I heard through the grape vine that the roasted almond torte was excellent so we bought some and brought it home.  The salty sweet toasted almond coating was excellent$LABEL$3
I really like the signature toasted almond cake$LABEL$3
Yum! I just picked up a cookie platter ($32...see photo) for a party and it looks awesome. Can't wait to have my guests drool over the buttery goodness that are Prantls' cookies. Other than the treats$LABEL$4
Come here for the jelly sandwich cookies. BEST jelly sandwich cookies ever. they're round$LABEL$5
I came in here looking for an Italian loaf to serve with dinner at around 2 PM and was rudely informed by the girl at the counter that they were sold out of pretty much anything of the sort.Disappointed$LABEL$4
Pastries$LABEL$5
Place is alright$LABEL$3
In sum$LABEL$4
Wow! Their burnt almond torte is a Pittsburgh staple$LABEL$4
This place is the BOMB DOT COM.{does anyone still say that? I'm 30 and so out of touch with reality}But I do know dessert and it's official. This place has the very best burnt almond torte ever. If you're reading this and thinking that sounds gross$LABEL$5
I generally am not a fan of baked goods. HOWEVER$LABEL$5
Meh is right. My whole family is in love with Prantl's enough so that they convinced me to get my birthday cupcakes from there... First of all. They don't have cupcakes they have these little mini cakes that cost an arm and a leg$LABEL$2
Too sweet. Tried the famous almond cake and some cupcakes. Cannot even finish eating them. Plus$LABEL$3
I don't even like cake$LABEL$5
Nothing stood out$LABEL$2
too sweet for me$LABEL$3
I can only speak to the burnt almond torte from Shadyside.  After all$LABEL$5
Nope. Sorry$LABEL$2
The cinnamon rolls are so good. They are almost half cream cheese icing which is delicious. Plan to be in a sugar coma afterward but its so worth it! The red velvet looked good but I felt too guilty to order more after ordering all five of the cinnamon rolls they had left :)$LABEL$5
If you want to get pastries while being yelled at by the staff and treated like dirt$LABEL$1
Like many others$LABEL$2
While I still like the almond torte$LABEL$2
After falling in love with the burnt almond torte while living in PGH$LABEL$5
I really wanted to like this bakery! I came in with high expectations$LABEL$2
Amazing pastries! Gotta go and check it out.  We had the almond tort$LABEL$5
Oh$LABEL$5
MY OH MY can prantl's make a Cali girl feel like she's in heaven!Came here today for the famous almond torte and left with an almond torte$LABEL$5
Best desserts I've ever eaten. While I am a chocolate girl normally$LABEL$5
A Pittsburgh gem.  I adore Prantl's Bakery. It is a must visit if you have friends or family in town. They have a tasty selection of pastries$LABEL$5
Best doughnuts in Pittsburgh. I generally pass on other baked goods. Mediocre bread.Generally unfriendly staff$LABEL$4
Pros: Friendly service$LABEL$3
Jitters definitely has good coffee and ice cream$LABEL$3
I see people sitting in Jitters' chairs outside all the time and I like the decor so I really$LABEL$1
My favorite coffee shop on Walnut St.  Most of the folks in there are regulars who greet each ohter by name.  I did my job search there this winter so I was in daily and I too$LABEL$5
This is by far my favorite place to get coffee ever. If you are a student$LABEL$5
With Coffee Tree Roasters and Starbucks packed to the brim$LABEL$4
Sorry folks$LABEL$3
This place went from awesome to worst after it changed owners. It used to be simple to buy coffee. They used to have a white mocha but not anymore. I miss the old owner of the place. But still support small caf\u00e9s!!!$LABEL$1
Their coffee is solid--better than coffee tree roasters$LABEL$5
A decent place to hang out on weekend mornings. Decent coffee$LABEL$3
Let it be known that I am the biggest Bruegger's fan ever.  I've been a pretty steady once-a-weeker since childhood.After all that...This is the worst Bruegger's ever.  I always think: Oh$LABEL$3
Haven't been to a Brueggers in years.  This one has a great location and is probably one of the only fast service style restaurants in Walnut Street area.  While I was here I just had a simple everything bagel toasted w/cream cheese.  It hit the spot.  Still as good as I remember them.$LABEL$3
The staff is very friendly at this location. I love the create your own salad option$LABEL$4
Pamela is a bad representation of this location! Attitude and lack of hygiene is an issue for this \""employee.\"" I will not return.$LABEL$1
This is a wonderful place. When you enter$LABEL$4
Stop in here for all of your overpriced candles$LABEL$3
Despite the kooky spelling$LABEL$5
Such a great store. They stock everything (EVERYTHING)$LABEL$5
If you are looking for an outstanding comedy gift$LABEL$4
They have a huge selection of greeting cards in the back$LABEL$5
This is where I go when I can't think of a gift for someone. The store isn't particularly large$LABEL$4
Large selection of unique/cute-tastic gifts.  Humerous knick-knacks/books galore.  Very adorable and staff was very pleasant.  Looking forward to going back again.$LABEL$4
The store is really fun$LABEL$4
This is a gem in Shadyside. I make sure to stop in here every time I'm in Shadyside. It's a perfect little novelty store equipped with funny quirky cards$LABEL$5
Without a doubt one of the nicest places I have ever had the pleasure of laying my head......having wine and cheese.......or breakfasting.The Inn on Negley is gorgeously appointed.  The individual rooms$LABEL$5
Went to a High Tea here on Sunday.  Although the setting was lovely and the staff was welcoming$LABEL$1
I was the lucky birthday girl at a surprise High Tea party for eight at The Inn on Negley.  The service is as good as it gets.  We placed our first tea order (you can change it up however many times you like!) then the chef came out to explain the food she had made.  For our first tier we had chicken salad sandwich$LABEL$4
Amazing!I recently hosted my friend's bridal shower here and everything was absolutely perfect!  Heidi went above and beyond helping me plan from 3 hours away$LABEL$5
What a wonderful location!  My sister's future MIL hosted her bridal shower here and with 11 people$LABEL$5
First time having Afternoon tea time in the States. This place is very beautifully decorated. We had the Earl Grey and peach ginger tea. They were really good and the tea stand was AMAZING$LABEL$5
Tokyo Japanese Food Store is the only Japanese grocery in the area with a nice selection of produce$LABEL$2
I love this little grocer. They prepare little bentos (perfect for lunch while you do your laundry) and have a ton of niche items you can't get anywhere else. Plus$LABEL$5
The bento lunches made by the owners at Tokyo Japanese Food Store are the bomb!! They satisfy any Japanese food craving that I might have. They typically either have something fried or grilled along with a small salad$LABEL$5
\""Sugoi! Suki! Hontou!\"" (Wow! Love it! Really!)Just a few of the cute little responses the cashier exclaimed as she rang my items up (I'd like to thank anime for my informal understanding of the Japanese language). Tokyo Japanese is one of the most comprehensive Japanese groceries I've been to. Sure there are other Asian groceries where you'll find common items like soy sauce and pocky sticks$LABEL$5
It should be a 3.5. The bento box is tasty and they offered 10% off until the end of the year. But we were there around 2:00 pm. There were not a lot of selections for bento boxes. Maybe we should go earlier next time.$LABEL$3
I was looking for something Japanese around me but had no luck until I came across this place$LABEL$5
This Japanese food store has a nice selection of East Asian goods which are tougher to find in the East End. For example$LABEL$3
I have been here a few times and always find something new to try. The staff are a delight and I have great back and forth banter with the elder gentleman who is usually at the counter. My latest visit here was to get supplies for a friends Hot Pot night. Both of the staff were incredibly helpful with my questions. They directed me towards the best cuts of meat (I knew thin cut beef and pork worked well but not the specific type - i.e. fatty or lean). There was a great selection and variety of fresh vegetables which were well priced. Self control with respect to the assortment of red bean paste-based sweets was difficult but I managed!$LABEL$5
Great place to go. Friday and Saturdays are busy. Good prices for shady side.$LABEL$5
This bar smells like a smoky urinal cake$LABEL$2
I am in the service industry and my friends and I came here for my birthday. It was the worst experience and the bartender wouldn't give us lemons or limes for our drinks. She was rude and all over the place. We would have spent a lot of money but she deterred us from that.$LABEL$1
So I stumbled into this Giant Eagle Market District on my way home from Trader Joe's.  (Note: The only grumble I have with TJ is lack of everyday essentials and I was suprised to learn that TJ doesn't stock dry beans).  So I am headstrong about making lentil soup that day and instead of going to Whole Foods (see past review).I have been to the South Hills GE Market District before.  I actually enjoy the experience of walking around HUGE stores that overwhelm me with variety and random things.  Thus is the experience of GE Market District.  You are in a full-service grocery store that caters to all income levels.  AND you get FUEL POINTS for wasabi-covered soy beans.  Fantastic!  They give you a map of the store$LABEL$4
The nicest full-range grocery I've ever seen.  With$LABEL$2
This is my #1 grocery store$LABEL$4
one of these things is not like the others$LABEL$4
What's with the bitter reviews? I live in San Francisco$LABEL$5
The parking lot is a clusterfuck.The entrance to this location always smells like spoiled milk. They usually have everything except what I am looking for and/or I just can't find it because it is not placed with similar things. Like when I went looking for organic hot cocoa mix...a week later I found it$LABEL$1
The last time i was in Pgh Giant Eagle Market District  was known as the  Food Gallery.. Giant eagle market district is located at the corner of Negley and Centre ave. The outside parking lot is usually full. However you'll be able to find  additional parking in the garage located on the Claybourne side of the store.  I was pleased with the store from an aesthetic stand point. The market district is  a step above the non market district Giant Eagles. This location offers a larger selection of  ethnic$LABEL$3
If they actually actually kept the store stocked$LABEL$2
Selection of specialty and regular items is quite good. BUT$LABEL$2
Ugh! Today is dark$LABEL$2
Wow$LABEL$3
ETA 2/23/12: Rather than shop here once a week for $25 (down from my 100-200 bill 5 years ago) I now shop exclusively Whole Foods$LABEL$1
Store has a lot to choose from$LABEL$1
I guess you pay for what you get...and in this case you get \""The Market District\"" marque.  I don't have much time to write a full review so I'll just post one experience:  I went to this store to purchased smoked turkey necks and/or wings to make soup.  the small package was 11.00 dollars.  I don't remember the poundage$LABEL$2
Given the other expensive or underwhelming grocery stores in the city$LABEL$4
Always busy!  Selection of veggies are ok.  Selection of fruit is a little below average.  Otherwise it has everything you'd expect from a chain grocery store.Main complaint with this location is that the organization of aisles and products are not logical.  You often see items in multiple locations because the layout of the store was clearly not thought out.$LABEL$2
This used to be my \""go to\"" place for groceries.  However$LABEL$2
Some people go crazy over this location$LABEL$2
They have a diverse variety of ethnic foods and is at a convenient location near UPMC Shadyside$LABEL$3
This is a customer service based review$LABEL$1
I want to like this location for a number of reasons: they have a chef on site doing cooking demonstrations and handing out samples. The staff is really nice when it's crowded. They're a Market District location$LABEL$2
The GE is overly-large and over-priced. Yes$LABEL$2
My local grocery store.They just remodeled the cafe and dining area- looks beautiful and is spacious. They sell beer now. Also has a deli and cheese section. Gets crowded in the afternoons.$LABEL$5
The produce here is always beaten to a pulp and expensive. We only get it here for convenience. The romaine is especially pitiful. We complained (finally) and received an apology and an offer for free cotton candy flavored grapes. We never did redeem our grape offer (as Snape would say$LABEL$2
I definitely have a love-hate relationship with this place. If you don't live nearby$LABEL$3
The good: large selection. The bad: the crazy high prices$LABEL$2
I much prefer shopping at Trader Joes$LABEL$3
Let's be honest$LABEL$3
I don't care for this Giant Eagle$LABEL$2
Another bad experience.  The staff is sloppy.  The deli doesn't mark the product and passes off whatever slimey old crap they're trying to get rid of as what you ordered.  And good luck parking.$LABEL$1
I got tired of waiting in line with one register open and 10 people in front of me. Won't be back.$LABEL$1
I really like this place. Love the selection$LABEL$4
Oh$LABEL$3
Shopping at this place is so frustrating you will want to throw knives when you leave.It's always packed$LABEL$2
Items don't have price tags. That's the only reason why I gave them such a poor mark. I hope that caught their attention. I try to buy produce and a lot of times many of the items I seem to select have no price tags$LABEL$2
The Holidays are coming and in the 'British' section they are not selling Vegeta seasoning anymore.$LABEL$3
I needed Italian bread for an event so there was no choice except to buy the bread that was available. The bakery had plenty of Italian bread but therein lies the problem- I buy Italian bread on an almost weekly basis so I know the way it's supposed to look as well as cost. For about the third maybe fourth time now the bread yeast hasn't risen all the way. It looks like squashed sourdough bread instead of Italian bread. Instead of about 4\""-5\"" it's about 2\"" thick. To add insult to injury the bread even costs more during the times it was thinner. Instead of the bread costing $2.49 just like any other day it cost $2.69 when it's thinner. Does that make any sort of logical sense? I am disappointed and this review is emotional in nature but there are actual facts here as well.$LABEL$1
Everyone complains about how expensive Whole Foods is in this area$LABEL$1
I mean$LABEL$2
I love coming in here!  It makes me feel like a kid again!  They have a lot of toys like Lego$LABEL$3
I'm sorry to say this$LABEL$3
Now listen here$LABEL$4
This review is a bit biased because the only reason I walked in here was because I had a gift card. This store really isn't my thing: it's way too upscale and expensive$LABEL$3
Ditto on the Pizza heading. This is and alwasy will be a bar for me$LABEL$3
Not quite dive bar$LABEL$3
I've gone here a few times and had o.k. service.  Nothing is ever impressive$LABEL$3
Doc's Place offers cheap bar food in a chill atmosphere.  The biggest perk Doc's has to offer is their price.  There is always a special on something on the menu every single day$LABEL$3
I never really understood why Doc's was so popular.  I personally find its only real saving grace to be the outdoor deck.  Otherwise$LABEL$1
Decent price on domestic pitchers. Entrees were half off but all looked mediocre. Tried the jambalaya and it was so so. Big groups of patrons led to pretty slow service.$LABEL$2
I've enjoyed Doc's Place for what it is - your average \""Bar\"" - nothing spectacular but nothing excessively horrible.  They are very accomodating for throwing parties or events in their location so that's a huge plus.  I've had numerous events there and it's always turned out great.The food is average and I don't pay much attention to the price of drinks b/c I'm usually with a large group and we take turns purchasing pitchers.  All in all this place is \""A-OK\"".  As most people mentioned the deck is fun and its a great place for groups.$LABEL$3
Doc's is a decent place in the Spring and Summer$LABEL$2
Drinks are watered downHalf off burgers and pizzamakes it worth the trip.(b)$LABEL$3
Doc's is a good bar to go to when you are with friends and don't have any set plans for the evening.  However$LABEL$2
The pedicures at DeStefinos  are a complete rip-off. IMOWhen I booked the $53 pedicure$LABEL$1
I'm changing my review after a bad hair cut that was not handled correctly. I went in told her what I wanted$LABEL$1
Although this store has great employees$LABEL$2
I ordered pictures through the online photo center and requested them to be printed and picked up from this location. I selected and paid extra for same day prints and were told online that they'd be ready in 1-3 hours. I went to pick them up several hours later and the guy behind the counter couldn't find my photos. He said$LABEL$1
Friendly front desk. A little condescending toward the back. Lovely jewelry$LABEL$4
When I started looking for an engagement ring for my wife$LABEL$5
Tiffany prices with Kay Jewelers selection.I've gone to this place a couple of times to look for various items over the past few years.  Every time I leave the store I always try to remind myself never to come back.The prices are way more than what they should be.  Tacori rings and other merchandise is marked up about 30-40% more than other jewelry stores in Pittsburgh.I've had a couple of nice salespeople work with me$LABEL$1
I just accepted a beautiful ring from Hennes. I have had nothing but compliments and I must say that the ring was beautiful. Unfortunately within 4 days one of the diamonds on the halo was missing. I'm sure that this is a fluke and will be taken care of. But my new fianc\u00e9 is very upset by this.$LABEL$2
I ate here last night.  There are aspects of the space that I really appreciated such as the stone walls and artwork.  It's very cozy and seems like a nice escape from the hustle of walnut$LABEL$3
I've recently moved away from Pittsburgh$LABEL$5
Cozy and comfortable$LABEL$4
I recently had a horrible experience at Girasole. I used to really enjoy going to this restaurant due to its cozy atmosphere and decent Italian food. However$LABEL$1
After my bad service experience at Girasole$LABEL$4
Girasole is a great$LABEL$5
I've been a fan of Girasole since it opened.  I love the quaint$LABEL$4
I don't know if coming early would help any... but when we got there at 8pm$LABEL$4
We were disappointed. A client recommended Girasole to us on a recent trip to Pittsburgh. While the food was alright (not spectacular) our waitress was the worst and for some reason$LABEL$2
Girasole is a small Italian restaurant off Walnut Street that serves up decent Italian food.  I've only been to Girasole during dinnertime$LABEL$3
Oh how I wanted to like this place$LABEL$3
Very very nice small Italian restaurant . Seating is very limited but food and service are wonderful . My only small complaint is the price for a bottle of wine is a little pricey . They should make at least several bottles a bit more reasonable .$LABEL$4
They need to take out about 4-5 of the tables they have packed in this place - Way to crowded.    Not to mention there was a guy singing and playing an accordion on the night we went for dinner.  Would have been fine except for the fact that there are 10 people too many in the place to begin with and then he wanders around the dining floor going table to table.  Wanted to pay the guy to stop for 30 min while I ate!Pasta dishes are way overpriced and honestly not that great.  $20 for noodles and meat sauce... Dinner specials/entrees are your best bet and were very good. but also way over prices.    Didn't have desert but multiple people in my dinner party raved about one of the cakes they had.   Simply put - this place does not execute the level of food their price points represent.  I'm all for paying for a good meal but when it falls short.... and this place does!Overall a very disapointing night out.$LABEL$2
Great place to get an authentic meal. Great wine selection with generous portions. The house dressing is to die for.$LABEL$4
After seeing a few bad reviews on other blogs I felt compelled to write a review of my own. I've eaten here numerous times and always had a wonderful experience. The food is amazing$LABEL$4
In Boston's North End$LABEL$4
Really disappointing. Service is bad when you enter. If it is busy expect to be treated poorly. Have a reservation? That will be ignored and you will wait like everyone else. Once seated servers are pleasant and nice$LABEL$2
For starters$LABEL$3
OVERALL:Given the popularity of Girasole$LABEL$2
I ate here last night with a dining partner.   Having read many of the reviews on this site we went early on a Tuesday evening and were seated in one of only two empty tables.  We had thought about getting reservations but the hours that came with my gift card said No Reservations.  The decor of the restaurant was very nice. They had copper tables in a cramped type of environment that is very European.We decided to forgo appetizers this day and instead got drinks.  I had something that resembled a manhattan while my dining partner had the Bellini and both were good.  Since my dining partner and I both ordered entrees we were served with a dinner salad.  It was one of the nicer salads that I have had with Gorgonzola$LABEL$4
I've been to girasole many times and have loved the food. The reason for the low marking is because of the service the last time I visited.It was over the holidays and my family was in town. Since we were a party of 5 I called the day before to make reservations for 8pm on a Wednesday. We got to the restaurant prior to our reservation time and they said it would be half an hour. We are easy goin people so we didn't mid waiting.The owner instructed us to go to the bar next door and have a drink. After 45 min I went back to the restaurant since they hadn't called us yet and he instructed us to go back to the bar.Finally after waiting an hour and a half they finally sat us. This bothered me for two reasons. 1. The people who got say before us did not have reservations$LABEL$1
Coming from an Italian family and being a foodie$LABEL$4
We ordered in from work.  We had a fish$LABEL$3
My wife loves the gnocci.  It's a bit cramped so make sure you have reservations.  The menu is small but I've always found at least on dish to my liking$LABEL$3
What a production! I don't even know where to start...The place is small.  They didn't lie to me when I made the reservation.  Of course we had to pick the busiest day and time$LABEL$3
This is the place I imagine sneaking into on an evening spent with that charming someone who captures your heart with the slightest smile. Late spring$LABEL$4
Came here for dinner to celebrate my brother's graduation from Tepper School of Business at Carnegie Mellon. Though the reviews were great and food looked yummy$LABEL$3
5 stars. 'Nuf said.$LABEL$5
We went there on a Thursday night around 6pm and the place was packed. The space is small to begin with so they crammed the 3 of us in at the end of a long row of tables. We were also seated by the grumpy older Italian guy with the glass of wine as also mentioned by another poster. I found him interesting and humourus. Having a close Italian friend growing up being in the restaurant reminded me of dinners at her house with her big extended family. Everyone talks loud but are all laughing and having a great time. I really enjoyed the atmosphere. The food was awesome. I had the spinach and ricotta ravioli and the sauce was to die for. My husband and daughter both penne with marinara sauce$LABEL$4
My girlfriend has been a regular of this place for years and could not wait to take me when I came in town for the Steelers game. We did not make a reservation and showed up on a busy saturday night around 8:45pm fully expecting a long wait. My girlfriend had forewarned me that there will be a wait so when we showed up we just expected to put our names down and go across the street for a drink while we waited. We ended up waiting in the front of the restaurant for ~20 minutes without anyone taking down our name. A few waitresses mentioned that the older italian guy (owner) took down names. We were ignored several times by him as he came up front - no biggie we saw it was busy. An older woman came up to us several times and asked if we had been helped$LABEL$1
Food was excellent but we hated the ambiance! Reservations at 7:00 pm Saturday. Arrived on time. Couldn't get in the door to wait for them to clear table because there were so many people in the narrow entrance; had to stand outside in cold weather. The place was so loud$LABEL$2
Wow. The food here is to die for.I highly recommend this place; however$LABEL$4
From the other reviews I really had high expectations for this Italian restaurant - was hoping for some authentic Italian food. Not the case. Not a lot of pasta options and those that were on the menu weren't homemade. It's unlikely I will return because the food was mediocre$LABEL$2
DATE NIGHT! After the Point State Park fountain reopening fiasco$LABEL$4
The food is incredible!! Despite getting caught in a thunderstorm$LABEL$5
Hard to get seating on Saturday and the noise level is high. Nice atmosphere and the staff are very friendly and good at what they do. The scallop appetizer and salads were good. I had issue with the pasta and you cant have issues with pasta in an italian restaurant.  The marinara sauce was too much tomato tasting acidic and lacked balance. The spinach ravioli was too much cheese and cream$LABEL$3
So$LABEL$3
My boyfriend and I had just casually walked by Girasole to see what their menu looked like. Before we even asked for a menu$LABEL$1
Food here is out of this world good.  The venue is extremely charming too.  Service was a disappointment.  Couldn't help but get the feeling that we were annoying our waitress just by being patrons.  Speed was fine$LABEL$4
I love Girasole for lunch. I always get the Girasole salad. Sometimes I am a little adventurous and do shrimp instead of chicken. Adventurous$LABEL$4
Girasole is a great Italian restaurant in shadyside. Make a reservation. . . it gets crowded and hectic on Friday and Staurday nights. It's small on space but big on atmosphere from the neghborhood to the patio seating to the decor!  The gnocchi is fantastic. They have a pretty broad italian wine list and great deserts. Not too terible on the wallet. Only gripe is the small real estate inside which tends to lead to slightly cramped seating.$LABEL$5
LOUD!When someone says the name Girasole's - that's the first thing that pops into my head. So loud you have to essentially shout to have a conversation with your table-mate. Small place$LABEL$2
www.bigtsreviews.com$LABEL$5
Most times$LABEL$2
Awful service. We made reservations 4 weeks  and when we showed up the host yelled at us because they were over booked and his excuse was it was God's fault because the weather took away his outdoor seating. He also didn't offer us an apology and kept on telling us where we couldn't stand. The most annoying part is that he was drinking a glass of wine the entire time while shuffling people around! Wish we could have tried the food$LABEL$1
After 2 years on the west coast$LABEL$4
Visiting the east coast makes me realize how bad the average bay area Italian place is. Sure you can find good stuff$LABEL$3
Beware the loud-mouthed lout working the front. We stopped by a couple nights ago and asked to check the menu. Finding it acceptable -- despite an abundance of starch with minimal protein -- we walked away to go find the other members of our party to return and ask for a table. But we were accosted by a boorish old man who kept yelling \""Hey!\"" until we turned around to see what he wanted. Come to find out he wanted to insult us by telling us to check out the hamburgers across the street if we didn't want or couldn't afford his fare.Well$LABEL$1
Girasole is a great example of authentic$LABEL$5
Beautiful ambiance$LABEL$5
Girasole is a tiny$LABEL$3
The owner has a complete disregard for customers and the customer experience.  I arrived with my parents at 6pm$LABEL$1
Girasole was much hyped about by my friends but I was very underwhelmed. I dined there on a Thursday evening around 6.30 pm. It was a fairly cold evening so we sat inside. The atmosphere was quaint but the noise was so loud. We had to continually ask one another to repeat themselves. The meal itself was nice but nothing outstanding. Each meal comes with complementary bread and a side salad. A plus is that the menu is quite seasonal. I had the roast chicken with brioche stuffing$LABEL$3
It's been a minute since I lived in Pittsburgh$LABEL$1
I have been to Girasole 3 times now$LABEL$4
Come for the food and not the atmosphere or service. I Made reservations for 7 pm on a Friday. When we got there was a line out the door. After pushing our way to the front of the crowded entrance to inform the host we were here$LABEL$2
Food$LABEL$5
This is a a good interesting spot.  It's located on Walnut above Pamelas.  I don't recall ever having Peruvian food before$LABEL$3
This place has authentic peruvian food and tasty american style peruvian sandwiches.  Every day they have a choice of two or three vegetarian and two or three non vegetarian entrees.  They serve these with rice and side salad.  My favorites are pumpkin and potato stew and potato$LABEL$5
I liked La Feria slightly more as a store than as a place to eat.  Even though I didn't buy anything$LABEL$3
Summary: friendly neighborhood Peruvian eatery + gift shop. La Feria occupies the floor above the Pamela's in Shadyside. It does not have a large foot-print$LABEL$3
Nearly empty on a Friday evening around 8:00.  Service was fast and extremely friendly.  The menu is a decent size$LABEL$3
In the few weeks that I've been in pittsburgh$LABEL$4
I came here on a Friday night around 9 pm with my boyfriend and my parents$LABEL$4
La Feria recently changed their menu$LABEL$5
I'll eat here again and write an update$LABEL$3
Had the chicken here. Was somehow unevenly cooked and bland. So bland. Friend had a vegetarian special$LABEL$2
Not necessarily your traditional Peruvian food establishment$LABEL$3
Unimpressed.  Food is okay$LABEL$2
I've had pretty good dishes here. The flavors are varied and unique$LABEL$4
Went to La Feria for my first time today.  The setting is a bit odd with all of the crafts for sale$LABEL$3
I know this place doesn't have \""authentic\"" food. I know it's not always the friendliest place. I know it looks weird$LABEL$4
Can't emphasize enough how great this place is. It makes me sad that everyone goes to Pamela's when La Feria is right above it - I always go here for breakfast/brunch and am always extremely satisfied.It's a great environment: La Feria$LABEL$5
I came here with a friend last Feb.$LABEL$2
This place is amazing! First time here and it's a small place. Couldn't find it at first because its above Pamela's. needs a sign! Anyway$LABEL$5
This restaurant has a great concept! There were some menu items that would appeal to those who might not be comfortable ordering something \""Peruvian\"" but that is balanced by other items that are more ground in Peruvian authenticity. I ordered the Pollo a la Bah\u00eda which was a special -- I was quite pleased with my meal.The shop part of La Fer\u00eda had some great handmade Peruvian pieces that$LABEL$4
If you can't find this place$LABEL$2
I have had items dry cleaned$LABEL$4
I've had a lot of things both dry cleaned and altered at this place (several hundred dollars worth). He is consistently late and there were a  couple of instances where I had to take stuff back to be re-done. I've only gone because it is convenient to my location and reasonably priced. I will never go back though. The straw that broke the camels back for me was the most recent time when I had him alter two suits. We agreed on two weeks to complete the work. I came back in three and he hadn't even started. He told me the earliest he could do it was another week and then was late again. Seriously? How hard is this? I am now going to start a search for a more reliable place.$LABEL$2
He's a good guy$LABEL$4
They always take weeks to get things done & overcharged. I was ok with that when they did a good job. But then they stopped doing a good job. Not worth the hassle anymore & do a poor job.$LABEL$1
I brought two pairs of pants and two (cheap) blazers there to be altered.  He was very nice. However$LABEL$2
I went to Molnar's for a state inspection and an oil change.  I dropped off the car that day.  Later$LABEL$1
I've visited Molnar Service Center many times. My first visit was to have my VIN number verified for car registration$LABEL$4
They work quickly$LABEL$2
Fantastic service! I needed to get my engagement ring sized down and saw the great reviews The Collection had and decided to give them a call. I had my ring resized in a matter of about an hour. It came back nicely cleaned and polished and finally fits! Kerry was so nice and professional and I felt like I could trust them. Love it$LABEL$5
This is absolutely drunk food. For a $5 credit minimum you get 3 big crispy slices of plain pizza (for a rounded out $5). There's also a six pack to go that is pretty price but decent. The place$LABEL$3
This place capped the night after getting hammerred in Shadyside 95% of the time.  It was pretty much guaranteed the drunken antics that would go down here would make you crack up.  The food was mediocre at best$LABEL$4
Thank you to Bonnie T. who mentioned that Village Pizza had moved to 815 S. Aiken Ave.  I will leave my review there!  BTW that move also came with a name change - they are now S. Aiken Bar and Grille.I was so sad when I walked by the old Village Pizza and they were closed.  When I read that they had moved - I walked to the address and was even more confused that it did not say 'Village Pizza'.$LABEL$4
I get the feeling Mozart has caused a few grumbles here and there due to strict rental agreement policies and such$LABEL$4
I'm taking the previous poster's advice and contacting the BBB.After nearly 5 hellish years with Mozart$LABEL$1

I lived in The Pennsylvanian for one year.  It was so intolerable that I moved a month early and just ate the cost.The pluses: from a distance$LABEL$1

I have lived at Mozart for 3 years now. Like anywhere else$LABEL$4
Mozart Mgmt was the first landlord I have ever had. I rented a studio apartment$LABEL$2
Pros: Good location (Melwood$LABEL$2
I can only comment on the lease application process$LABEL$1
I lived in Mozart's Highmont apartment for the past two years. The rent is too damn high. It was $730 including utilities when I moved in. If you sign a lease now it's $830. It has hardwood floors... In between the gaping crevices in the floor and splinters galore. The kitchen appliances are 3/4 size so your oven will not accept 11\""X13\"" baking pans and the eyes of your stove are too close to cook more than two items at a time.This past winter was very snowy$LABEL$2
They just broke into my house without any notice to show around. They knocked so violently I almost mistaked it for gunfire. Then$LABEL$1
Mozart Management - Georgian on Ellsworth - AWFUL BUILDINGI have maintained video proof of all my miserable experiences living in my unit on the first floor for almost three months so far$LABEL$1
Okay I wrote my previous review when I was mad at them for breaking into my apartment. I want to provide a more complete and responsible review now$LABEL$1
Absolutely horrible. My sink has been overflowing onto my countertops and ruining my belongings multiple times. Management did not even apologize for my inconvenience.$LABEL$1
My personal favorite Pittsburgh bar. Notorious for fresh juice and strong drinks. For the first few years I lived in pgh this was our standard last stop before heading home. Not once did I remember leaving the bar. Things have slowed down a bit since then$LABEL$5
Everything other people have said is absolutely true: This is a great neighborhood bar with fresh juice for the drinks$LABEL$3
Stiff drinks$LABEL$4
Weird mix of local drunks and school crowd. Drink specials were nice. Had a pint of Brooklyn stout that was only $2.50. Pretty good deal compared to the Miller Light only type specials in other local bars. No tabs or credit cards$LABEL$3
So Mardi Gras was usually a must stop whenever I went out on a Friday or Saturday night in Shadyside during college. This bar is more of an older crowd but they do serve drinks the way I usually make mine. If you order a jack and coke$LABEL$4
What I love about this bar is how effortlessly cool--how beyond cool--it feels. And what Walnut Street lacks in watering hole quantity$LABEL$4
Good luck getting outWith your soul and belongings.Bring your own flashlight.(b)$LABEL$2
This is a total hidden gem. I was unaware that this bar existed till a friend took me here. We were sitting across the street at Mario's and he says to me$LABEL$5
Nice atmosphere$LABEL$4
This is without a doubt the best alcoholic's bar in Shadyside. Smoking permitted. Extremely strong cocktails. The downside is that its a bit pricey but you are compensated well in alcohol. The bartenders are good people. Downsides: poorly lit - on weekends it can get a bit packed - so packed that you have to stand and in such a small space that's a bit uncomfortable.$LABEL$5
Quite a cool spot and pretty underrated$LABEL$4
Really fun. Really packed on weekends. Inexpensive drinks. Also$LABEL$3
This place wasn't as lively as I expected. With a name like Le Mardi Gras$LABEL$3
I moved to California ~2 years ago and miss Mardi Gras more than anything else. Richie and crew provided a home for all$LABEL$5
Pros:This bar has a true dive feel to it$LABEL$4
.$LABEL$1
I love pams!$LABEL$4
Breakfast is always good. But too much Pamela's seems greasy. You can cook it all at home for much cheaper. However$LABEL$2
kinda overrated because its like the only brunch place in the immediate area... wait is always long and food is pretty mediocre... plus shady side has really declined as a shopping district... BR has gone pretty useless now that its so expensive... who would pay $17 for a thin T-shirt made in malaysia?$LABEL$3
We were visiting Pittsburgh and decided to try out Pamela's for breakfast due to all the great reviews.  Either their aren't many good breakfast joints or people have a very different taste there.  We found the food to be greasy and not particularly good.  I like the idea of thinner crepe style pancakes$LABEL$2
Best breakfasts in the Pittsburgh area.  Just make sure to bring cash - they don't take credit.$LABEL$4
Been to the one in Sq. Hill were there is often a line in the morning on nice weekend days. I've only been there when there was no line and I despise myself each time I finish my food thinking \""I could have gone home and put extra scoop of lard on my eggs and it would have cost less than 1/4 of what I payed at Pamela's\"".$LABEL$2
Great portions$LABEL$5
Wow I couldn't even eat all my bacon cheese omelette$LABEL$4
We met a group of friends at Pamela's for brunch$LABEL$5
The breakfast special here should be enough for most people. The pancakes are great. The service is generally very good too. The only bummer is the lines for this location (and all Pamela's locations in fact) are super long around brunch/lunch times.$LABEL$4
I walked over to Pamela's for take out breakfast while I waited for my friends to pick me up for our friend's wedding.I decided to get the breakfast special -- sausage$LABEL$4
Clean place.  Pancakes a bit too buttery for my taste (and health!).  But the vibe was good$LABEL$3
you must come here$LABEL$5
New Yorkers.... if you like Clinton St. Bakery$LABEL$5
After waiting in line for about twenty minutes our group was seated.  The place was completely packed.  It looked like someone's basement or garage with tables in it.  Various photos adorned the walls.  I tried the world famous hot cakes.  They were delicious$LABEL$1
Serve a good breakfast$LABEL$3
one of the best places for breakfast ever. It gets packed every weekend with students$LABEL$5
Two words: grossly overrated. If I am going to wait an hour for breakfast/brunch$LABEL$2
I really wanted to like this place because of all the positive reviews.  I love breakfast$LABEL$2
I live a few blocks from Pamela's and each time that I walk by on the weekends there seems to be quite a few people waiting (and others have raved) so had been wanting to try it for a while. After waiting 30-45  minutes on a Saturday morning for brunch$LABEL$2
Maybe this is blasphemy of some sort$LABEL$3
One of the best breakfasts ever. Awesome diner feel. Friendly service. Delicious corned beef hash. Addictive. And the best pancakes i've ever eaten - really unique and perfect texture. I wish i had a place like this near me. As good as it gets.$LABEL$5
How Pamela's became a Pittsburgh institution is completely beyond me. The food is average at best (think a step or two above Denny's or Waffle House). Pancakes were soggy and bland and the veggie omelete was chocked full of processed$LABEL$1
If you Love Butter this is the place for you$LABEL$3
I'm giving it a 4 but honestly$LABEL$4
Decent breakfast and great service. I found the much touted corned beef hash to be too salty but everything else we ordered was great. Overall$LABEL$4
um ridiculously good and so quick and filling. I shared the hotcakes and got a side of eggs and sausage. need both my sweet and savory. This place totally hit the spot.. 930 am SAT morning. um yah$LABEL$4
Blueberry pancakes were amazing$LABEL$5
A bit crowded$LABEL$4
Excellent food. Great omelettes$LABEL$5
This Pamela's has a much different environment than the one in Oakland. This had a much more intimate feel and was a lot smaller and less \""diner\"" -esque. The morning after breakfast special was pretty good with 2 large hotcakes (important sidenote: if a pancake and a crepe had children I would imagine this is what their child would look like$LABEL$4
I was here at the Pamela's in Shadyside a few weeks ago - dining companion and I were looking for a nice brunch-y place to visit. Naturally$LABEL$2
Not deserving of the rave reviews. Breakfast is cheap$LABEL$2
Ok! The best hash I have ever had. Their potatoes are \""bananas!\$LABEL$4
Great place for brunch. I love the breakfast specials$LABEL$4
Cash only.The 'famous' corn beef hash was not great- and heavily salted.  Eggs were good.Not great food / not a lot of bang for the buck / 3.0 from me$LABEL$3
This place was great! We had several different dishes$LABEL$4
We heard that this place had amazing pancakes and was always extremely busy. We took our chances and arrived around 9:45am. It was open seating and we were easily able to find a table.First off - you can only pay cash. That is a huge turn off$LABEL$2
Oh my goodness I absolutely love this place! Strawberry hotcakes have brown sugar creme cheese and whipped cream! Also love the chorizo sausage with eggs n hash! Fresh strawberries year round wonderfully delicious !$LABEL$5
Absolutely delicious food$LABEL$5
There are 2 types of \""Good\"" restaurants in Pittsburgh. There is Yinzer good and Actually good. This food is Yinzer good. Way too much butter and sugar. Yuck.$LABEL$1
We had to wait quite a bit for a table but once we got seated the food came out pretty fast. My friend and I ordered the chocolate chip banana hotcakes and Gail's famous eggs to share. The hotcakes were good as usual but I think it's over hyped. I didn't really like the eggs at all. It was creamier but it had this weird taste to it that I didn't like. We also got a side of bacon which was eh. We asked for the potatoes to be extra crispy and that definitely makes them so much better!$LABEL$3
Maybe \""yinzer good\"" isn't always such a bad thing. I went here the other morning and was quoted a 25-30 minutes wait time. It took 50 minutes. That seemed to be pretty standard so be prepared for that. Once we got in and ordered$LABEL$4
Pamela's is the hottest thing in Pittsburgh$LABEL$2
It was just OK for me. A cash only establishment that gets very busy$LABEL$3
Pamela's is a staple and a classic to the Pittsburgh region. I've eaten at 3 locations: Oakland$LABEL$3
Unless you've been here before$LABEL$1
They are unique to Pittsburgh and the crepes are outstanding.  The owner is a nice guy who made a point to say hello to some guests who I was with this morning who frequent much more than I do.  The place was packed at 2 PM on a saturday I can't imagine it being comfortable on a Sunday or Saturday AM.  The wait staff in general is off and I'm really not sure why.  I mean sure they are busy$LABEL$3
I had a salmon crepe here & it was delicious - broke me out of the habit of mostly eating dessert crepes. The only downside is that they only take cash... but there is an ATM just down the street. This is a great place to meet up with an old friend or acquaintance.$LABEL$4
This place has delicious$LABEL$3
I travel to Pittsburgh pretty often$LABEL$4
The crepes served by this establishment might very well be the culinary embodiment of a mind-exploding$LABEL$1
There is not much to say about this place.  The crepes are wonderful.  The savory crepes are generally accompanied by a salad of sorts.  The quality is great$LABEL$4
I'm no crepe connoisseur$LABEL$5
The best place for breakfast in Shadyside$LABEL$5
Cash only. It's a bit pricey for crepes$LABEL$4
The crepes here are good. They are tasty and they have a variety. However$LABEL$2
Fantastic savory and sweet crepes.  The light and very tasty crepes are served with a small salad topped with mandarin oranges and a champagne vinaigrette.  I have tried the salmon with creme fraiche$LABEL$4
Love Crepes Parisiennes$LABEL$5
French crepes are not the easiest food item to prepare and I certainly wasn't expecting Cordon Bleu quality. That said$LABEL$2
The breakfast crepe with b\u00e9chamel sauce is the best crepe on the planet! I have made many a trip to Pittsburgh under the guise of visiting my boyfriend.  Little did he know that I was really taking the 4.5 hour flight from San Francisco to have three or four of the best crepes ever created. As I said before$LABEL$5
A very unique breakfast place with great crepes (and tons of different kinds)$LABEL$4
After walking by this place what felt like a million times$LABEL$3
I really do enjoy stopping by the walnut location every week or so.  The French Breakfast tea with a savory crepe and salad is a great way to start a weekend.  While there's a huge list of crepes made-to-order$LABEL$4
Well$LABEL$2
Absolutely delicious! Love the Icelandic smoked salmon crepe and the Nutella crepe. However$LABEL$3
Pompous manager hung up on me twice (!) when I called to ask about wait times.  Have never boycotted a restaurant until now.  Mediocre crepes don't entitle that sort of bush league behavior!$LABEL$1
You come here for the first time$LABEL$4
The two stars are for the food only. Otherwise$LABEL$2
Amazing crepes!My wife and I love this place.  We often stop by and try different crepes$LABEL$5
I've never had a bad meal at this restaurant. The quality and consistency is excellent. The owner is the head chef$LABEL$4
Wait$LABEL$4
Boom! I love this place and I'm a 6'3\"" man with an appetite! Every time people want to go I think great crepes and Ill be hungry right after I eat but damn I am wrong with this place.   Breakfast crepe is my choice but they all look amazing. This place fills up fast so get in line order and grab a table. EAT!$LABEL$5
Really delicious crepes! I come here all the time and I love it.  The woman behind the counter always remembers my usual order.Things to know before going: Cash only$LABEL$5
You guys...oh no$LABEL$4
I liked the ambience better than the food.  I went there for the first time today$LABEL$3

I had such a pleasant experience at this store$LABEL$4
After a personal call and lengthy discussion on me wanting something unique and different and not a standard vase of flowers in our school colors of white and blue$LABEL$1
Used him a long time ago and to this day I still feel ripped off. Swore up and down to me he could do a job and came up short. very short. Then had the nerve to blame me.Now he has the nerve to stay open.Hate this place!$LABEL$1
A couple blocks away from the UPMC Shadyside hospital$LABEL$4
Perhaps it is due to my experiences in dtown Balto that I may have a skewed opinion$LABEL$5
I will forever remember this drive-through conversation:Welcome to Wendy's. Can I take your order?Yeah$LABEL$2
Just like every other Wendy's you've been to$LABEL$1
what is it with Wendys ?  They never get the orders right. If any of the employees would smile I would die from shock.  This review applies to many of the Wendys  that I have been to. Even in Florida.  Do they train them to be rude and ignorant ?$LABEL$1
Aw Wendys.. You get no love? Okay in everyones defense service is spotty. But c'mon. That frosty itself deserves atleast 2 stars :) (5 IMO)Funny story. 1/1/14 @ 3am. We just left Southside & were driving around aimlessly looking for places to eat. At last we spot Wendys & a drive thru line wrapped around. We wait.. & wait & wait. A few cars leave & we move. & wait some more. Finally we decide to leave after realizing it'll take forever to get through the line. We drive past the window & boom.. It's dark & closed. We look at the Wendys sign which states they close at 6pm new years eve. So a line of 20 cars including us all had a dummy moment the very beginning of 2014$LABEL$3
Even as a vegetarian$LABEL$4
This was my first Chinese food experience here in Pitt$LABEL$2
China Palace offers both Americanized Chinese Food and more authentic style dishes.  A good portion of their menu is populated by items such as General Tso's Chicken and Moo Shu Chicken$LABEL$4
The food here was greasy$LABEL$1
Ordered Peking duck for delivery at 5:30 yesterday.  I was told it would take 45 minutes$LABEL$2
For a quick$LABEL$3
I think I actually want to give China Palace four stars$LABEL$3
My husband and I ate lunch here--actually$LABEL$3
People who reviewed this place as being GOOD... obviously retain the taste buds of a snake (fyi: snakes have no taste buds).Came here with my parents while we were scoping out apartments for me to live in. Wanted to go to Pamela's$LABEL$1
This place was \""OK$LABEL$3
We used to visit this place most every time we went to Pittsburgh.   The menu has change and so has the food  I ordered off the lunch lunch special and the Kung Pao Chicken was average at best and the egg roll was horrible.  My friends has water chestnuts with black spots in their dishes.  We shall not be going back there.$LABEL$2
I liked it.  Huge portions$LABEL$4
I've passed by this place on Walnut Street many times without so much as a glance.  But when I returned to Pittsburgh after a trip to DC$LABEL$3
Mmmmmm$LABEL$4
I like Chinese food.  Americanized or authentic$LABEL$2
General tso's chicken... was bad... just bad... too soy saucy... it needs more tanginess... It didn't taste the way that it should be... I am never going to order their General tso ever again. Never ever whatsoever!$LABEL$2
After searching around Pittsburgh for the kind of Chinese food that can fill the void for Golden Chopsticks in Wheeling$LABEL$4
This is my favorite Chinese restaurant in town. Great location$LABEL$4
This place can pass as average if you order the right thing.  I have taken out from here about a dozen times in the past year mainly because it is so convenient to my place but after trying their sweet and sour chicken this last time I will probably stay away for now (soggy/slimy$LABEL$2
Was there at a busy time -- Mother's Day dinner -- and the service was poor$LABEL$2
Good food.  They use good ingredients and present dishes well.  If they weren't in Shadyside$LABEL$4
The worst chinese food I've had. I got the General Tso's Chicken and it came dry and very not spicy at all when I asked for extra spicy. Panda Express is better.$LABEL$1
Went here for lunch a couple of times and it seems to be a pretty average Chinese place.  Most of the options are typical Americanized sorts of things with few more traditional or authentic Chinese options.  The sauces for me seem overly sweet and syrupy$LABEL$3
Very Good!Got the Beef Stew in Hot Pot. Pretty Spicy$LABEL$4
This is my favorite place in the area$LABEL$5
Yuck! I  hadn't eaten here in years and it will be years until I return. The wonton soup was watery$LABEL$1
Not crazy about this place. The food is subpar and definitely purchased in bulk and not the greatest quality. The atmosphere is clean and the staff is friendly so that's why I gave them a 3 star. Good luck.$LABEL$3
Not very good Chinese food here. It reminded me of a cheap college place. They give you plenty of food but it is low quality. Could have probably went to another place and paid half the price for the same meal.$LABEL$2
I have never$LABEL$1
Disgusting...The general tso that I ordered for delivery tasted like fish. I called and Verna tried to convince me that it was because I made the mistake of not requesting white meat. She then tried to tell me that they don't deep fry anything with fish. This was interesting because I am sure that the shrimp egg rollls that I ordered were indeed deep fried...in the same oil that my chicken was fried in. She told me that the delivery driver would be there in an hour to pick it up and i call and she tells me that they only way for me to get the refund is if I bring it in myself. Very rude and horrible customer service$LABEL$1
I had steamed chicken and veggies along with hot and sour soup! I would never get tired of it!$LABEL$4
LOVE this place! Super-friendly staff. Soy protein with broccoli was suh. Flippin. Good. I was with 2 meat-eaters that loved it too. Go to their website for full menu --I don't see it here on Yelp$LABEL$4
Tyipical \""Chinese restaurant\"" menu and flavour. Environment and service is above average$LABEL$3
My Pittsburgh friend says that this is her fave store.  Well$LABEL$3
Not really for females under 45.$LABEL$2
This store is shameful to the Shadyside family. Upon entering the shop$LABEL$1
So I wrote a review but it was filtered. I think people should know how awful this place is before stepping inside. I have no ties to this place; I don't know any of the other owners of shops in Shadyside and I am 100% un-bias and wrote my review purely on my experience there. Why was it filtered?$LABEL$1
I have mixed feelings about Salon Cercone. On one hand$LABEL$3
Gary is great with coloring (blonde). It's a cool$LABEL$5
I am always super weary about going to a new place to get my haircut$LABEL$5
Best Salon in Pittsburgh! I've been going to Eddy for a few years now and he never fails to make my hair look a thousand times better than it does when walking in the door. I have super thick$LABEL$5
Very nice inventory$LABEL$3
2 woman in the store were very helpful and knowledgable. I haven't received my piece yet and its been about 5 days. Iffy about who owns the place but$LABEL$2
I didn't find the food all that flavorable$LABEL$2
Ok$LABEL$3
I've had pretty good experiences dining here$LABEL$4
Food$LABEL$1
How to review the Walnut Grill?--a place that served us quality food on a standard menu$LABEL$3
Too pricey for the quality.$LABEL$2
My meal$LABEL$3
While it has a somewhat trendy looking menu$LABEL$1
my husband and I went there for dinner this evening and while their bunches are usually lovely I don't think we will return for a dinner meal again.I ordered the steak mid-rare and asked for a Caesar salad for my side... the salad was terrible$LABEL$2
During the three or four times I've been here$LABEL$3
This place has cockroaches.People throw up in the booths.Pretty good white russian.(b)$LABEL$2
Came here with a whole bunch of girls on a Wednesday night due to their half-priced wine situation.  Actually$LABEL$3
Not too shabby.  I would call it a \""finer diner\"" in terms of the definition of a Diner.  The menu has your everyday American items; nothing too creative or imaginative.   It's pretty basic.  Salads$LABEL$2
Had lunch with my husband here yesterday after not eating here for years.  We shared the tuna sashimi and wild mushroom flatbread as apps.  Both were delicious$LABEL$4
This restaurant is in a great location and has nice ambiance. That is where the positive ends. The food is LOUSY. I paid $9 for a stainless steel mixing bowl of iceberg lettuce with a little frozen (OK$LABEL$1
The staff is super friendly every time I'm in this store. I think I've been there almost every month since there's always something there that I'd love to have and it's right down the street.  Whether it's random cooks tools like a 4\"" wide vegetable peeler (highly recommended)$LABEL$5
Generally speaking$LABEL$1
Great store!One of the previous reviewers seems to have had some bad experiences with service in the store; my experience thankfully hasn't been the same. I've always had helpful$LABEL$4
My hubby and I wandered around Shadyside on Saturday afternoon and made Williams-Sonoma one of our stops. It was warm (but not too warm) and sunny (but not too bright)$LABEL$4
Best Chinese food!!! Good delivery service$LABEL$5
BEWARE!! This car wash damaged my 2008 Yukon Denali . Spoke with one of the owners$LABEL$1
It's pizza$LABEL$3
Remember that saying$LABEL$2
This place is the bomb.  Great hoagies.  Great pie.  Fair prices.  Cheap delivery.  I have had a LOT of pgh pizza over the years$LABEL$5
The good: The ladies who run the registers are personable and helpful. Also$LABEL$2
I've taken things here a few times over the years. It's in a convenient location$LABEL$3
Graham's is tucked away among a few other stores that I rarely ever visit. The few times I have gone to Graham's the folks have always been very nice and have introduced me to a few different fatty and sugary treats that we all crave now and again. Each product I have had has always been tasty and fresh. I will come back once I work off the extra calories from my most recent visit.$LABEL$4
If you want to be completely ignored when you walk into a business$LABEL$1
Extremely rude lady works there on Sundays.  Called at 1:50 p.m.and wanted to pick up a cake for my daughter's birthday.  I was told that they had cakes available but to hurry because they close at 2:00 p.m. sharp.  I arrived at 1:58 p.m. and the rude lady would not let me in.  She kept pointing to the clock.  Pool customer service.  I will NEVER go back.$LABEL$1
Went to the monroeville location using a groupon for the free tooth whitening.  The first visit$LABEL$1
My favorite family Chinese in Pittsburgh!  Best Won ton soup$LABEL$5
A typical tavern with a basic bar menu of burgers$LABEL$2
As far as bar food goes$LABEL$5
Ordered chicken wings. They looked very unappetizing$LABEL$1
Blech! Darren's often too nice in his reviews. The pizza was really greasy$LABEL$2
Worst nail salon ever. I made the mistake of buying a Groupon for a mani/pedi here without really doing any research. Not a smart move on my part. The place was totally dusty and there was no AC. Being that it was like 90 degrees that day$LABEL$1
Everything about the pedi was ok except the polishing part.  12 hours later I had to wear shoes$LABEL$1
They do an okay job$LABEL$2
I had a mani pedi today and they were brutal....so painful!  Ask her to just push your cuticles back otherwise youre in for some pain.  She actually cut me during my manicure and I had to ask her to quit f ing cutting my cuticles it bled so bad.  It's like having the worst papercut you can imagine then it really did not feel good at all the one she put acetone on it.I literally had to take my hand away from her and say stop let's not mess with my cuticles anymore! The owner was sitting right there and didn't do anything or say anything. now I've got a gold sparkly nail with a nasty ass$LABEL$1
This has been our go to place for Chinese food$LABEL$4
I have been going to this place for as long as I can remember. Its a family-run type of place. I remember when one of the owners was newly married - then pregnant - then her son was running around the restaurant - and then he was server - then he did deliveries....  Its kind of nice to see a family business like this. Its not too common anymore!The food is actually really good!! I love Chinese food and always try to go get chinese food from unique places and this place is on par with some of the best I've had in San Francisco and Chicago's China Town areas. The shrimp in lobster sauce is amazing. :) They have a private parking lot and are very easy to find$LABEL$4
Meh. This is not my kind of place. The food always seems oily or greasy and doesn't taste that good. Plus they have yellow fried rice. That is a big NO NO for me. It is kind of like mushed cardboard. I don't like it at all. I haven't eaten here in a while and i don't think i will start anytime soon.$LABEL$1
Had dinner here the other night and it was lovely. The dragon phoenix soup was amazing$LABEL$4
If you like waterlogged pasta$LABEL$1
Horrible experience. The food itself was good but way over priced for what it was.  They charged us for every little thing.. extra sides of dressing after they brought the wrong kind to begin with$LABEL$1
Sad little place$LABEL$2
Probably 3.5 stars.Food allergy friendly with a lot of choices. Prices are fair with large portions.The greek vinaigrette with feta was really good. The food was fine for a casual meal--no complaints. Our waitress was pleasant$LABEL$3
Calabria's looks like a really beautiful restaurant from the outside. The landscaping is always kept up with and the building is attracting to most of us who drive by it often. Although$LABEL$2
Very unhappy with the sales people did not do what they said they would do service department is very good$LABEL$1
I'm from eastern PA and NJ...I wanted a simple Meatball Parmigiana sub. for dinner. Apparently Danny doesn't understand what this is or..doesn't know how to make one. I was told they have a meatball sub or a chicken parmigiana sub...but not a meatball parmigiana sub.  Are you kidding me?  How hard is it to split a sub roll down the middle$LABEL$1
Best Italian hoagies you can get$LABEL$5
Some of the best pizza I've had since moving to Pittsburgh. And they have good hoagies as well.$LABEL$4
Best Italian hoagie anywhere in the known universe. I have been eating these sandwiches for the better part of my life (I'm 45) and I still can't wait for the next one. It's the way they are toasted and the cheese caramelizes--and the dressing is just perfect. Honest to god$LABEL$5
Awesome place for a working guy to get boots and work clothes esp Carhart stuff ....I have gotten a few pairs of boots here and also got a pair of boots resoled here and it was worth every penny$LABEL$5
I really wanted to like this place. I really did. I had originally started coming here because I bought a groupon and was looking for a new stylist.My total experience here includes 3 haircuts$LABEL$2
GO TO PLAN B!  This is NOT a shop you want to give your business!  I have been a very good and generous customer for too many years.  If you are in Linda's chair (one of the owner's) you will get an excellent cut/color BUT$LABEL$1
I DID like this place for over 30 years and was a customer of Linda$LABEL$1
I had both of my card spray painted and they worked with my insurance to fix both cars with no cost to me. It took a little longer than I would've liked but they did good work.$LABEL$4
I was on vacation in Pittsburgh and had a muffler problem. Penn Automotive took a look$LABEL$5
The lady who runs the office is unpleasant and rude. Will not use this garage in the future.$LABEL$1
We like this supermarket - close$LABEL$4
UGH. I don't know why Pittsburgh has allowed Giant Eagle to basically have a monopoly on groceries in this city. Yeah$LABEL$2
Read other reviews and knocks about service.  If you ever go to Oakland location$LABEL$4
Fast friendly service and good sandwiches. This is a neighborhood staple that deserves your business.$LABEL$5
Amazing food. You can stuff your face to the point you hate yourself for $10.00. The shoe string fries are amazing and the subs are made fresh right in front you! I love the casual and down to earth environment. One of my favorite places to eat in the entire city!  The cash only policy isn't ideal and the .50 cent refills I don't agree with but an ATM isn't far if need be! My advice? Eat here! It's delicious.$LABEL$5
This has always been my favorite Chinese Restaurant in the Pgh area. Food is consistently very good - General Tso's is tender$LABEL$5
Please don't go here. I'm begging you. I wouldn't wish this place on my own worst enemy. I wouldn't wish this on the girl who cheated on my best friend. This place was a literal nightmare. .I think I've been to Jimmy Wan's 4 times this month$LABEL$1
After receiving multiple recommendations for this place$LABEL$4
I used to frequent Tai Pei once a week or so$LABEL$1
We visited with a Groupon last Thursday. We ordered the Hot and Sour Seafood Soup$LABEL$1
I pass this all of the time but finally decided to stop.  The restaurant is incredibly clean and it was great service$LABEL$2
Most dishes on the menu are American style Chinese food. Not a bad choice if you just want to have a quick bite at lunch time. I felt that the food there is a little pricier than it should be. Aside from these I do recommend their basil chicken$LABEL$3
Really$LABEL$4
just got back from TaiPei. today was dinner AND a floor show. First$LABEL$2
Food was very bland$LABEL$2
I ordered from this place and the staff was INCREDIBLY rude when they delivered my order. The woman not only rang my doorbell 5 times but she BANGED$LABEL$1
They charged me $512 for a single visit with 2 rabbits WITHOUT ANY HEADS-UP - and they most definitely did NOT provide $512 worth of services. I was sick to my stomach when I left. VCA Fox Chapel is a rip off and they provide a disservice to animals and pet owners. After seeing the breakdown of the bill$LABEL$1
Truly$LABEL$5
I took a high end designer purse to be fixed here! It turned out better tan expected! The fixed the strap without any hint of repair! They do a great job on shoes! Great place to do business!$LABEL$5
Meh$LABEL$3
Somewhat disappointed would best be the title for my review.Before I begin$LABEL$2
Good coffee - I'll give them that. But beware when using your debit card here. I don't know if it's their software or employee error$LABEL$2
Best place in da 'burgh for the frequent traveler!$LABEL$5
I tend to prefer this location of Thai Place because it is always so quiet.  The menu seems to be identical to that of the Walnut Street location.  All of the curry dishes are good here$LABEL$4
Excellent food with great service.$LABEL$4
Bumping up my stars because I have recently found out that they use a soy sauce in their sauces that is gluten free! Feast away$LABEL$5
Okay food.  Number of other guests is often zero - uncomfortable.$LABEL$2
This is my first Thai food restaurant I have eaten at in Pittsburgh and I love it! The Tom kha soup with vegetables is delicious and so is the butternut squash curry. The mango sticky rice is the best dessert!!$LABEL$5
Ok food...nothing great...many better Thai restaurants in Pittsburgh!$LABEL$2
Really good Thai food.  Very friendly service and management.  Food is prepared promptly and is consistently good.  I wish that they DELIVERED!!  We eat their food often.  The decor leaves a lot to be desired$LABEL$4
Love the staff and LOVE the thai pad.  Yummy!$LABEL$4
I have been a customer at this music store not only for gear since I started playing drums$LABEL$5
The sale/price/trade all went smoothly.  The salesman proundly presented a clean carfax.  The car has been good except:1.  a google search of the vin revealed that the front bumper$LABEL$2
By far the best cigar/ pipe selection  with a lounge in the Pittsburgh area!  Great employees and very knowledgeable as well ! A must to come by too!$LABEL$5
Went here because we saw it on the Food Network Diners Drive-ins and Dives.  Their pierogies were the featured food of course.  It's just a small bar.  We went on a Sunday afternoon and there were a bunch of old guys sitting around the bar smoking and talking about the old days.  The bartender was also our waitress.  Aside from first-impressions$LABEL$4
We went to this place also after seeing it on D$LABEL$1
The food is pretty good especially if you like perogies but good luck getting it. I've been here a few times to see acoustic performances and every time I'm here the waitress spends more time smoking cigarettes at the bar than attending to her tables. 98% of the time I have to go to the bar to get another beer. But damn the perogies are good.$LABEL$1
Man this place is a dump. If you're not a local or regular good luck feeling comfortable there. It is obviously a local bar first and restaurant second. Certainly not for the ladies or kids. The pierogies were indeed delish and the fish sammo was okay. It was cooked nicely but the fish wasn't all that fresh and you could tell. Btw$LABEL$2
My dad wanted to go to this place because he saw it on TV. I grew up on in dive bars plopped on stools next to my grandfather as he drank Budweisers. Thus we felt at home.This is a dive bar. A real dive bar$LABEL$3
We're visiting from Milford$LABEL$3
They have 4 gourmet cheese sticks with marinara sauce for $7.95. No$LABEL$4
AWFUL!  The hub bub about the decor$LABEL$1
Food is bar food nothing great. But it is a good time. Karaoke was fun if you know your songs from the 70s and 80s. Fun crowd that just wants to sing and drink no drama$LABEL$4
This little smokey hole in the wall is a really cool spot.  The decorations are what bring everyone here.  Every inch is covered and it is something to be seen.  If you are in the area at Christmas time it shouldn't be missed.$LABEL$4
Hard drinking local crowd. Simple pub food. Friendly and relaxed local bar with a holiday by holiday light show extravaganza.  Unfortunately experience marred by intense smoke. After an hour there hair and clothes$LABEL$3
My wife and I meet there for dinner after work occasionally and generally feel the food is pretty good for the price and usually have decent waitress. The last time I was there the waitress kept disappearing and we had to ask another one for another drink and she never came back to see how we were doing. By the time we were ready to go we were pretty disgusted and I asked another waitress to take our check$LABEL$3
love love love the steaks they make!!! there are times when I beg my husband to take me to applebee's because I want their stake; I eat stakes everywhere$LABEL$4
I stayed at this hotel for four nights$LABEL$3
This hotel is in need of a renovation. This becomes most apparent when you look at the bathrooms$LABEL$2
I was there for couple of drinks with my friend who was stay a night at the hotel. It was the worst experience i have ever had in a bar in Pittsburgh. When i got there my friend was having dinner at the table and i joined we. I was there only for drinks so i asked the server if i could have a drink but she suggested re restaurant is closed so i will have to get a drink at the bar area. Shortly after that i see her serving other ppl around me in the dinning area and when i asked her about it she told me it was last call and they were also having a drink so it was ok. Honesty it was a weird experience and i wish i could complain to somebody about it being it's such a big chain of hotels. I asked the server If I could talk to the restaurant manager she said sure but the manager never showed up.$LABEL$1
I love the Radisson!!!$LABEL$5
Big hotel. Not bad. Bathrooms way too small I had to dry off outside the bathroom. Priceline for good rate.$LABEL$2
This hotel is old and janky and the friendly$LABEL$2
Where to start ... First we checked in after trying to park for seemingly forever (we noticed on the way out - that the sign directing you to the parking deck is only posted on the way OUT of the property - not on the way in so when you come in late and it's dark$LABEL$1
Stayed here overnight and wished we realized how busy of a hotel this place was before checking in. We stayed over a weekend in the summer and upon check in$LABEL$2
Nice to find a dead fly on the bed after checking in! Nicely done.$LABEL$2
Pros: great place to host a event or special occasion$LABEL$3
Waited for last hotel bus which scheduled before 1pm from Conventional center to hotel from 12:40 to 1:00 pm. No bus showed up$LABEL$2
My boyfriend enjoys brewing his own beer and the guys here are wonderful. They always have the supplies and if they don't they can recommend places to get them! Everyone is always very nice and knowledgeable!$LABEL$5
I really want to give this place a higher star rating but can't because frankly I have experienced much better in the terms of friendliness and service. This place definitely has everything you need for home wine and beer making but for the most part I feel a store like this should have friendly people working here that are ready and willing to answer your questions or at least when you are the only person in the store.......acknowledge you. I have been into this store numerous times and have the impression that everyone in here is sort of pissed off to be here. I'm fairly new to home brewing (within the last year and half) and I have questions. This hobby has a lot of questions to be asked$LABEL$2
This place is pretty good.  The staff is pretty knowledgeable and helpful depending on who is working.  They are priced competitively with online resources$LABEL$3
This school is a terrible deal for what you pay.  I got my math degree here$LABEL$1
Perhaps it was an off night$LABEL$2
New digs are nice!  Service was solid.  Food was solid.$LABEL$3
I would give Carolina Auto Repair no stars if possible. I took my car here for a simple oil change. When I picked my car up and started to drive home my hood flew open and broke my windshield also destroyed my hood.John (the owner) refused to pay for the damages even though it was clearly his fault. He was very disrespectful to my father and I while lying about who actually did the work on my car.We are now going to sue him for damages.$LABEL$1
Don't waste your time or money.  My salad had a rotten tomato and a hair (not mine).  My waitress never offered another hairless salad even if I had wanted one.  The broiled flounder wasn't very hot and neither were my steamed veggies.  Both were SO BLAND I could have prepared a better version at home.  My mom had spaghetti with meat sauce and said it was just mediocre.  The owner asked how our meal was when I paid and insisted they use fresh tomatoes.  I'm sure they do but I had to spit mine out.  She discounted our drinks but I'll never be back!$LABEL$1
Worst wendy's I have ever been to in my travels all over the USA. Normally Wendy's is at the top of my fast food list. This particular location is HORRIBLE. AVOID !!!$LABEL$1
3x. So far so good.$LABEL$4
I have been to this location maybe 10 times in the past few years and every time I go through the drive through the order is wrong. No fries$LABEL$1
All I wanted was a quick burger to take out$LABEL$1
This is a Pizza Hut/Wing Street. i hate to review chains unless something really stands out$LABEL$3
I get take-out from here occasionally$LABEL$2
SmellsGood service$LABEL$2
Greasy spoon in Belmont! Quick$LABEL$3
Went to Captains Cap quite by accident$LABEL$4
My wife got food poisoning from here. AVOID AT ALL COSTS.....$LABEL$1
I have been going to this restaraunt for years. The service is great but the food is subpar at best. The salad bar has fake cheese and imitation bacon bits. The fish is ok$LABEL$3
The oysters and scallops where good but not $17 good.  This place is way over priced. If you come here be sure to check the prices before you order and ask if it's extra if you add scallops to to your meal.   Fired oysters and scallops over $17 here.  This will be the last time I come here.$LABEL$1
They claim to have some of the best burgers in town and surprisingly it was actually a pretty good burger. i ordered the cheeseburger with chili (i was told chili made in house) and mustard combo that comes with fries and a drink for like $6. The fries were blah crinkle cut fries which were fine and the ice for the drink cup came from a cooler of ice on the counter which seemed odd. It's kind of a dingy space next door to an independent pharmacy that they've attempted to give some life with a mural on one wall and some local Belmont stuff on another wall. Overall$LABEL$3
Had breakfast here one time and it was very primitive. Coffee was really bad.  I took one drink and trashed it.   Have been told they survive on the burgers.  Will have to try one and update but breakfast is a Not Recommend.$LABEL$1
i haven't stepped foot inside yet$LABEL$3
This time i dined in. They have a big menu on the wall and when i finally made up my mind$LABEL$3
Used to be my favorite pizza and sub shop but has really gone down hill the past year or so.  Many have mentioned how their recent visits have been dissapointing.$LABEL$1
Wanted something close and my husband suggested Sub Corral so we gave it another shot.  I called in the order and the man/boy that took the order was not friendly at all no thank you just a \""give me 20 minutes\"" and hung up.   The food was AWFUL.  I got the meatball sub and it was nasty (unedible) and the pizza was not good.  I will never go again.  I used to drive 20 minutes to get this pizza but now living in Belmont I will not even drive 5 minutes for it.  So dissapointing.$LABEL$1
really wanted a sub. and saw this place driving by on a road trip. thought I would support small business at the same time. but they don't even seem to have SUBS. The food was horrible- I think they served me fries from the day before and they weren't even reheated.  The staff was rediculously unfriendly... it's like the 70s down here still ;-/Wish I got the WO memo on this place and not wasted my money$LABEL$1
food was okay but the place is filthy. Tables were dirty. Dead flies in window seals. Window blinds have food residue splattered on them.  Ceiling fans have dust caked on them. Gross...$LABEL$2
Astonished!  Been eating their delivered pizzas for 8 yrs$LABEL$1
After living in the area for about 8 months$LABEL$3
Not a bad little bowling alley.  They have probably around 15 lanes but the place has never been crowded when we're there (which I enjoy).  The lanes are in good condition.  While the scoring system is old$LABEL$3
Cheap bowling$LABEL$5
Have been here on 2 different occasions with my family. Both times I was disappointed. A bowling alley should be a fun atmosphere. There was nothing$LABEL$2
I don't enjoy writing bad reviews$LABEL$1
Just your typical small town post office. Service is always pretty quick & the lines aren't entirely too long. They have all your mailing needs along with post office boxes as well. So nothing special$LABEL$3
Easy in$LABEL$3
I know its a chain$LABEL$4
This place is pretty good at getting the orders out quickly and most importantly getting everything you order in the bag. I did get the splats after eating here the last time but I can't be 100% sure it was from this food here$LABEL$4
I appreciate how clean it is here and that's probably because they have a lot of employees. Despite all of help$LABEL$3
I'm a big fan of mc d's but I was expecting more when I saw pork chop biscuit what a fail.$LABEL$2
12/11    Most unreliable WiFi in town. The manager will look you straight in the eye and lie to you about a cut antenna but I've tested with multiple devices and times/dates and know this isn't true.1/12     STILL the most unreliable WiFi in town! Does zero good to complain. Obvious they could care less.$LABEL$1
Having people that don't speak English very well taking orders in the drive thru is a recipe for failure.  I always try to double check but feel rushed because of the amount of people behind me. My order is right 50% of the time.$LABEL$1
Worst McDonalds in the United States of America. I could get food faster in a prison cell. You have a better chance of the Pope going to hell than getting good service here.$LABEL$1
My wife surprised me with a Living Social deal.  We went as a couple.  We had a blast!  Nice of them to run a LS deal.  Since I have been there last (5 yrs)$LABEL$3
On a weekday afternoon$LABEL$4
It is your standard-issue Chinese joint complete with the same menu$LABEL$2
Just like any other take out chinese place.  Super quick$LABEL$3
Get your wallet ready$LABEL$2
Bar foodDecent bar food though.Waitress was niceBeer was cold Cool paintings and artAtmosphere was warm and non pretentious$LABEL$4
Here for trivia night on Tuesday night. Love me some Christina but they are way under staffed. It took almost an hour to get out food. Good food but this is ridiculous.  We had to go to the bar to order drinks. They need to get some help in here or people will stop coming!$LABEL$2
I'm not one to complain$LABEL$1
Just had the worst experience at a nail salon. A older male nail technician did my nails and i usually get the pink and white fill. He needs another class with filling in the white part and an attitude adjustment.  See pic.  I told him I didn't like it he said I was picky and they looked better than what I came in with. What???? Really I said. Ok. He said it's not gonna be perfect cause it's not a full set. Smh. I had just the white done and both at the same time from my regular nail technician can't wait till she's off maternity leave so disappointed. Tips on other places I can go hit me up! Two stars for bad attitude and he knew it was bad he told me I didn't have to pay full price. So I didn't pay for the white. Still just messed up. If u go there don let him do your pink n white he probably good at other things just not that.$LABEL$2
Great nail spot in the northlake area - they recognize their returning customers$LABEL$3
we are members sines 2010 and we are very happy with the classes and the gym$LABEL$3
As a parent of a swimmer this is really not a great pool for watching a meet. The stands are small and the tiny results scoreboard is blocked by the crowd if not directly behind you. Parking is atrocious. The positive is the pool is pretty new and in good condition .$LABEL$2
HFFA is a year round gym and aquatics center.Pros:-No shortage of lanes for swimming.  When the pool is arranged for 25 yds$LABEL$3
Within the park exists the Historical Plantation$LABEL$3
Stopped here while visiting from out of town on a clear chilly day. It was Beautiful and the snow covered ground was neat! It appears to have some history here along with a lake$LABEL$3
Living in the burbs and spending most of my time in the city$LABEL$5
I definitely learned alot about the south here. Really glad we spent a few hours here.  Makes you appreciate modern times.$LABEL$4
Very cool family trip not a lot of activities and the costumed employees acted  like we were actually bothering them. Never the less it was fun and my daughter liked it$LABEL$4
I just got back from Christmas at Latta Plantation. I took my 12-year-old twin boys. We toured the small nature center first (minor point if interest)$LABEL$4
This was a fun little side mention on our trip along the eastern seaboard.I absolutely love history and although not the best historical point on our trip$LABEL$3
This place is great for the whole family. Admission was $8.00 because they were having a special holiday program. The grounds were just like it was back in the 1800's. The houses and cabins are in excellent shape. The gift shop was nice and the civil reenactment was nice to watch. This place is perfect for a great history lesson.$LABEL$5
My boyfriend and I were excited to try out the amazing maize maze on a sunday afternoon. We were disappointed. It costs $10.00 per person and for the price$LABEL$2
This is a great way to spend a few hours (or 45 minutes$LABEL$5
Wow! Talk about true to it's name - this place lives up to it!! Amazing. Maize. Maze.It's located out in the middle of nowhere - but thats where you're suppose to get lost right?!?The maze is huge!! They show you an overall map at the beginning and then give you a blank one with numbered squares. You have to go throughout the maze and find the numbered mailboxes$LABEL$4
I attended the evening flashlight maze on Saturday evening. Bring your own flash light. It was a ton of fun and the maze really lives up to it's name. This year's maze was made into a baseball theme. The orientation is crucial for tips and hints on getting through the maze. The staff is also helpful during your trek through the maze. Don't be afraid to ask others for help. They also had a variety of fair food (funnel cakes$LABEL$4
I suppose I'm biased because I've always loved raptors$LABEL$4
*disclaimer up front*I am a transport volunteer for the injured raptors coming into this facility. Most of my \""deliveries\"" get euthanized because of the severity of their injuries... and I see this place as the single best way to educate John Q. Public about why these birds die needlessly every day. Before I became a transporter$LABEL$5
Although I'm scared of bird (I suffered a vicious peacock attack as a child (seriously))$LABEL$4
I love zoos and animals$LABEL$5
I took my kids here one afternoon when my wife was out of town on business$LABEL$3
Pricey$LABEL$4
Will never come here again!My cat has cancer and was experiencing some new symptoms that needed possible ultrasounds. We came to this CVS location because it was after hours and the CVS I usually go to in Matthews wasn't going to have the ultrasound tech as soon as needed$LABEL$1
I brought my dog to Dr Arnold for a initial exam for a torn CCL and to ensure he was ready for surgery. During the visit$LABEL$1
Beware of this place. We had a mini-dachshund that had a bleeding ulcer. Test after test after test they were still not sure what was wrong with this young 7 year old dog. Ultimately after about $3400 worth of tests they wanted to operate to see if there was something that they were missing. How much? Another $5000. Unfortunately he had already lost too much blood$LABEL$1
On multiple occasions they were not able to remove stains from the dresses$LABEL$1
This pizza is mediocre at best. Not really a NY style pizza - the crust is soggy$LABEL$2
My family actually prefers this place to other pizza places in the area - or did before they stopped serving the onion rings! This place had some of the best onion rings$LABEL$4
I wasted nearly twenty bucks on the driest and most boring white pizza ever! The whole dinner was nothing but a downer. Plus the sample we got was way undercooked$LABEL$2
Very good pizza!  This is usually our \""go to\"" for pizza when the kids aren't around (they prefer Pizza hut) .  Pretty authentic NY Style pizza although a little bit on the pricey side.$LABEL$4
If you ever thought it was impossible to wait too long in the drive-thru$LABEL$2
This is the Burger King that corporate forgot. The food is awful (which doesn't help because BK is generally nasty)$LABEL$1
Either my English muffin sandwich sat under a hot lamp all morning OR Burger King's kitchen staff just decided to deep fry the whole damn thing.  If that's not enough$LABEL$1
UGH.Nasty restaurant with nasty food. I can thank BK for ruining my dining plans this past weekend. Sometimes when you have kids$LABEL$1
I have to defend this local BK as it has gotten of a lot of bad reviews.(not saying they were not called for)But as of moving to Stallings and having this as the closest quick fast food they are not bad at all.We have gotten to know the crew$LABEL$3
I was in Charlotte visiting family over Spring Break when my engine started misfiring.  It was Good Friday afternoon and I was planning to drive back to Chicago the following day. All the auto shops were going to be closed for the holiday weekend$LABEL$5
I came to Tullock because my wife and i are big on Yelp. I recently purchased a vehicle after i lost my other car in a recent auto accident. The car i purchased had numerous issues and financially i was in a bind. I came hoping that I'd find a mechanic that was honest and that wouldn't take advantage of me. All i can say is Mr. Tullock went above and beyond his duties to help me. I can't even begin to say how thankful i am for his service! Mr. Tullock is a man of integrity and character! I seldom have ever came across people like him. Not only did i find a mechanic i made a friend! There's no one else I'd even trust my car with! All i can say is my family and i thank him from the bottoms of our hearts! We are in your debt sir! Tullock Automotive is 2nd to none! Hands down best shop in Matthews maybe even in all of North Carolina!$LABEL$5
When my car was down and out and I was trying to decide to fix it or junk it$LABEL$2
Zero stars really but that is not an option. After several failed attempts at other dealers i decided to give this place a try to fix some front end noise and shaking on my toyota avalon. First time and 600 dollars later i got new brakes and rotors. Left with car and still had noise and shaking. Called back and Gary the owner told me to return next day. Then it was the drive train and bearings so 2 days and another 1100 dollars later i pick up my car. Low and behold still shaking and return yet again for a 3 rd time and its another thing. Now im 1700 in and almost 3 weeks dealing with this and car still not fixed. So for the 4 th time i called and at this point i just wanted some of my money back. I did not feel it was working out nor should i have to keep returning for the fourth time with the same initial problem. As i tried to explain this is when Gary the owner became hostile and not responsive to my request.  I don't at all see how 2 weeks 3 return trips and 1700 bucks later and you have an attitude with Me? I don't recommend yes they seem nice until you have a problem BEWARE DONT FALL FOR IT$LABEL$1
We moved to Matthews in 1987 and bought a new house. The heating and air conditioning units had been installed by Custom Comfort. Whenever we have needed repairs or replacements we have used them. They are prompt$LABEL$5
We appreciate so very much the honesty$LABEL$5
Staff made you feel as if they were doing you a favor by waiting on you. Owner on the phone and didn't even acknowledge the customer.  Food was awful. Will never go back$LABEL$1
Not recommended. Szechuan beef tasted like ketchup. Spring roll spongy and tasted bad. Pork fried rice is OK.  My daughter likes the Sesame Chicken but too sweet for my taste.$LABEL$2
It is too bad I can't give this zero stars.  Eat at your own risk!  I had Kung Pao Chicken and got really bad food poisoning.   The chicken was all dark meat and tasted aweful. I will never go back here again.$LABEL$1
Had their pizza last night for my sons sleepover. None of the kids ate it and complained that it tasted metallic. It was indeed pretty horrible even for $5.99 per medium. We will never go near the place again.$LABEL$1
(Occurred last summer$LABEL$2
Everything was great except that the water in the shower WOULD NOT heat up$LABEL$4
I didn't wake up as a doctor.$LABEL$3
We traveled to Mt. Holly to attend a death in the family. Luckily I knew where the hotel was located or I would have driven right past the entrance. The parking situation is horrible. The parking layout is poorly designed and I spent far too much time waiting on other guests to park or drive past. The lady at reception did not greet us when we walked up to the front desk. I am an IHC Gold Elite member. The usual offer of bottled water was an after thought and she only offered a single bottle for two guests. There was no hair dryer in the room and when I called the front desk the lady responded as though I was lying. After a few minutes later a member of the housekeeping staff came to my room. She did not greet me as i opened the door. She came in and looked around the room as though I didn't think to look around for the hair dryer before calling the front desk. She did$LABEL$2
Worst service in the area$LABEL$1
Great food! awesome Margaritas!$LABEL$5
Got carnitas.. good food$LABEL$3
went there with my fiance and the food was not at all what i expected from the reviews.we got two hamburgers and an order of chili cheese fries. the bun was deflated and soggy. the burger meat itself looked promising but was burnt and vastly overcooked.. SAVE your money on the chili cheese fries. at $3.99$LABEL$2
Great BBQ plate$LABEL$5
For japanese fast food$LABEL$4
Went there last night$LABEL$1
It's MCDONALDS! You wanted a review.. Ok keep your panties on... here it is...The place is always slammed (yay for fast food).. You think going into a drive-thru is fast.. It's not. Make sure you check your order as it often comes back wrong - the place is run by 16-19 year olds I swear to god. It's a clean place. Well there's something.. It's fast food so you don't have to cook - although I don't know why I'm saying fast in anything because they are not here.. Lastly$LABEL$2
Stay away. Since my review nearly a year ago$LABEL$1
I've been to it a few times over the years$LABEL$3
Went right after lunch rush so it was a little messy$LABEL$3
I arrived late-ish$LABEL$5
This hotel was ok$LABEL$2
Perfect airport hotel.  Decent rooms$LABEL$3
Updated:  12/17/12The Good:  The staff was very friendly and helpful.  The front desk was very friendly (Lindsay at the front desk has been particularly friendly and helpful) at check-in and the restaurant staff were also very nice.  The room was clean and well kept with a ~24\"" flat TV and decent furniture.  The breakfast  has been improved since the last time.  The potatoes were much better than before and the eggs were done on a per order basis when it wasn't busy.  The bacon and was quite a bit better.The Not So Good:  Dinner was decent but still left a bit to be desired as far as seasoning and interesting flavors to their dishes.  They would do well to get a little more variety of beers on tap as well.  Yes it is a hotel by the airport but I've stayed at several hotels this lose to airports and they generally have better windows to isolate some of the noise.Overall$LABEL$4
The staff was friendly and helpful. That's the only reason this place gets a star. After 10 hours on the road we stumbled in here thinking$LABEL$1
Not bad.  Large and tasteful lobby$LABEL$3
Starwood Hotels$LABEL$2
This hotel looks a lot better than it smells. The lobby has the stench of too much cheap air fresher and the rooms$LABEL$2
The good:  The staff in the evening at check-in were friendly and helpful.  After getting stuck in Charlotte due to weather in Chicago$LABEL$2

The recently remodeled Belk at Carolina Place is looking pretty fantastic.  I am a long time Belk shopper$LABEL$4
Belk at Carolina Place always has amazing customer service. They often compensate when you forget a coupon at the register.$LABEL$3
This is my favorite wing place.  The owners are really nice and they are very accomodating if you have any special instructions for your wings.  Lots of flavor combinations.  This is a place where you want to place your order to go.   I suggest the Red Tang flavor.  Yum !!  They are also now doing Pizza although I've never tried it.http://tlcwingsandgrill.com/$LABEL$4
I love these wings!!!There are so many flavors here....and I've enjoyed a lot of them...like$LABEL$5
I've been a longtime loyal customer of this place (2005). My husband and I just called to order delivery and the girl that answered the phone hung up on him. When I called back she told me \""that wasn't me$LABEL$1
This business has been here for several years$LABEL$1
I used to love this place for the wins and the staff. But I'm not sure if they sold or just changed staff around$LABEL$3
I reviewed TLC back in Feb.$LABEL$5
Ive been a customer for years and i went there today amd my chicken sandwhich i ordered it was completely frozen i took it back and they made me a new one with no sauce on it and it was completely dried out and over cooked. And the guy wanted to argue back. Im never going back.$LABEL$1
sick...and not in the way my college roommate use to say \""that's sick! \"" (meaning cool$LABEL$1
I don't understand the super low reviews on here$LABEL$4
I never much cared for Firehouse in the past. But$LABEL$4
Ethan Allen is the type of furniture store where you encounter consultants.  A panel of \""American Idol\"" judges (although...nicely dressed ones) will meet you as you walk in.  The eyes will quickly look you up and down to vet your level of purchasing power.  They probably saw the vehicle you rolled up in as well.While helpful$LABEL$3
Service was terrible!! My sister and I walked in this location and were not even greeted with an hello. As we browsed through the store 2 of the sales associates went in the opposite direction when they saw us coming. On our way out of the store both associates were at the front of the store shouting goodbye. I proceeded to tell them I noticed we were intentionally being ignored$LABEL$1
In the past when my husband and I needed to purchase good quality furniture we always went to Walter E Smith in the Chicago area.  Since living here we made the change to Ethan Allen.  We purchased a full living room from them this past spring and have been very happy with almost everything.  The service was great and the sales person listened to us and put together exactly what we wanted with one exception.  We asked for tables (specifically a coffee table) that could stand up to some abuse because we have a 16 month old at home.  The table he recommended is beautiful but does not at all stand up to what he said it would.  This table is only 3 1/2 months old and already has wood chipping off$LABEL$2
Garden Ridge has just turned into a junky flea market.  GAG !!!$LABEL$1
This is the ultimate home decor store! And very reasonably priced. They have the best selection of christmas ornaments around that If you are like me and you buy ornaments for gifts of teachers and your childrens friends you will be glad! BUT you must shop early in the season like right around Thanksgiving because they will be gone in a hurry.Need fake potted plants of all sizes$LABEL$4
I bought some Halloween lights there a few weeks ago that did not work for$LABEL$1
Garden Ridge is not the same...it has really gone downhill.  It seems that they have bought out other stores of items that did not sell...junky items.  Every time I go in there I can never find anyone to help me and they only have one register open. Their shopping carts are all rusty and broken. I miss the old Garden Ridge.$LABEL$2
Is it me or have the prices at Garden Ridge gotten ridiculously high? I admit that I'm more of a seasonal Garden Ridge shopper - Christmas season$LABEL$1
Having just moved to the area with my resplendent girlfriend$LABEL$2
Convenient to Carowinds theme park$LABEL$3
Very dated$LABEL$2
For what you pay here$LABEL$3
Went to buy boots for the girls. Pretty uneventful. Looks like the cast from any Disney show stocked the entire place. Staff was nice and helpful. The girls jumped up and down at every glittery thing they saw. Oh$LABEL$3
They've got boys' clothes.  They've got girls' clothes.$LABEL$3
It is a good alternative to BassPro and a much shorter drive for me. The selections are a bit limited but for the most part I can find what I need. Since they have renovated the store their hunting supplies have increased a little but would like to see a bit more.$LABEL$3
Oh Dick's!  Bet you never started a review like that before.You never cease to underwhelm me with your mediocrity.  We sort of have good stuff$LABEL$3
I've been to several Dick's sporting good stores and this one is by far one of the worst. A few years ago I took my mountain bike to them for a basic service. Upon picking it up I realized that my high end pedals had been switched with some of the ones they use on their floor. I brought this up to the staff's attention who didn't hesitate in saying that I was wrong and they don't do that. I asked to speak to the manager an nobody was there from the management staff. I asked them to go review their security footage and they said they didn't want to do that either. I took this issue up their corporate ladder and all they did was apologized.I since stopped frequenting them. Sadly due to lack of options from a similar retailer in the areaI had to visit this location again recently$LABEL$1
Thank you everyone who posted reviews. Due to the information I have now researched$LABEL$2
Went for lunch today - and very upset that they now CHARGE a $3 fee for a basket of the pretzel rolls at lunch!Suggestion to the restaurant - simply ask each table if they want bread.  If they say no$LABEL$2
I dislike when people give low reviews because of uncontrollable factors like other loud guests and too many people.  If it's a good place$LABEL$5
Been to Germany? If not$LABEL$2
This is where the birthday girl wanted to go last night so this is where we went.Best surprise - a free slice of Black Forest cake with the purchase of any two dinner entrees.  This is the Tuesday special and it's large enough for two to share.Table ordered the wienerschnitzel$LABEL$3
Tonight was my first time here$LABEL$5
Great restaurant. Has a mug club that is worthwhile if you go here a lot. Their food is great$LABEL$5
Having been in Charlotte only a year$LABEL$5
Used to be so good...but the food and service has deteriorated in the last few years.Carpaccio....one of my favorite items on their menu is now served without toast points. You must request them...then they only bring a few. Last time it was served on a very hot plate...by the time we got the toast$LABEL$2
While I do revel in trendy$LABEL$3

Went to this place when I had some family in town for the Sunday brunch buffet.The food was pretty decent.  My grandpa is from Germany and my mom often made German food for us growing up.  It wasn't exactly like my mom's but I thought it was pretty good compared to other German places I have tried.I was not impressed with the lay out of the buffet.  Kind of had to stand in an awkward line where people weren't really sure where they were going or who was in line and who wasn't.  I would have loved to see Rouladen on the buffet as that is one of my favorites...I know they have it on the regular menu though.$LABEL$3
Went for the buffet on Sunday.  As another reviewer said it was set up weird.  Grew up on German food and this didn't compare. Probably good for a restaurant though. Should try ordering from the menu it might be better.$LABEL$2
You don't have to wear lederhosen to come to Waldhorn$LABEL$4
solid place.  excellent beer selection.  food is very good. prices are decent.$LABEL$4
Let me start by saying this. If it's lunch...ORDER A PRETZEL ROLL...or maybe 3! (They're free with dinner$LABEL$5
Full disclosure here$LABEL$4
THIS REVIEW IS FOR THEIR BRUNCH. IF IT IS SUNDAY BEFORE 230PM AND YOU ARE READING THIS - STOP. GO TO THE WALHORN. THEN RETURN TO SAID YELP REVIEW AND THANK ME. THIS IS NOT A JOKE. THIS IS VERY REAL.Sometimes there are things in life that you just can't express in words full how much such and such means to you. Or how much you hate it. Or love it. This is ALMOST one of those cases$LABEL$5
Went there for lunch not overly crowded but there was no hostess$LABEL$3
Maybe I just don't like German food but was very unhappy with all the food I tasted. It could have been what I ordered? I was disappointed with the selection of food as well. I ordered a Chicken Salad Sandwich and it had way too much sauce on it. My husband let me try a bite of his Rueben which was really good. My kid's loved the authenticity of the restaurant which made it worth it to see them so happy. I wouldn't choose to go back but I am guessing it's probably b/c German food isn't my thing.$LABEL$1
OMG! Why or why have I never been here before now. This place is awesome$LABEL$5
My family of (4) went to Waldhorn for Sunday brunch today.  We had been a couple of times in the past$LABEL$3
Never eaten here so this review is literally only for the Octoberfest  event they host.One word...fun!  Tons of authentic german music and lots of happy smiley people dancing around and having a ball eating brats and red cabbage.  That's the scene here.  I've been 2 years running and I'm a fan for life.It can get expensive and note they only take cash.  I had 4 liters of beer (2 people) and 2 brats w/red cabbage and it was $65.  Wow...kinda pricey but remember you are paying for the tents$LABEL$3
ALWAYS delicious! Oktoberfest is insane every year.$LABEL$4
Excellent service and the most delicious food! The waitstaff is very attentive and friendly and the manager Brian is awesome. My husband compares the kartoffelpuffer to the potato pancakes that his mom or grandmother would make - very authentic. They have a great selection of German beers and wines. The sauerbraten and gegrillter lachs are two of my favorite entrees. I also highly recommend the rindsrouladen and the schnitzel. The portion sizes are very generous; I always had leftovers to take home. The apfelstrudel is a must for dessert. While living in the Charlotte area$LABEL$5
One of our favorite restaurants!  Been there many times for Sunday brunch$LABEL$5
Wunderbar! Authentic! Eleven German draft beers. The server( Stefanie) was from Dresden and did a great job. Sauerbraten$LABEL$5
I took an out-of-town guest here for dinner.  Our hopes were up as we walked up to the building and then entered.The restaurant was busy with two private parties; however$LABEL$2
Went with a large group. Fast service$LABEL$4
Now I really try to like this place$LABEL$2
Everytime I'm in the area I stop here.  Great selection of German Beers.  Staff could not be more welcoming and friendly.  Schnitzel$LABEL$5
You don't see German restaurants very often and I'm glad I ran into this one for lunch. To begin$LABEL$5
We have lived in Charlotte for almost 4 years and always wanted to go to this place$LABEL$2
Although I use Yelp constantly$LABEL$4
We were in Charlotte visiting Carowinds and we were tired when we checked into our hotel. Plan A was to find a mid-level chain and bring take-out back to our room$LABEL$5
The young lady at the front desk was very professional to all customers even though some customers were not.  Incident taken on this date at 18:32 hours.$LABEL$4
Not our first visit and not our last. Great quality German food and beers. Spatzle red cabbage and schnitzels galore. I like the wurst platte and the wife loves Jagerschnitzel. Portions are not quite big enough to split unless you load up on soups and the fabulous pretzel bread.$LABEL$5
FREE 60-Day Membership - WARNING.  I got a coupon for a Free 60 day Membership from a Valpak mailing to my house.  My wife had me go there to claim the membership and get some Milk.  BJ's Customer Service informed me that I would have to buy a $40 dollar one year membership that I could get a refund up to one year.  They basically give you the first 60 days free$LABEL$1
60 day trail membership! Free! I tried Bj's out and it is great! I still like Costco better. Bj's doesn't have a big produce section. It is nice that they let you use manufacturers coupons!$LABEL$3

Slowest deli department in town. They have no sense of time so you know they don't value you yours. If they are attempting to push you to buy pre-packaged this is a novel and effective way to do so$LABEL$2
This Starbucks was my go-to when I used to work at Carolina Place Mall. The thing I love about this particular store is that it should be set up for failure. Terrible$LABEL$4
Clean and courteous location$LABEL$4
Now I love red lobster but this particular location pissssssed me off!!! It was packed as usual so the food took extra long. the waitress screwed up my bill at the end of the meal$LABEL$2
Great food and service. Very happy with my visit.$LABEL$5
\""Red Lobster is where America goes for seafood!\""I think that was their one-time slogan. This won't be the location I will go for their seafood$LABEL$2
I have been to many red lobsters before and usually enjoy the food. This was the first one that we have had to wait for a seat$LABEL$1
This has only been my 2nd time at a Red Lobster EVER. It was ok. I have had better seafood elsewhere. The biscuits were by far the star of the show. We were seated quickly for a Friday night and the server was fine.The seafood was a little undercooked and everything was dripping in butter. Don't get me wrong$LABEL$2
Red lobster was not the place to be tonight. Saturday-8/11!!!! The service was horrible. The waiter messed up so bad that we had more free food then we ordered. The appetizer came out after the salad. It seem to be over before it started. It only went down hill from here. I am done with this location. Come on red lobster!!!$LABEL$1
Its a Red Lobster!  Our waitress was awesome and we were here fore the 45 shrimp for $10 promo (im a fatty what do you want).  What better way to stuff your fat face with unlimited cheddar bay (my favorite bay in the whole world) biscuits and then top it off while trying to jam more shrimp down your gullet. The beer was a little flat$LABEL$3
We went to the Red Lobster at Carolina Place this past weekend. The quantity of the food was great; quality was adequate. Service was abysmal. Just as an example$LABEL$2
Terribly ran! We will never be back to this location. Food takes forever and it doesn't come out right. The wait staff is slow and management has no clue.$LABEL$1
We came here for a working lunch with 5 people. The service although she was very nice was slow. Our food was also timed very poorly with half of it coming out about 10 minutes before the other half. I got the shrimp kebabs with green beans and rice. The food was good$LABEL$3
My wife and her family took me here for my birthday$LABEL$2
WhAt. A  disapointment......we ordered a salmon plate$LABEL$1
will never go here again b/c for the 3rd time they messed up my to go order. they offered me a gift card one time but never got it. they tried to \""apoligize\"" but it was half harted in the apology. they claimed when i was there that all my order was in the bag and when i got home to check it was not. I will never got there again. they are to serve the customers and they are doing a poor job in doing that. they really don't care about the customers and they need to have the check in hand when they are putting the orders together.$LABEL$1
The lobster tail was salty. The crab legs were alright. The shrimp was awesome. The asparagus was amazing. All in all it was eh.$LABEL$2
I had my parents over for the weekend and my parents are like most and they are fairly weird. This time the weird discussion revolves around my father and his love of eating establishments in particular  Red Lobster.  I must admit I was biased and am one of those persons that considers Red Lobster the McDonalds of seafood so this would typically not be a place I would visit to eat. Surprisingly this visit was very good. I have a few horror stories of other Red Lobster's but this one end with everyone smiling and cheering. We drove to this restaurant in separate vehicles and the first thing I noticed is how far the handicap parking spaces are from the entrance. My parents park in those spaces and it was a hike for them to make it to the front door. I guess they want handicapped parking folks to get the most exercise  to build up for the meal. I am not sure of the planning or thoughts they have on parking. I am just thankful it was a beautiful day. Entering the restaurant and all the employees were kind and smiling. They sat us all within about 15 minutes. My father ordered his usual admiral feast$LABEL$3
this is just high priced captain D's. they quality has gone downhill over the past decade now I remember WHY I don't eat here.$LABEL$3
This is a solid location for Toys R Us$LABEL$3
The parking lot is dark and scary.  There were rusty carts strewn about.  Boxes and toys were all over the floor in the store.  I went twice in the past week and they had one register open with four other people doing nothing both times.  First cashier wasn't friendly but the most recent one was.  The prices were okay.  I had a Groupon for the first visit and 15% off for the second.  The store needs a major overhaul and some employees who care.$LABEL$2
I have been in this place several times and have had mixed experience. The service here is not so great. I had a question about a video game for my nephew and I felt like I was putting the clerk off by asking questions. The store was a bit disorganized$LABEL$2
Cheap & Cheerful. Jason's Deli is quick and easy. Order and pay when you walk in and they bring the food to your table. Lots of food choices and of course good deli food.The best part about Jason's Deli is the flaw in service. None of the staff notice all the freeloading. Now I have never freeloaded$LABEL$3
Not too crazy about this place. I ordered a pastrami on rye and it was just a pile of meat on soggy bread.$LABEL$2
Jason's Deli on Centrum Parkway is always busy at lunch.  I have always eaten at their salad bar$LABEL$2
Huge disappointment.I wanted a real deli sandwich (not Subway).  I thought I'd give this place a try.  $10.00 got me a 6\"" meatball sub on a white bun$LABEL$2
I had never been to a Jason's Deli before.  As I entered there is a large sign pointing where one should place a take out order$LABEL$3
Grub wise$LABEL$2
They know they were wrong for moving in next to Subway. I went over there because i glimpsed the subway sign & decided to go to Jason's instead. I can't be the only person to do this.Service was great & I enjoy the foursquare special. Good stuff.$LABEL$4
I took my order to go from Jason's deli and it was a quick non painful experience. I did see a worker named Jason go out of his way to help a family who spilled their drink on the table. It was nice to see someone caring about other people. I still think this place is over priced so I gave it 3 instead of 4 stars. The New York Yankee is pretty damn good.$LABEL$3
The restaurant was clean and the people working were friendly.  But$LABEL$2
Definitely not stingy on the meat! The hot corned beef and the baked potatoes are delicious .$LABEL$5
Ok$LABEL$3
Ok$LABEL$1
I have been to CMC-Pineville twice with my daughter and also a couple of times to accompany others who needed to visit the ER.On my first visit$LABEL$4
I've been going to this hospital long before it became part of the CMC system. The staff is great especially the nurses$LABEL$2
So here we are once again CMC$LABEL$3
(6/24/2013) Well its time for my 3 year check up to see what the state of my pituitary tumor is. For some unfathomable reason CMC-Pineville wanted me to show up an hour early at the main entrance. There is actually plenty of surface parking this early in the morning so that's a plus. The main waiting area is also empty.The MRI waiting room features the wide chairs. Some of the chairs have circular tables offset on their left arms.  The room is painted in muted blue and olive green. There is a 47\"" LG tv hung in the middle of the wall containing the check in window. There is also an alcove with a coffee maker & bottled water.I had been sitting behind a column & for some odd reason the tech didn't look into the entire room. I had to move nearer to the door and wait for her to come out again. The MRI is a GE model installed in 2006. Most MRI machines have their own noises that can actually be melodic. This machine actually made my body vibrate. It was strange.So far it was a five star experience but it was soon time to inject me with the radioactive contrast material. Things started going downhill after the MRI tech & another tech attempted to inject me with the material & instead collapsed my veins in both my arms. They next wanted to try my hands and I refused. I told them to butterfly it into a vein on a forearm. Their response was to stick the needle into my left wrist. The contrast was then pushed into the vein burning its way along. I will never have another MRI done there. Perhaps they knew that they wouldn't be getting excellent reviews of their service as I have not received any surveys to complete.$LABEL$2
My daughter was 7 months old and she has severe eczema she's been screaming and crying for hours and scratching her herself nonstop it's a bloody mess. One of the nurse was being kinda rude because I overheard the word morphine I called my husband to make sure that they are not giving my baby morphine. He asked to speak to the doctor I asked the nurse if she could speak to him she basically just brush me off saying \""I don't have time to talk to him \"" they got an IV on her and were about to give her doses of Benadryl$LABEL$1
Terrible treatment.  If you have an emergency do NOT come here.  They have the worst unprofessional staff that is completely unorganized$LABEL$1
There's plenty of gag gifts and oddities.  Spencers is aimed at the junior high kids and college freshmen gearing up for their spring break drunkapalooza at Myrtle Beach.There's some fun toys$LABEL$3
This is a fairly standard Home Depot$LABEL$3
Hello Friends$LABEL$3
Meh. It's a Home Depot that is no better and no worse than any other Home Depot I've been into. I was looking for one specific item in the plumbing department and their selection was only one and it didn't have the features I wanted. Oh well$LABEL$3
This location has awful reviews on Google. Just awful... I was nervous going in but I received better service here than at the one across town by Northlake. David's normally doesn't carry anything in my size but the ladies here heard me out and understood that I had spoken to the bride and had gotten the okay to get a dress other than the one she had registered us for. I really appreciate that none of them suggested that I \""eat more\"" or buy a dress that is too large and get it cut down - as though either of those are viable options. They took really good care of me$LABEL$4
Best way to put our experience there into words? Bipolar. We went for a prom dress. Poor customer service (other than the consultants who were great$LABEL$2
This is the second review I have done for this store and for this sales associate$LABEL$5
On my first appointment to buy my wedding dress and to find dresses for my 7 bridesmaids the attention was great and i was in love with the dresses. They promised so many things and made the whole situation sound great. Once my dress arrived and i went to pick it up the staff at the door was rude and they wanted me to sign the paper to pick up my dress without me looking at it first. Once i told them that i wasn't going to sign anything without inspecting my dress first$LABEL$1
There is no doubt that the ambiance is better than many other optical's shops but the prices are very high. We saw the same product in Carolina's mall in sears Optical's at a way lower price point. I am definitely disappointed.$LABEL$1
I wouldn't even give them one star at this location!! Beware Dr. Jeffrey Musler and Associates optometry group PA!!! This was the worst service and experience I have ever received!!! The ladies at the reception desk are horrible!!!! I called to order contacts and they were utterly confused. Miscommunication across the board. The receptionist said \""maybe\"" they'll go ahead and service me and they might call me back and hung up on me! I was simply trying to order contacts as the doctor told me it would be easy as calling in to do so. Terrible place and I would not recommend this facility to anyone.$LABEL$1
Booooo$LABEL$1
Where to begin my review as this will be my 1st and last review for this place.  I will definitely be sending a letter to the corporate office on this place. Upon entering for my families 1st time trying this spot for take out it would be our last.  I was in total shock seeing the cashier handling the register then placing lids on the tartar sauces used for the meals.  At no point was any washing of the hands or using gloves ever attempted$LABEL$1
Jackie the cashier fantastic!  She helped me choose my shrimp and fish meal which was pretty good.  But...husband's meal not so good. 1 piece of fish was fishy tasting$LABEL$3
Be careful when shopping here !  Bought an $8$LABEL$1
Though it is a chain$LABEL$4
I think this is one of the most fun places to eat in Charlotte$LABEL$4
First visit: We ordered a pizza from the menu on the wall. The ingredients were olives and tomatoes. When pizza came it was covered in onions$LABEL$1
It's been more than three years since my original review of Buca$LABEL$3
Family style with some coworkers$LABEL$3
I think this is a great place to go when you have a large number of people but it is expensive. We had chicken parm (very good)$LABEL$3
My husband and I ate at Buca di Beppo for lunch today for the first time.  Neither of us were impressed.  The staff was slow and somewhat unresponsive (even though it wasn't busy in the least)$LABEL$2
We haven't been here in over a year and it was time to return and see if there was any changes. First$LABEL$2
Let me start by saying their food is top notch$LABEL$2
12/26/11 7:45pm.I go to the hostess station and request seating for one.  Hostess asks if i wish to be seated at the bar$LABEL$1
Two and a half stars$LABEL$2
I  enjoyed the ambiance of Buca di Beppo at Universal City Walk in L.A. so I decided to book our Christmas Eve dinner at the more local to us Buca. The family had never been and I knew it would be fun. As you can imagine on Christmas Eve$LABEL$3
Just went here for dinner. Dinners are family style and leave your appetite satisfied. Small spaghetti order has 2fist sized meatballs and can feed 3 people easily . Friendly service. But divey on purpose. Supposed to look like Joe's basement in 1960's era NY or NJ . Food better than average$LABEL$3
The food here is okay (2.5 stars)and does not completely satisify your appetite. Every time we have eaten here$LABEL$2
Oh$LABEL$4
I have to give Buca di Beppo props on the ambiance they create.  You cannot find another restaurant like it (or if there is one - I am not aware of it).  For those that are not familiar with Buca di Beppo$LABEL$2
Good food and good service. Will definitely go back.$LABEL$5
...called at 6p to see if they would take reservations for that night. yes$LABEL$2
I hate to do this...I just hate to...but I have never experienced this before. I don't know if I can ever return to Buca. Firstly$LABEL$1
First of$LABEL$2
I've been to this restaurant twice and the food is amazing. Someone wrote here that the food tastes like it's either frozen or straight out of a can. I've had frozen italian and canned italian. The first thing you notice when eating at Buca is how FRESH the food tastes. Even the herbs in it seem quite fresh and complimentary.  someone also wrote that the atmosphere was loud and that they sang birthday songs a lot. Well to get around that my advice is to eat at home. This an italian restaurant. Nothing should be quiet about it! Enjoy the food$LABEL$5
This was our first visit. Cute kitschy place. Service was good- 4 stars.  Food was ok. Stuffed mushrooms- delish. I found it to be overpriced. Lasagna was slightly burned. Much better cold the next day. A granny apple salad was good but not $13.00 good.Bread was very plain. Would we return? Probably not.$LABEL$3
Came for Thanksgiving thought it would be nice for a change boy was I wrong made reservations 2 weeks ahead of time was supposed to get kitchen table didn't get it ! Then went to order gnocchi waiter brand new says they don't have ordered a Guinness beer says we have it be right back comes back like 15 minutes later to tell me they don't have.this place used to be good boy did it go down hill ! So disappointed !$LABEL$1
Originally left a bad reviw. Bur since then I was contacted by the district manager. You really seem to care about this restaurant's reputation. He said they're making improvements and that I should try it again. I told him I would and I will hold my review until I do that again. Everybody deserves a second chance.$LABEL$2
I wasn't as impressed with Buca as I wanted to be. I'd always thought this place looked a little cheesy  from the outside$LABEL$2
My son chose Buca for his birthday dinner.  There were 7 of us total and the toal bill was around $200.  No alcohol was ordered.  I was surprised how expensive it was.  The food was so-so.  I think the \""schtick\"" here is the family style entrees.  When you order spaghetti and meatballs$LABEL$3
They had 3 hostess up front doing nothing and didn't even greet us. Booked reservation for 17 and she tried to cram us on 3 tables. We had no space to move elbows. Why would you even try to seat us like that? Reason I book reservation is to have enough seats ahead of time. When I walk up front ask host if I can get a bigger table. She gave me an attitude. And was like \""sure\"". Never got a apology for cramming us into a small table. The place is a family style with big dishes. The way they had us seated we wouldn't been able too move to grab our food. Terrible customer service and it was my birthday. Disappointment. Will never return to the restaurant.$LABEL$1
After a good body massage me and my other 2 friends went to this place$LABEL$5
Love this place! Great food$LABEL$4
If the idea of awkwardly taking a tour of the kitchen followed by a maze through overrated Italian singers only to be led to a picnic table of the worst food ever... You are in for a good time.  DISGUSTING! Worst Italian food ever! They shouldn't even call it Italian food. It tastes like a frozen lean cuisine. The bread was even bad. Overpriced! Don't waste your time and money going here. This place really should receive a total of negative stars but yelp wouldn't let us post.   Sad$LABEL$1
I was less than impressed. The meatballs were greasy and very bland. The price was extremely high for food that was bland and not impressive. Based on the reviews I was excited to try$LABEL$1
Excellent southern Italian style dishes. Food is served family style so a small portion will feed two people. Avoid anything made with aioli as they do not do a good job with this.$LABEL$4
Booked on Open Table$LABEL$4
Went there on 10/22/14. Service was nice. Server was nice but so ditsy. Ordered bruschetta. Came out fast$LABEL$2
The food here is subpar$LABEL$2
Food was ok. It wasn't bad$LABEL$2

Unless you have no other choice do not shop here.  The store is horribly dirty and the prices are higher then Harris Teeter.  If you come after 10 you can hang out with the manager smoking outside (That's where he always is) or you can buy out of date bakery products.  If you question my review take a moment to go visit the men's bathroom.  It is disgusting and can be smelled 10 feet before you even get to the door.$LABEL$1
Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... But not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ...$LABEL$2
Close by grocery store ... Open 24 hrs - but count on it ... If you have a need for something specific - there's a good chance they will be out of it or have discontinued carrying it ... This place is not dependable for the real groceries... Go to Harris Teeter or Trader Joes for that ... This is good for creamer or milk or eggs ... Maybe ...  Also watch the cashiers - famous for over charges and not giving credit for coupons even after they're mentioned to them ... Most definitely pay attention to your charges !$LABEL$2
Kmart is the \""also-ran\"" of big box stores. I don't know any that have a large grocery section but they do have a decent selection of general merchandise$LABEL$3
The K (Big$LABEL$2
I wanted to bring some snacks back to Canada with me that we can't there. K-mart wouldn't be my first choice$LABEL$2
Always fast clean yummy and the manager dude is on point as far as high customer service. They messed my taco up. He smiled$LABEL$4
Seriously I waited in the drive thru for like 10 minutes. Finally I actually called the store and asked if there was a problem. The manager was like no why? So I explained that we had all been sitting there for forever and I was trapped in the drive thru and couldn't get out and could he please start taking orders. His response was oh sorry I accidentally turned my headset off go ahead with your order. (I was 3 cars away).  Anyways I got my usual cantina bowl and it was okay... not great even by Taco Bell standards.$LABEL$1
Coming to a US Taco Bell is always an interesting experience.First-off$LABEL$3
I'm stuck between TWO and THREE stars. After all it is Taco Bell. You can usually count on them for cheap and fast food. The cheap part is always standard. But$LABEL$2
i ordered a piece of furniture from havertys in April for Delivery in June.  When the piece was delivered it was damaged$LABEL$2
Ah yes...time again for some new living room furniture.  After getting new sofas every couple of years$LABEL$1
Gluten Free/Allergy Sensitive (menu on-line)It was clean and the service was good but$LABEL$2
Maybe I'm spoiled by the Longhorn near my house$LABEL$2
C'mon folks$LABEL$2
i used to work at this location in high school - back then it was great food and a fun atmosphere. Things have really slipped since then though. They drowned my salad in ranch dressing and cheese....  I thought it was supposed to be a healthy dish (?)....My sweet tea wasn't sweet at all$LABEL$2
We like Longhorn$LABEL$1
I wouldn't be so quick to hand out only one star$LABEL$1
Let me preface this by saying I only came here because I was given a gift card. After reading the reviews I was less than excited$LABEL$1
GREAT steaks$LABEL$5
The only reason I went with my wife was because their management sent me a gift card as a sorry note because one of their waiting staff mistreated us at another restaurant location.Really convenient location right next to the mall$LABEL$3
The restaurant and corporate did follow up with me. They sent a letter of apology$LABEL$3
My son and I dined here recently.  He's a steak fan and I was looking for something he would eat!  My son ordered a Rib eye (standard) and I ordered the Parmesan Encrusted Chicken w/ a sweet potato and veggies.Our meal was prepared well and it didn't take very long.  My son's steak was cooked properly and since he \""woofed\"" it down$LABEL$4
Absolutely wonderful service and the Half Shredded Prime Rib Sandwich and Loaded (and I do mean loaded) potato soup is stupendous$LABEL$4
This used to be my favorite steak house in Charlotte.  It's really gone downhill lately.  The last 2 times I've eaten here the prime rib was still cold.  I told the waiter to take it back and cook it some more.  He brought it back STILL COLD.  I realize prime rib is best rare$LABEL$2
The meal was good.  The usual$LABEL$1
They get two for the great service but everything else was not so good. I had a ribeye which was cooked to the right temperature. It was seasoned with a TON of salt and a pound of butter. Sweet potato also had too much butter. My gf got the lobster chops the lobster was overcooked and tough to get out of the shell. It should be easy when it comes split already right? Her corn on the cob was undercooked. So all in all the service is good but the food sucks. We will not be coming back again.$LABEL$2
We got here a little before 5 PM hoping to beat the crowd and not have to wait to be seated-The place was empty except for the 5 or 6 parties ahead of us in the waiting area who made the same mistake-We were expected to happily wait until 5 when more servers would start work-We left.Don't pretend to be open and not be ready to serve hungry customers!I like the food here and think it's a pretty good value for the $60 or so we spend for the two of us$LABEL$2
The meal was Filet$LABEL$2
Being apart of  the Darden company I knew what to expect which was great service. My family received just that. Ashley was our server and she was awesome. Our food was nice and hot and was on time. Thank you Longhorn family!!!$LABEL$5
9/7/2014 Went here for late lunch with a friend after running errands near the mall. I've been here at this location a few times before with great results. Today not so much. Our server Jeff was the worst waitstaff I've encountered in many years.could never find him$LABEL$2
Omgoodness! Went with the other reviews and tried Genaro's. This was some of the best food ever and we eat out a lot$LABEL$5
very nice store. the selections are fairly good for all types of animals. they at ban field vets have a traveling aviary doctor which was a little inconvenient seeing as I needed one that day.the bird toys are slim for large birds. the bird foods and treats selections is very good. I like the dog treat section also they have a much better variety than the average grocery store or wal mart. one of my dogs is a 10 year old chihuahua who weighs 3lbs she is no bigger than a can of soda with legs and has very few teeth. the training rewards treats are perfect for her tiny mouth and soft enough for her to chew.I have walked around the store some and all areas have a good variety to choose from no matter what you are looking for. I love that I can take my animals in the store. the staff has always been very attentive and friendly$LABEL$4
Big box pet supply store$LABEL$3
This is a chain and should be thought of as such! Not the best I have every had but$LABEL$3
A strip-mall chain.  It's not bad food$LABEL$3
I would not recommend going to this Best Buy location. I recently purchased a big screen tv there and had the worst experience a consumer could have. I originally found a tv at their Rivergate location and they did not have any in stock so I went to Pinevill. When I arrived I was one of maybe four people in the store and no one would assist me. After waiting for twenty minutes I went to customer service where I waited another five minutes. Then customer service wouldnt help me. I knew the tv$LABEL$1
This is a good size BestBuy store in the area.  Normally I go to the one in Matthews that was the former circuit city location and it is a bit tighter.  I did notice that I did not get greeted by the security guy at the front as I normally do in Matthews - but that's a trivial part of the shopping experience [but I did notice it].The guy manning the video game aisles was pretty knowledgeable and answered my questions well.  We also ended up spending a lot of time playing around with the Kinect demo in the store since my cousin could not make up his mind to make a big purchase or not.  I am the same way$LABEL$3
Best Buy big box. Best display of electronics and appliances possible$LABEL$3
Absolutely horrible customer service!  The worst Best Buy I have ever visited.  My family shops at Best Buy from Wilmington to Johnson City and this is by far the worst place we have ever been.  I don't usually write these but they irratated me to no end not once$LABEL$1
Finding myself in need of a wireless router soon (going from AT&T U-Verse back to TWC because of moving - AT&T supplies wireless router$LABEL$4
Good service here. I was greeted upon entering and thanked when exiting. I wanted to see what the deal was with the Samsung Gear. The sales associate in the department was knowledgeable about the product and could answer my questions.$LABEL$3
Bought an item from there$LABEL$1
Waiting in line no one here....3 employees standing around and no one says anything. Horrible service. Next time ill just order on amazon$LABEL$1
I came here for the first time and was so happy they could customize my bagel to be healthy by making it skinny (cutting a chunk out of the middle making it thinner) and using egg whites.  It was warm$LABEL$5
I have mixed feelings about Bruegger's but I still keep coming back here$LABEL$3
Brueggers Bagels when hot and fresh the bagel are good. I don't like the fact that they ask if you want the bagel toasted that is already hot or warm. Being from Jersey this is not a question asked in the early morning hours by any of the bagel shops. They really rip you off with their drink prices so grab a water at the gas station and save a buck.$LABEL$3
Cream cheese skimp alert!! We pay ~$7 per smoked salmon bagel and they put the cream cheese on like people butter their toast. They have no clue what the word \""toasted\"" means. It really is just warming the bagel. The lox bagels are not even made open face. Not going back again.$LABEL$1
Admittedly$LABEL$5
I recently moved to Charlotte and I was looking for a nail salon to get a mani and pedi. I'm so happy I stopped at Lefi. I loved$LABEL$5
I used to come here and eat the big slices of Sbarro pizza in the food court and just people watch.  Although I am not much of a mall person$LABEL$3
I used to go shopping here quite often with the parentals$LABEL$3
I was pleasantly surprised with this mall. It's nicely decorated and has a spacious layout. Most of the mainline stores are here. It was very clean inside too.I didn't spend much time here and I don't live nearby. It seems nice and I'd be happy to come here again when in the neighborhood!$LABEL$4
Probably not my first choice in malls$LABEL$3
The only really bad thing about Carolina Place is the location.  It is not anywhere near where my normal routine takes me$LABEL$3
Not the best or the worst mall in Charlotte. I'm the in and out type of guy - go straight to correct store$LABEL$2
I only venture over to Carolina Place when I have gift cards for JC Penny and now that they've done away with all the good sales on kids clothing it's really not even worth the trip since the other stores are just regular mall stores.  Nothing special about Carolina Place unless you live close by$LABEL$3
ALERT TO PARENTS AND SHOPPERS OF CAROLINA PLACE MALL:  One of the employees of the massage parlor (Oasis) next to the kid's play area was caught inconspicuously taking pictures of my 4 yr. old daughter while she was playing there.  Even though it is private property$LABEL$1
I remember when this mall first opened and it was AWESOME.  Throughout the years it has gone a bit downhill$LABEL$3
Carolina Place is a great drive from my house and the proximity is something that makes it stand out. It's not an upscale mall like South Park by any means$LABEL$4
Just your typical mall.  Nothing out of the ordinary.  It was kept pretty clean as well and had a large amount of parking.$LABEL$3
This is an interesting mall for me. From the outside it looks nice. The grounds are well kept and everything seems to be in good repair. Same with the interior.The first thing I don't get here is that there are FIVE department stores here. For whatever reason Americans love their department stores I guess. You don't see malls in Canada with more than two department stores and even then Sears is struggling.The other thing about this mall that is odd is that the large majority of clothing stores located here are sportswear stores. If you were blindfolded and taken here you would think Charlotte is full of people who only wear hoodies$LABEL$3
Santa Claus here sucks!  They wouldn't even give us a couple minutes to settle our child down.  They just shooed us along and wouldn't even try to help calm our kid down.  How disappointing it is that these people are charging an arm and leg for these pictures but will not even attempt to settle a child down or get them acclimated to a stranger with a long beard! I will not be back to see year people again!I$LABEL$1
Gave this mall yet another try again today$LABEL$1
Nice clean mall inside and out.Food court is lacking in options. If you don't work at the mall you wouldn't eat at the mall. Good store options available but could use different variety...lots of sports ones.Hair cutters places?Good location easy to get in and out with lots of directions.$LABEL$3
First time visiting this mall and it definitely has a good spread of shopping and food. We weren't on a mission to purchase anything so we were just walking around but it was clean$LABEL$5
Service sets the tone for a meal! It has been my experience that even when the food is ok$LABEL$2
I'm not a fan but I enjoy drinking at the bar area. So if you're coming to drink ... not so bad. If you're coming to eat ...  ah you might think again!$LABEL$2
Had great service until we got our food. Took one bit into my pasta and a brillo pad was on my fork!!!! I was disgusted. I asked to speck to the manger and she told me \"" it's acceptable for these kinds of things to happen in restaurants\"". I will not be going to any restaurant if Brillo pads are going To end up in my food. Yes I know sometimes things could land I'm my food. I.e hair but a Brillo pad is something that can't go unseen. I contacted Applebee's human resources and they were great. No complaints there$LABEL$2
Good service$LABEL$3
Dillard's is pretty nice but their decor seem a bit outdated though$LABEL$3
We decided to start our wedding band search for both Kevin and me and this was the first jeweler we stopped at.  Gary approached us asking what we were looking for$LABEL$2
I went in here to get my engagement ring resized.  I was so upset on the possibility of giving my ring over to strangers and the possibility of not seeing it for a while!  The staff was wonderful$LABEL$2
I've been to a number of Olive Gardens across the country and this one by far has me most unimpressed of all. Our server$LABEL$1
In some cities (Detroit for example)$LABEL$4
Went here becuase my in-laws wanted to try it out. Not a big fan of Olive Garden but you can't go wrong with their food. We went on a weekend so it was busy. The table they sat us at$LABEL$1
The minute you step into this OG$LABEL$2
You know what Olive Garden is and so do I.  Despite being far from authentic$LABEL$2
Most people are aware that OG is far far from authentic...however it seems that OG has gone downhill in recent years$LABEL$1
Came here for lunch with my pops$LABEL$2
Oh Olive Garden...you really impressed me with your new menu options and I'm very happy to write this review!It had been a while since I've visited and OG$LABEL$4
I do agree with most of the reviews that OG isn't in my top 10 places that I care to dine.  As this location is directly in front of Carolina Place mall (right next to a Red Lobster)$LABEL$3
I love this place because the pasta is always very very very hot.$LABEL$5
Let me start off by premising the fact that I was at the mall$LABEL$2
Until recently$LABEL$1
Went here on Sunday. We don't usually go to chain restaurants$LABEL$2
This is probably one of the worst Olive Garden I have been to. I am a frequent diner at Olive Garden$LABEL$2
i know$LABEL$2
It is amazing how this restaurant always has long wait times when I honesty don't believe that the food is great. I have gone a couple of times and each time that I have gone I have gotten different dishes. I feel like the food is not flavorful and are always missing something. You can definitely find better chain Italian restaurants like Maggiano's or Bravo! Come here if you like bland dishes.$LABEL$2
This place was disgusting!!! I ate here yesterday around 6. I usually love Olive Garden but the last 2times I've been here was nasty. The outside is dirty$LABEL$1
It's Olive Garden... So of course I'm not going to give 4-5 stars. Friendly service$LABEL$3
--LOOK AT MY PICTURE!!! This is a picture of an **INSECT that I was about to eat!! I was really hungry and decide to stop by and eat.. Thank goodness this was my second plate and I wasn't too full because I gulped down the first plate.. This is your soup of toscana that I was served. Management provided a friendly compensation$LABEL$1
The food today was all good ..we had chicken Alfredo$LABEL$3
Smells like wet dog.  EXTREMELY humid inside.   Food was good (the two stars worth).  Service was very bad today.  I am a server myself and I would be beyond embarrassed if I provided such poor service to a table.  Added bonus - It constantly seemed like she was trying to rush us out.  Delivered our desert in a to go container without us even asking!!!  Also delivered our checks before we were halfway done and we had to ask to have a desert added on...$LABEL$2
Everything pasta ! BuonAppetito ! So our first impression was we would be here awhile since parking was full. Surprisingly enough we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Our sever was prompt and informative and our first course arrived on our table less than 8 minutes from the time we ordered it! The salad had only one complaint and it seems to be a consistent issue with this restaurant - one that really doesn't make sense to me - olives ! There are two olives in the large bowl of salad ... If you want more than two olives$LABEL$5
I'm always perplexed about coming to this restaurant. It's not like I don't know what the foods going to taste like$LABEL$3
Ate lunch here. Was good!  Service was friendly$LABEL$3
If you stay at the Hilton garden inn$LABEL$3
Currently here at the restaurant. It's noisy$LABEL$2
Wow! The tenderloin medallions were out of this world! Full if flavor and choice of topping. The service was fantastic as well. I have no complaints here.$LABEL$5
I Had a great steak$LABEL$4
So far really slow food service . Took over half an hour to get main entree after getting the drinks and appetizer.  Server was good$LABEL$2
I had been a fan of TR for years. Saturday was my first time back and I was dissapointed in the changes. The menu had changed greatly. They took away all the samplers of different ribs and the portions are much smaller. The price has gone up alot also. The ribs taste good but for the price it's just not worth me going back. I heard they were having a tough time thru the county but the changes made I don't believe will make them better.$LABEL$2
I received a free entree coupon for my birthday from Tony Roma's$LABEL$1

While I normally don't review auto repair places$LABEL$5
I stopped in to get a serpentine belt replaced that I had in hand.  It broke on my lunch hour so I went to AutoZone and bought one.  I how long it would be to get to it and how long it would take.  They said they could get to it \""right now\"" and it shouldn't take long.  30 minutes later they pulled it in the shop.  1 hour later it was completed.  They tried to charge me $212 for 2 hours of labor.  I asked how could it take 2 hours when it was only the shop for 1 hour and I was there for 1.5 hours.  They then corrected it and charged me a flat fee of $99.07.  If this is their generic price for 1 hour of labor it is ridiculous.  It shouldn't have take an hour to do it anyway.  This is the first and last time I will visit here.  They also pulled my car in front and left it running while the bill was being discussed.  I am very unhappy with their service and will let everyone I come in contact with.Update.  The owner called me to apologize. He asked me to call back and get a full refund.  He also had a free oil change put on my account.  I called to get the refund.  I probably won't be back.  It's not convienent for me.  I only stopped because I needed ta repair that day and they were close.This occured on 9/27/2011.$LABEL$1
I have been servicing my car here for a year$LABEL$5
I wish it were possible to give a business 0 stars because this auto repair facility committed several cardinal sins today and are not trustworthy. (Background: I am a young female who has had plenty of trouble with being treated unfairly in the auto repair world. It is my pet peeve. It is wrong. And you - mechanics - should feel ashamed for taking advantage of women car owners because you think you can.)I went to Treadquarters today for help after I noticed a screw had punctured my tire earlier this morning. The tire wasn't deflated yet and the screw was deeply embedded in the tread. I needed a patch so I could go on about my day. When I looked Treadquarters up online they were advertising \""Free Tire Repair\"" with some exclusions$LABEL$1
I went in Treadquarters Pineville 3 weeks ago to get a patch on my tire. Today I was washing my car I noticed a big scratch on my wheel that went the entire way around. In the past I worked at a custom wheel and tire shop and know that the only thing that will cause this type of damage is if the technician does not pull the wheel weight off the wheel when he dismounts or installs the tire after a repair. Now everybody makes mistakes but back at the tire shop I worked at if the technician made a mistake and caused any kind of damage he would inform the customer. This was not the case at Tread Quarters Pineville. When I went back to Treadquarters to show them the damage$LABEL$1
The breakfast here is really good however their lunch could use some work. A lot of the vegetables are watered down and don't have much flavor. I would recommend trying this place on a Tuesday when they serve their baked chicken. It's really good.$LABEL$3
I don't like to give out one stars and I don't give them out lightly without an explanation. I was out driving looking for yard sales in the area when we passed this cute little restaurant. I figured it was probably going to be some amazing southern cooking and my heart was craving some delicious buttered pancakes. To my dismay they were done with breakfast once we arrived. Ah well. No big deal.We sat at our table and it took a bit for our server to come and talk to us$LABEL$1
Cheap$LABEL$4
My dog hates animals$LABEL$4
I was a bit skeptical about boarding my dog since I take him wherever I go but I heard rave reviews this place. That being said$LABEL$5
I recently went out of town for 4 days and decided to try Best Friends Pet Care.  The staff was pretty friendly and the whole boarding process was pretty simple and fast.  My major gripe is when I picked up my two dogs four days later$LABEL$2
These guys are great!!!My boyfriend took his dog here the other day and they took him without an appointment with no hassles! They did a great job and we got our baby back in a reasonable time! We will be back.$LABEL$4
This place had availability as we were calling everyone$LABEL$1
I took my dog here to be boarded.  He came home unhappy$LABEL$1
Best friends pet care has been the only place I know my golden retriever will receive the same care and love that I give to him. My coop has been coming here for four years and he acts like every day is his first$LABEL$5
I boarded my dogs here and spent thousands of dollars with this place because of our travel schedule. I  lost a lot of money with my business and couldn't afford to get my dogs. When we called they said no payment$LABEL$1
Review #1500!I had to wait a while to write this review because this is where I ended up buying my fiancee's engagement ring.I was in town for some training and staying at a hotel down the street so I thought I would check out what the US jewelry stores had to offer. After a couple minutes of browsing I was greeted and asked what I was looking for. She gave me a rundown of the basics about the store and their offerings of engagement rings. Then we got right into it. My fiancee had been pinning designs that she liked so I pulled up that list to help narrow things down. Once we had gone through all of the display cases I narrowed it down to four rings. We skipped past the pitch about diamonds as I had already heard it many times at other jewelry stores. Finally I grabbed all of the information on the four rings to be pleasantly surprised that the one I liked the best and the one I thought my fiancee would like was significantly discounted because it had been discontinued. I went back to my hotel to upload the options to the fiancee's Pinterest board and to do some research. After poking around on different websites and asking some sneaky questions to my fiancee I decided to go back and purchase the Neil Lane ring that had been discontinued. It turns out that there was almost the exact same ring still in production which was full price so I knew I'd be kicking myself later if I didn't snag this deal.Upon returning to the store a few hours later$LABEL$4
Quickly losing stars. Nickle and dime you. Not a fan.Hubs went shopping for some sparkle and shine for me. He did very well! He mentioned that once he picked out the earrings he was told that there is an extra charge for the earring posts. What?! How do the posts not come with the earrings (especially when you throw down a lot of Benjamins to begin with)? That is just crazy. Next$LABEL$2
This is a review of their business practices online.  Essentially$LABEL$1
Will never go back. Was there 2 hours before closing for an oil change and was turned away because they did not have enough time.  I gladly took my business elsewhere.$LABEL$1
Brought my girlfriends car in this morning to get a NC state inspection. I was greeted by Brian who was extremely friendly and helpful. He got me in and out of there in a half hour and gave me some good advice on my car and what needs to be serviced soon. I would recommend precision auto tune in pineville$LABEL$5
Slow$LABEL$1
Usually a bit pricey for me but ordered the Farmhouse salad with roasted turkey and lt. Italian dressing at $4.99. Let me tell you that is a delicious salad and under 300 cal. with light dressing; can't go wrong. A bit slow getting it but that's due to them making it fresh.$LABEL$3
There's a reason no one goes here. Service is horrible. Even with only 1 other person in the store the staff acts like their overwhelmed. How this location is still in business is some type of weird paradox. Don't bother to stop. You have been warned.$LABEL$1
One of the bigger and better Chinese feed troughs in the area.  Like so many others$LABEL$3
Blech.  I think I must have been at a different buffet than these other reviewers$LABEL$2
Ugh...don't waste your time or your money!  I would have given it zero stars but the Mei Fun and the Pepsi were actually decent.  The buffet has the typical Chinese fair but the only thing I could come close to suggesting would be the fried shrimp$LABEL$1
A pretty standard Chinese buffet.  The have a nice seafood selection$LABEL$3
I've been coming to China Buffet for approximately 10 years now. When I first moved to Pineville in 2001 this was just somewhere close to eat cheaply. At that time they did not have the sushi chef.The Chinese Buffet:Nothing to write home about. Nothing here is truly worth mentioning. Just your standard Chinese buffet fare mostly covered i thick$LABEL$3
Very large buffet. They have sushi$LABEL$4
Not very good. Dried out food. Some things cold$LABEL$1
We have always left most Chinese buffets feeling all bloated with all the sodium but we did not have that problem here. Other than that it is your typical Chinese buffet. Good flavor with plenty to select from. Could have been a little cleaner but I see with the amount of people there that it would be hard to keep up with especially with all the kids. All in all it was good and we would go back.$LABEL$3
This place is absolutely filthy. We were here last year and we decided never to go back but we thought we'd give it another try. Went for dinner tonight and was disgusted. There was old dried up rice under the tables against the wall just piled up. Wet napkins were wedged under our booth seats. Under the buffet lights$LABEL$1
Avoid this place.  Food was decent$LABEL$2
Great sushi ! Not so great waitress staff . Mostly cold expressions and unfriendly  attitudes . The sushi chefs are great ! Very friendly and always accommodating.  This is a great place to eat if you know how to pick and choose food - otherwise you may be very disappointed - soup is good - fruit is good and all you can eat sushi for 10.00 is definitely worth it - don't count on waitress to factor into the experience...You'll do fine . They will stand in your way- step out in front of you - and overall just stare like you are their enemy until time for the check$LABEL$3
The sushi is great but the food on the bar is very average to below in my opinion. We very rarely come but sometimes brave the little food choice for some sushi. Tips:ask Tony at the sushi bar for a crazy roll! If you like egg drop soup you will want to skip it here$LABEL$3
I didn't find the Chinese buffet all that$LABEL$4
Did not like it. Luke warm food that was not appetizing or tasteful. Not the cleanest establishment.$LABEL$2
I am usually reluctant to complain$LABEL$1
Stay Away!  They damaged my car. If I were you I would not risk taking my car or any other vehicle to auto bell.$LABEL$1
I started going here when I purchased a Living Social for some oil changes$LABEL$5
Stay away from this AAMCO! They have the worst customer service EVER! We purchased a Groupon to have our tires rotated and a fuel injection service performed$LABEL$1
Stayed here for 2 nights in the whirlpool suite. We paid in advanced so we received an additional $20 a night savings. Location is surrounded by several stores and restaurants. Hotel is very clean & plenty of things to do here to make your stay enjoyable. At $99 a night for a whirlpool suite$LABEL$3
I'm definitely a fan of the Hilton Garden Inn.  This is my 2nd time staying at Hilton Garden Inn (not this specific one).  Both experiences were great.  The room here was clean$LABEL$4
This is the only place I take my vehicles to get inspected.  This is all they do- inspections. They do not do oil$LABEL$4
I've taken my car here at least twice. Both times it failed on a defective license bulb.Not the biggest problem in the world of maintenance but they charged me $8 to screw it in.If you get your car tested here$LABEL$2
This is not my favorite place to get my car inspected. It is certainly not that clean$LABEL$3
Just left there and my car was inspected quickly and no hidden costs.  The staff was efficient and quick and that's all I can ask.$LABEL$5
My vehicle was failed state inspection because of a claim I was missing specific emission equipment. So I went to the dealership to pickup the missing parts and the dealership informed me that my vehicle has never had the emissions parts in question.$LABEL$1
I used to only take both my vehicles here when it was buffalo Tire$LABEL$1
If I could give 0 stars for this business I would!  Was totally ripped off!!!Took my car in to have NC Inspection.  While waiting$LABEL$1
I have never actually been there in person$LABEL$5
IHOP is IHOP... it's great for it's consistency wherever you go.  Usually when I hit up IHOP it's on the weekends and you end up fighting the crowds$LABEL$3
My son and I love going to IHOP for breakfast. Well this was our first attempt at this location and it was below expectations. The restaurant had about 10 tables empty and we still had to wait 20 mins to be seated. My guess is they were understaffed. Once we did get seated$LABEL$2
My wife and I had great service from Spring when we ate here a few nights ago. We always ask for either her or Tiffany. Unfortunately the steak tips and eggs that I ordered for dinner were foul. The steak was either overcooked or it was bordering on raw. Thank Gods for the fluffy buttermilk pancakes & hot maple syrup. Without them I'd have gone hungry that night.You might wonder why we continue to eat there given the plethora or marginal experiences$LABEL$2
My wife & I were back at iHop in Pineville this evening. The restaurant was pretty empty. The manager told us that it was very full a couple hours ago because Tuesday night is kids eat free night. My wife had chicken & waffles & I had a new menu item the chicken fajita quesadilla with a side of onion rings. My wife inhaled her meal. I worked my way through mine. Ihop makes really good onion rings so it was a treat to eat there tonight.$LABEL$3
Tonight we're seated close to the kitchen. There's a bunch of adult children seated around us. Bob is the manager tonight and Spring is our server. Matt is also serving tonight. He's as dour as he normally is. I ordered a sweet tea while my wife ordered a pepsi. I'm using a birthday coupon for a free entree for chocolate chip pancakes. Spring brought me an ice cream sundae on the house! She said they would sing happy birthday to me but I told them not to bother. The food was good. We had a good time.$LABEL$3
Matt is our server tonight. I ordered a Bacon cheeseburger and a sweet tea with onion rings as the side. My wire ordered some breakfast thing. There are five people in here including us. We'd hoped for more dinner theater$LABEL$3
Even though the place is almost empty there are still enough people to watch. I'm going to order the all you can eat pancakes. My wife ordered wings and a house salad. Apparently 7pm is the dinner hour for older Charlotteans. The front of the restaurant was almost full. Service was slow but there were only two servers Matt & Tiffany. Tracey was the night manager. We go there to hang out & kill a few hours so slow service doesn't matter really to us anymore. The thing I really hate is the way that the food is presented. It looks nothing like it does on the menu.$LABEL$3
The service was very friendly$LABEL$2
My wife asked me if I wanted to go to iHop tonight and naturally I said yes. I have to protect my dukedom. I ordered the country sausage potatoes$LABEL$2
I'm trying the chicken tortilla soup and the French onion pot roast. I can safely say that I will never order either again. The soup was steaming hot and its primary flavor was salt. The pot roast by comparison had no flavor whatsoever. It was tender but the mushrooms and carmelized onions were not in evidence. To make matters worse the corn was flavorless and the mashed potatoes had no butter. Tiffany failed as our server tonight but Tracey stepped up and refreshed our drinks and brought me melted butter and grilled onions.$LABEL$2
For an IHOP$LABEL$4
This place is empty tonight. Spring is the only server. Tiffany is here too but she looks terrible. I ordered the 3 eggs$LABEL$3
Okay$LABEL$2
Cedric is our server. A nice polite young man. I ordered a breakfast sampler. The restaurant is absolutely packed this morning. The food was hot & delivered promptly. Cedric was a great server I'd be happy to have him serve us again.$LABEL$4
I ordered the ultimate bacon and sausage platter with all you can eat pancakes. Spring is our server. The restaurant was pretty empty when we got there but slowly started to attract people as we ate. I suppose that most people don't see IHop as a Mother's Day destination which was good because it was very easy to get a table. The food would't win any awards but it hit the spot & the dinner show was always good.$LABEL$3
(5/24/13) Spring is our server this evening.  I ordered a cheeseburger and a side of onion rings. It was good. My wife ordered chicken tenders. The food was good but average. We mainly go to iHop to people watch & hang out with the staff. All in all a good evening.$LABEL$3
(9-14-13) Had a new server Nikki this evening. Spring  & Tiffany left this location. Only Matt & Cindy remain from the old crew. The food was good. I had a cheese burger & onion rings with sweet tea.(10-3-13) We once again dined at Ihop. I had a one year anniversary certificate from the online Ihop club. I got an omelet & pumpkin pancakes. Matt was our server & the food was great!$LABEL$4
I ordered the all you can eat pancakes and four sausage links. Coty is our server though Matt & Cindy are here too. Everything was fine. It definitely was better than Waffle House.$LABEL$3
It's IHOP. I'm still alive. Food is good. Large selection of food from breakfast (Crazy huge omelets!) to dinner. Sometimes hard to make a quick decision.$LABEL$3
So I'm having the bacon and white cheddar melt on artisan sourdough bread and it's amazing! The most amazing thing about it is that it has no distinct taste other than the eggs. The seasoned fries are seasoned with salt I believe. They taste good. The grilled sourdough bread has the strangest scent. It reminds me of freshly drying paint.My wife ordered the new quesadillas. She's fully consumed one with no snide comments flying so it must be good.$LABEL$3
Michelle is our server this evening.  I ordered a mushroom spinach burger with fries and an unsweetened tea. Unsurprisingly nothing had any flavor. The service was pretty bad as well. A shame really$LABEL$3
Food was very salty. I think I'm bout to have a heart attack. God took too long to come out and half our order was forgotten. Anyhoo I was so hungry I ignored the salty food and scarfed it down. There seasonal fruit contained 3 canned pineapples and 2 canned grapes.$LABEL$2
Hatoya is awesome!  They have everything$LABEL$5
I've enjoyed eating at El Veracruz for lunch and drinks after work.  It took me almost a year to realize that it was an old Hardee's that they slapped a patio on and turned into a Mexican restaurant.I defiantly enjoy the outdoor patio. They are constantly making improvements to it.  It's one of the rare places in the area where you can actually sit outside.The food is good and the portions are plentiful.  The service is always great.$LABEL$4
Very fast and nice service. The menu is a bit overwhelming$LABEL$4
\""Experienced better\"" per the two stars? Not really. They're all the same. This was my second time here. Second time after my other engine oil changer shop annoyed me for the last time$LABEL$2
First time customer 5/10/213. They are not very through. Went in for an inspection and failed due a broken passenger mirror and weak wipers. I repaired the mirror at another location and they noticed my belts were split and cracking very badly. If it was not for the mirrors$LABEL$1
Our country club recently hired the building company to install a rather large deck. After it was installed$LABEL$1
The Pineville Ice House is kinda crappy. There is no lobby. You walk in and you're in the ice rink$LABEL$2
I don't have much experience with ice rinks$LABEL$3
You may have heard recently that curling is all the rage since the Winter Olympics came through.  Some call it \""chess on ice\$LABEL$4
The Pineville Icehouse is geared for hockey only.  The public skate times are too short and too expensive.  I tried renting skates$LABEL$1
Let me first start off by letting everyone know I'm originally from Minnesota. The Ice House is a fairly average rink that maintains their ice well. The ice makes all the difference in my opinion.While the skate sharpening may be better than the \""other\"" Charlotte rink (which is incredibly important if you're renting skates)$LABEL$3
With a good low rate of $7.50 for entry and $2.50 for skate rental this is arguably the best option for a first-time ice skater in the Charlotte area. The Pineville Ice House$LABEL$4
The Winter Olympics inspired us to hit the ice rink. I'm no Michelle Kwan but I've been on the ice a time or two. This rink just didn't blow my mind. We arrived right when the open skate time started (check their website for the schedule). The entry process is pretty simple. Walk to the building$LABEL$2

I have lived all over the US and even globally and I can honestly say that in my opinion FairPoint is the WORST telephone company I have ever dealt with. I moved in 11/2009 and they are still holding my credit balance refund hostage. When I called to request information$LABEL$1
If there were a \""zero stars\"" rating$LABEL$1
My 97 year old mother who is blind moved from one room to another and the company said it would take a week to change the phone because it was a holiday.  After the week was up they said the work order was extended a month because they had so much new business.   I escalated the issue.   The said they would get back to me within 48 hours.  No response.  Some company!$LABEL$1
The Spa at Ballantyne Hotel is a full-service day spa that offers massages$LABEL$4
I was so surprised as to the level of disappointment I experienced at this spa. My best friend and I (she flew in from NJ for a visit and we planned a girls' day) went to this spa for 1 hour massages$LABEL$1
UPDATE: I mailed a letter to the spa director with our list of complaints. I was surprised when I received a phone call from the director. He wanted to discuss our experience and promised that they were in a transition$LABEL$1
Update # 3...OK we went for our 'great experience'. It was ok. Massages themselves were good-to-great. Nothing else was improved. No follow-up from the manager considering the situation. I promise you that you can find something better to do with $175.$LABEL$2
I fianc\u00e9 gave me a gift card here for my birthday. I was so excited because I work for a salon and spa so I was wanting to get pampered. I received a body wrap$LABEL$1
It takes a lot for me to give a nasty review$LABEL$1
Over crowded$LABEL$1
I made a reservations for my bf and i at the spa on 6/14/14 to have a relaxing Day but they gave me a stressful week. It was a really nice place. i was planning to go again but not anymore.I was very disappointed when i found out that i got charged twice and got 2 overdraft fees because of the spa and the amount was  different compared to the first time being charged also my bf got charged and it was a different amount too. I think this was fraud because they charged our cards different amounts without our authorization. I received a refund a week later from the spa after several disputes.$LABEL$1
WOW. What a nice hotel for the price.  The breakfast area was great with oatmeal$LABEL$5
Pretty classy Hampton Inn. The overall decor and amenities are nice. The rooms are big and clean and comfy. The desks$LABEL$4
As you pull down the promenade and approaching the hotel$LABEL$4
This is a fantastic$LABEL$4
Not bad if you're stuck on the out skirts of town$LABEL$3
I've stayed at 3 Marriott properties this week and this is both the worst of the 3$LABEL$2
They took my room number and made a 9 am shuttle appt when I checked in. I come down at 9:00 and the shuttle had already left. Front desk called shuttle and they \""were already at the airport\"". Why make an appt in the first place if you weren't going to keep it? Why take down my room number if you weren't going to call me? So much for. Being a platinum member. Skip these clowns$LABEL$1
We love Marriott's and this Courtyard was good.  Yes$LABEL$3
Worst service in a Marriot.  My key did not work$LABEL$1
Nice room and staff but the point of staying here is its proximity to the airport and that was the flaw in my stay. I had a 7:30 am flight so I wanted to get to the airport around 6:30. They had a 6:00 and 6:30 shuttle and they said it was a five minute drive. So I chose 6:30. I chose poorly. It would have been ok if they did not wait 5 minutes for a guy who was late$LABEL$3
Friendly staff and all but the bathroom was rundown and the wife lifted the slip around the mattress and the mattress was streaked$LABEL$2
Scary awful. I needed a room by the airport for an early morning flight. I've always had good experiences in the past so I booked a room.The first thing I see when I walk in the door is an angry woman named \""Chrystal\"" (refuses to give a last name) with a look on her face you only see on a bad day at the DMV or on a prison inmate. I think maybe she's having a bad day (or a bad life) so I smile anyway rather than doing what I should have done and headed straight out the door. The angry \""Chrystal\"" just continues to look like she found a turd in her lunchbox. I let angry Crystal know we are Rewards Members thinking this might soften her belligerent glare. No luck. After an agonizing minute of talking with her$LABEL$1
I would give this place a 0 star if I could! KYRA$LABEL$1
Not the best Courtyard I've stayed at$LABEL$3
I have been eating at greens since I was a little kid. I still go there with my husband every Saturday that I am in Charlotte. It is a tiny little place that has been there forever but they have the best hotdogs around. The chili is smooth and yummy. They also always make your crinkle fries when you order them$LABEL$5
I had a BLT and cheese fries. The BLT and Cheese fries were ok. I think the thing here is the prices are reasonable (not that cheap for what you get$LABEL$3
I had two dogs$LABEL$2
A stone's throw from Bank of America Stadium (I would say a hail mary pass away$LABEL$3
Felt like it was overrated$LABEL$4
One of the oldest hotdog / hamburger joints in Charlotte. Burgers and hotdogs are fresh and made to order. Charlotte Classic$LABEL$5
Old school Charlotte.  Simple$LABEL$5
Little confused here.. tried to get a hot dog from the cart outside the Fargo last week$LABEL$1
If you're looking for that good 'ol skinny dog in a steamy hot bun$LABEL$3
Basic dive with boiled dogs$LABEL$3
Festivals. Fun. Beer. Lots of beer. Charlotte Center City Partners (or Find Your Center) puts on a lot of these types of festivals Uptown and in South End. When you check out their website or their weekly newsletter you'll be able to see lots of events coming up like Beer$LABEL$4
For fun in Center City$LABEL$4
Didn't see too much in particular that I loved about this place. It is very small$LABEL$2
Very functional spot is what I would call this place.  Located in Wells Fargo 3 on the way out to the Green or Aquavina. They have a couple coffee varieties every day as well as muffins (YUM lemon poppyseed!!!) and store bought bagels.  The prices are cheap and the service is friendly and quick.  There are a few tables to chat or you can chat in the wide hall outside.  They sell cereal too!!!  How fun!$LABEL$3
While sitting outsite this location (Wells Fargo Bld 3) It came across my mind that I could write a review about my 1st$LABEL$3
Located next to the lobby area of Well Fargo 3$LABEL$4
Jackson's Java is hidden in the lobby of Wells Fargo 3. It is a deviation from your typical Starbucks/Dean & Deluca but it doesn't have a local coffee shop feel either. The bagels and pastries are all decent store bought items. They offer a wide variety of espresso drinks and teas. The reason for the middle of the road star rating is the inconsistency. Sometimes my drink tastes great and other times its on the border of undrinkable. I don't understand it$LABEL$3
This place is great. It's an old building but they really make it work and don't fight their limitations at all.  It's well located$LABEL$5
This hotel is nothing special (for my purposes)$LABEL$3
We booked through Hotwire while in town for a bowl game under their hot rate$LABEL$1
If I could give 10 stars I would!  This hotel went above and beyond when my Uncle fell ill and had to be hospitalized while visiting Charlotte.  They used their London Cab to come and pick us up at the hospital even though it was out of their cab range.  They also gave me a discounted rate on another room so I could stay in Charlotte and take care of my Uncle.  Now on to the hotel itself$LABEL$5
Perfect. Cocktails in the bar. Room service for breakfast. The suite was beautiful. Romantic. NYE already booked. Great location and plenty of things to do without having to get in your auto. We could live at this hotel. 8-) This is not the typical chain hotel....That is a great thing.$LABEL$5
Stayed here overnight while visiting for the Liverpool-AC Milan game. Arrived at 3:30pm but the room wasn't even ready despite check in being 3pm. Bed in room wasn't a queen size it was a full size so this is false advertising. I know this for a fact as we just changed from a full size to a queen size bed at home so we are aware of the size difference. In addition the mattress was very soft and the bed frame felt like it might fall apart any time - so we didn't have a great night's sleep which made the 7 hour drive home tough!A/C unit on wall glowed bright blue all through the night$LABEL$2
Great hotel! Came here for the weekend with my boyfriend. It was my first time in charlotte and I loved it. Check out was at 12 and they allowed extended checkout which was helpful. Complementary coke and water in the room was awesome! The room was nice with fluffy pillows. Ac was nice and cold and the shower head had great pressure! (Its the little things that matter)  definitely recommend this hotel to anyone looking for a nice hotel to stay at.$LABEL$5
The hotel was great. Complimentary breakfast$LABEL$5
Turns out the old$LABEL$4
I am going to keep this simple. My wife and I ate dinner at the McNinch house for our 5 year anniversary. The place was so slow. The valet guy was our waiter and bus boy. (probably the chef also$LABEL$2
So...it's been at least two years since I've been to McNinch and I still remember the experience like it was yesterday. And I have to agree with Bill on this one$LABEL$5
Came here for a private function/total buy-out with about forty people and was a bit disappointed.  This was not a four star dining experience.  It was a very pleasant service experience$LABEL$2
Ill start my review by stating that ive been working in the food industry for 7 years now$LABEL$2
My friend and I came here for an elegant dinner. The atmosphere is very nice.  A jacket is required and no cell phones are allowed in the dinning room.  This historic house is beautiful and well maintained. Much of the decor is original. The service was spectacular. Despite the nice atmosphere$LABEL$3
We had a 5-course meal and wine pairings.  The wine is why I gave it 2-stars; otherwise would've been worse as food was very bland.  No creativity to the cooking.  I enjoy extremely nice meals but McNinch is way overpriced for what you get.$LABEL$2
As a celebration for my birthday and a recent promotion$LABEL$5
Went for a romantic dinner with my wife. Excellent food. Chose the 5 course selection. Delightful service$LABEL$5
My partner took me to Alexander Michael's last night for dinner.  When he lived in Uptown$LABEL$5
I love Al Mike's. The restaurant is hidden in the beautiful First Ward neighborhood. They've got great food$LABEL$4
Just wow. If you ever come to Charlotte$LABEL$5
Okay it's a cool looking building with a nice little history. Other than that why are people peeing their pants for this place?I admit we only ordered fried pickles (which were good) so perhaps the food is superb. The beer selection was subpar (something I consider vital to have a good bar; either that or really really cheap specials). I'm glad I went once. Likely not again.$LABEL$3
When I first moved to Charlotte more than a few people mentioned Alexander Michael's to me.  I had my expectations built up.  The place is solid and a decent pub/neighborhood restaurant.  I might have rated it better if people hadn't built it up to me so much before going.  If I lived near the place I would go pretty frequently for a beer or some food.  But I wouldn't go out of my way to get to it (like i would with some other Charlotte places).  All in all - a solid pub/neighborhood bar with some character but nothing earth shattering.$LABEL$3
We really liked the pub feel of this place and the location hidden among the houses. It could be easy to miss if you didn't know it was there. The inside didn't feel like a house at all$LABEL$3
Cute little bar tucked away in the 4th ward neighborhood.  Fun atmosphere - and apparently a big pole in the middle of the women's bathroom (see back of menu).  Had the nachos$LABEL$4
Quaint$LABEL$4
Love this place.  Great food and unique character.  A must if you live in Charlotte.$LABEL$5
I used Yelp for the first time after a friend of mine informed me of it's awesomeness.  I was looking for a fun night out with my husband and I came across Alexander Michael's$LABEL$4
Al Mike's looks like a house that turned their 1st floor into a bar. The atmosphere is really chill$LABEL$4
LOVE everything about this place.  Great atmosphere$LABEL$5
We were taken here by a couple of locals (I guess we're locals now too though) on Wednesday night and fun was had.  It's got a busy$LABEL$3
Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food$LABEL$4
I have to laugh b/c this is the second time I find myself quoting Nicole W. but she said it best \""Alexander Michael's is the quintessential go-to spot for solid food$LABEL$4
Ok I stumbled over this place by being invited by a friend. I have lived in Charlotte for going on three months and had no idea this place exsisted.  It is tcuked away in a neighborhood right in downtown.  I hear this place is a establishment in Charlotte and has been around for a long time.  I now know why..  the food is fantastic! The fried pickles are a must a littel salty but good.  I had the Fried Chicken Special with Garlic mash with Gravy and it was GOOOOOOOODD!!!  My friend had the London Broil and looked amazing and the prices were so reasonable.  I highly recommend this place its a chance to see a good ol local hangout in the city of Charlotte.$LABEL$4
This is my favorite watering hole when I am in Charlotte. A great place in a great area. The staff is great too.Typical bar food and when my group goes the place can count on cooking about 80% of the menu. You go for the burgers and wings$LABEL$4
This was our first visit to Alexander Mike's but picked it based of previous reviews =) and because it is not far from the Fillmore music venue. When we arrived$LABEL$4
Love this place for its micro beers and spicy crab soup. The london broil looks amazing but i did not try it. Five people at my table ordered and greedily scarfed it down leaving crumbs not even fit for a mouse. Hehe ya that good! Can't wait to waunder in again and i love that they have local meats on there menu.Our server was so sweet too.$LABEL$5
You know that house in college where all your stoner friends lived that had all those tie-dyed sheets up all over the place for \""decor\"". Imagine they decided to open a restaurant serving a bunch of beers and expensive food. This is the vibe I get here.From the bearded bartender who looks like he just woke up$LABEL$3
One of our favorite cozy places to eat in Uptown.  Dark and cozy booths$LABEL$4
I've been to Alexander Michael's a few times now and always have a great time.  It has a ton of character - tucked away on a little street of old houses in the 4th ward.  The wait staff is always friendly$LABEL$4
Definitely a great  place to stop in for a beer and a good (not fussy or overpriced) bite to eat if you are in or near 4th Ward.  This place is a  Charlotte instititution! I have many fond memories of gathering with friends at Al Mike's throughout the 90's!$LABEL$4
Incredible nachos.  Incredible food. Try their best sellers.  Atmosphere is quaint. Great for a casual date night. Enjoy!$LABEL$4
My first impression was what a cute neighborhood! The historic and charming homes are such a treat in a city where everything seems brand new. Upon entering this pub-like restaurant/bar we were seated and greeted promptly. I ordered a cider on tap (a favorite of mine)$LABEL$3
Luckily for me$LABEL$4
One of my favorite places to eat in Uptown. My go to dishes are the London broil entree and the what it is. Tried out most of the menu and can't say I've had anything bad. The daily specials are usually pretty great as well.$LABEL$5
On Thursday$LABEL$5
I agree with most of the group.  A hidden gem here in Charlotte.  As you sit in the restaurant and watch the horse and carriage go by$LABEL$4
In 79 reviews$LABEL$4
There's something about the simplicity of this place$LABEL$4
Such a great low key place to go and have a great dinner. Their Fried pickles are amazing and have an awesome beer selection! This is my go to place for a fun relaxing evening dinner uptown.$LABEL$5
Tucked away on the outskirts of uptown/downtown Charlotte sits the cute and quaint Alexander Michael's. While my best friend and his boyfriend were in town for the holidays$LABEL$5
One of my favorite places in Charlotte. Super cozy inside$LABEL$5
Awesome little place. When I was touring the 4th ward$LABEL$4
I'm always looking for the local favorites (a grateful thank you to Katie from the Mint Museum Uptown for the recommendation). I have to say that the reviews for this wonderful local American pub are not misleading.Dark old school interior with lots of bead-board wainscoting$LABEL$3
I'm going to be the odd person and not give this place a glowing review.First off$LABEL$2
Went for dinner and really enjoyed it.  It was a Thursday night at 8 and the place was full but we didn't wait at all as I think we got the last table.  I've been here one other time on a Friday or Saturday and we had to wait 30 minutes for a table of 2.  The service was good and pretty quick for how busy they were.We tried the Ruben and it was one of the better Rubens we have had.  The sides were a little better than average$LABEL$4
Atmosphere was good$LABEL$4
I really enjoyed this restaurant. It was inviting$LABEL$4
This place is amazing. It is a hidden restaurant right in uptown Charlotte. The food is amazing. The drinks are amazing$LABEL$5
Stopped by here for an early lunch. The place wasn't crowded at all so we were immediately seated and got our drinks. The waitress and other employees were very friendly and were always around when we needed something. The food was delicious. I had the Mikes Hot Turkey Sandwich$LABEL$5
Need a good$LABEL$4
Perfect hole in the wall$LABEL$5
This is our neighborhood tavern and I love taking out-of-town guests here.  The food is great and has a homestyle quality.  Our favorites are the fried pickles app$LABEL$5
Best meal I've had since moving back from Columbus! If you are ever in the area$LABEL$5
We've been to Alexander Michaels a few times and love it each time. I find it to be romantic and quant. Our last trip was on Valentine's Day. We arrived early as they are first come first serve even on Holidays.  We started out with two beers and an order of potato wedges. The bacon and cheese covered dish was delicious and I'd get it again (without tomatoes).  For my entree I had the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich with Cajun Fries and my husband had the London Broil Sandwich. We both enjoyed our meal and would recommend both menu items. We did not have any dessert this time$LABEL$4
I haven't been to this place  in a VERY LONG time. Years ago$LABEL$2
Bad food. Bug problem. In a neighborhood full of homeless roaming the streets like zombies.$LABEL$1
One of our favorite local places in uptown. The 4th ward is very special and Alexander Michaels fits right in. We took a Segway tour one night and learned that the building is haunted too. The fried pickles are very good and the blackened fish sandwich is delicious. There are a number of local brews on tap and the atmosphere is great. Just a great place to hang. The restaurant can get a little loud but not too bad. It is a cozy location so that is to be expected.$LABEL$5
This place is awesome. The \""what it is\""...so delicious. I'm from Cincinnati and we come here at least once any time we are in town.$LABEL$5
Perfect atmosphere. Best BLT$LABEL$5
I had a great time here last night. Good beer selection and tasty food. I had a watermelon beer which was really delicious$LABEL$4
My husband and I went for lunch here and we loved it! It's located in a great location uptown and the service was great! My husband enjoyed the wings and I had a fantastic sandwich! Can't wait to go back and experience during dinner.$LABEL$4
I wish the GPS had been right about the derelict building it had initially brought me to....I would have been happily on my way to a satisfying meal elsewhere.....perhaps a place that doesn't have two legal parking places in a 5 block radius ....one of which is occupied by the restaurants mascot. An old beat up pick up truck....which seems to have avoided citation for 20 years.  When this gem was recommended to me as a fantastic \""seasonal\"" restaurant$LABEL$2
First of all$LABEL$2
Showmars on 3rd delivers solid food$LABEL$3
Nice people$LABEL$4
Cindy mans the register and makes u feel welcome and at home...the fish sandwich is fantabulous and a must have. I call order my breakfast and for 3 bucks I have my breakfast to go. Gotta luv it!!$LABEL$5
I was with a group of 4 and we ended up at this location right before closing. The staff was very nice even though we showed up about 10 minutes before closing. We were with a lady who lived in Charlotte for a long time. She insisted we must have the sweet tea...makes sense because sweet tea in the real South is what I call diabetic coma sweet and just how I like it. The sweet tea did NOT disappoint...matter if fact I drank ALOT of it. We joked with the lady that she should just leave the pitcher. Lol. She thought we were crazy...we were...crazy for sweet tea For my actual food I had the original pita burger...a burger served in a pita with some kind of greekish sauce (I think). What ever kind of sauce it was it was good. The fries that came with it were just basic and seasoned with salt. Maybe seasoning salt would add a little flair and taste. The onion rings were cheap and just okay. To me they taste as if they didn't have any seasoning. Overall we received exceptional service$LABEL$4
I enjoyed their Southern music audio tour which was small$LABEL$4
I came for the Day of the Dead festival this weekend$LABEL$4
Having walked by this museum countless number of times$LABEL$3
I visited the Levine Museum this afternoon.  I really enjoyed the history of  Charlotte and the progression from the cotton industry$LABEL$3
Very objective and incredibly well written. Deceptively large and packed with with information.Prepare to take at least an hour and be ready for a history that pulls no punches. The truth hurts and so everything from slavery and the life of the poor farmer to the whole lynching dedicated exhibit is incredibly intense and gripping.A great inspiration.$LABEL$5
Interesting museum in uptown. From California so it is always interesting to learn about the history of the south. Great family location for an outing to make the day also educational. Brought my daughter who enjoyed the interaction displays that made the experience more fun.$LABEL$4
I first visited this museum several weeks ago. I took in the permanent exhibit on the history of Charlotte. It is a fantastic hands-on exhibit. My kids and I truly enjoyed not only being able to read and look at historical artifacts$LABEL$5
Before my business trip to Charlotte$LABEL$3
We just happened to be at 7th Street Market on a Sunday when the museum had free admission.  Awesome!  I have no idea how much the normal admission fare is$LABEL$4
We visited the museum this afternoon and I feel bad giving just three stars$LABEL$3
I enjoyed myself here$LABEL$4
The queen of the bloated corporate steakhouses!  Save your money.....find a local street vendor.....and buy tickets to whatever is at the Blumenthal!!$LABEL$2
My husband and I went to Morton's couple months ago. We just came back from our anniversary trip. It was late at night$LABEL$4
Yawn.I've eaten 2 meals at mortons and honestly - I can do better at home. Sure the food was good - but dropping $100+ dollars and not being thoroughly impressed isn't my idea of great value.Save you're $ go buy a steak and a $20 bottle of wine at the Harris Teeter and fire up your grill - you'll pay 30 bucks and have just as good of a meal.$LABEL$2
I'm sorry but what is the big deal?!? I can get great steak for a lot less $$. And everything is ala carte! No way. I was not impressed by anything here. Ruth's Chris is better! But quality steaks can be eaten at much better priced establishments.$LABEL$2
I was looking for a great steakhouse in Charlotte! I know longer have to look any further. Between the delicious anniversary steak dinner and the best wait staff; Morton's is my favorite place.$LABEL$5
Even though the new york strip I had was thick and juicy$LABEL$3
This is my favorite steakhouse. There are many great steakhouses out there but Morton's is always consistent.  The ribeye is my favorite cut there.  They make them perfect.  The sides are good but the steaks are so big you may not have much room for them.  I also recommend either their French onion soup or their tomato salad as an appetizer.  Definitely can't leave without having their molten chocolate cake for dessert.  The drinks for the bar are good as well.  You can end up spending a small fortune here though.$LABEL$5
So I went to Morton's on a \""date night\"" with my mom after a coworker gave her a gift certificate.  She had been there before and told me to prepare myself for probably the best meal I will ever eat.  And as much as I hate to admit this ...........she was right.Like other reviewers had stated$LABEL$5
We decided to change-up our Ruth's Chris experience with another high rated steakhouse. Just like any night out to dinner we dressed up with a nice top and jeans$LABEL$2
Went to Mortons and the food was spot on. However$LABEL$3
I recently dined here for my anniversary and was deeply disappointed by the service.  Placed in a high traffic area; dirty dishes left on table; drinks not re-filled; server  not familiar with menu and special pricing; Did not get order right; I have expressed my concerns to Landry's and to the restaurant directly$LABEL$2
This was a terrible horrible experience this evening and I will never go to this Mortons again. I was sitting in the bar when a guy in dirty jeans and a t-shirt was so drunk at the bar he fell off his bar stool and I had to pick up the stools. I decided this situation was not going to get better so I left before ordering.  I walked out and phoned the manager and told him that I was upset that they served this guy until he was totally intoxicated and could not even walk out of there.  He apologized and asked me to come back as he was gone.  I walked up and he was still staggering around outside and I walked in.  Rich said he was sorry and I sat back at the bar and he wanted to buy me an appetizer and a drink and I said okay.  The bartender never came back to me to take my drink order.  I decided to leave and the manager was outside still trying to take care of the situation with the drunk with the police. He saw me leave and I shook his hand and said thanks anyway and I walk away and when all else fails HOOTERS makes a mean chicken wing but would of rather had my Filet and BroccoliOh Well$LABEL$2
I must start by the service was absolutely amazing tonight. I have read some of the reviews here and was hesitant to make a reservation but it appears that the staff tonight has works our any kinks.  Kevin the ma\u00eetre d made us feel absolutely welcome. Stephanie our server really knew the menu was able to guide is through many of our choices. We had our 9 year old daughter with us and both Kevin and Stephanie went out of their way to make her feel special. They were very impressive for a place that isn't usually \""kid friendly\"". The food was good as usual and the steaks$LABEL$5
Good steak. Service was great. Speedy service requested and speedy service received... Would recommend if your looking for a decent steak  in the charlotte area..$LABEL$3
For the price you pay at Mortons$LABEL$3
Best steakhouse in Charlotte! The steaks are so tender & juicy there is no substitute for that beef. I'm also very impressed with chefs that know how to cook a steak to order$LABEL$5
We ordered a bottle of Cabernet Sauvignon from Raymond Vineyards designed especially for Morton's called primal cut and it was boldly delicious and perfect for the steaks we ordered.Superb aged four weeks steaks! My husband had the porterhouse and I had the NY strip both perfectly prepared medium rare! We ordered a side of mushrooms in au jus and they accompanied the steaks nicely.Before the steaks arrived they served fresh butter and a hot boule of bread that you could smell baking because of the scent of the toasted onion on top. We also shared the Morton's salad which is greens mixed with blue cheese dressing topped with egg and anchovies. All the portions are ginormous and so easily shared!My husband ordered the molten hot lava chocolate cake served with vanilla ice cream and caramel sauce which was made to order and ordered when we ordered the steaks. It was divinely chocalatey! He also ordered a tawny port to end the meal. I had tastes and sips of both and they were delicious$LABEL$5
The food and service was excellent. Our sever Tara was on point. She was very knowledge. The restaurant is going through some remodeling and it gives it a more modern look. I enjoy everything and will be back$LABEL$5
Poor service and the food was overpriced for the quality. Nothing tasted bad but it was way too expensive. I would recommend Capital Grille over Morton's.$LABEL$2
Matt's Chicago Dogs are delish!  I love going there$LABEL$4
I love a good dog.  Matt's Chicago dogs always look and taste very fresh. They have a broad variety of sandwiches$LABEL$4
I popped in here for a quick bite cause who's not a fan of hot dogs??I took a quick gander at the menu board and after closing my mouth and wiping the drool$LABEL$4
Chicago is only minutes away from uptown Charlotte.  Didn't you know that?  Well$LABEL$4
Ahhhhhh. The neon green relish. The crisp$LABEL$4
Mmm hmm it rivals red hot lovers of Ann Arbor$LABEL$4
Working in uptown Charlotte you won't find a lot of places with out door seating without paying paying more then $10 for lunch. Dean and Deluca is a good example of that. Matt's is nice because it's located right on the green and only a few blocks from Trade and Tryon.  The good: Burgers$LABEL$3
I stopped at Matt's for a quick bite while attending a conference.  The location was perfect -- close to the convention center$LABEL$4
Good inexpensive eats. The have ridiculous combinations for dogs and burgers and the prices are extremely fare. I will definitely return the next time I am in Charlotte.$LABEL$4
I must have been in a haze of goodness that I gave a 4.5 the first time. I was recently in NC to visit my BF's family again and I dragged my boyfriend through Charlotte to all the places i went to with my family in the summer.Number one on my list was Matt's Chicago Dog. First I want to say$LABEL$5
I'm a Carolina native$LABEL$4
I am so hungry for one right now. I think they have some sort of deal where you can buy multiple dogs and sides for a deal. But it's a toss up what you get. I recommend buying a  Matt's Chicago Dog. Don't leave it up to chance.$LABEL$4
With a ton of lunch options in the Uptown area$LABEL$4
I tried their Italian Beef and its \""meh\"". Not really close to being what you can get in Chicago$LABEL$4
Don't know what the deal was$LABEL$1
Fast and friendly. Couldn't ask for more.Why aren't there more coffee shops around here?!$LABEL$3
Another Starbucks review? I've come to realize that not all Starbucks are the same and this one is somewhat lackluster. I ordered a medium iced Americano and overheard the baristas tell one another that it looked kinda weak.  They made it anyway and gave it to me.  I told them (politely of course) that it was and they made another one regular strength.  That's definitely not Starbucks signature customer service.  I can't say I will go back to this particular Starbucks$LABEL$2
Man does this bus get busy around 1 ish? . Baristas are super nice!While starbux isn't my coffee house of choice this one is located right across from my school so i hosnestly frequent it quite often. Its a good place to study with a total of 4 big poofy green chairs but only two electrical outlets so make sure ur laptop is charged! The drinks are pretty consistant. Bold coffees change periodically bt if they don't have your bold of choice$LABEL$3
Very busy starbucks.$LABEL$3
Another 'Bucks Uptown...things you need to know about this location!-Decent amount of street (metered) parking available-The line can get loooooong$LABEL$3
Employees are very friendly and my simple iced coffee order is always made to my liking.  I don't frequent this particular starbucks often though because I can never find an open parking space. They have some metered spots right out front but they are always taken when I'm needing my caffeine fix!  It is also a smaller store and there are not a lot of available outlets to plug in my laptop.  In fact$LABEL$3
Somehow$LABEL$3
As the duly-designated Johnnie Cochran of this particular Starbucks at Gateway Village$LABEL$4
Starbucks at Gateway Village was recently remodeled and it is simply a great place to go for coffee.  It is setup now for ease of entry and exit.  The setup allows you get your order in...and get your coffee and go.  I enjoy the mild Blonde blend and add some vanilla for more flavor.  The new seating areas are inviting.  Great place to have a \""non-business\"" or business meeting.$LABEL$4
Niec place to get a pint or watch a game... there food is suprisingly good... they have some sort of brisket sliders that are freaking awesome... if you are in uptown and need a place to watch sports with good food this is it...$LABEL$4
Great sports bar with a ton of rooms - it's almost like a maze. Huge TVs everywhere$LABEL$3
Hmmm..... where to start with this one. I'll go with atmosphere$LABEL$2
Went with a galpal for lunch not long ago. The atmosphere was$LABEL$3
My girl and I rolled into Charlotte on a Monday at around 9. Living in New York gives one a certain confidence in finding places to dine at all hours of the night. Apparently that's not how this particular section of Charlotte gets down. We wandered around for about 20 minutes on the poorly lit$LABEL$5
My pasta tasted like rubber$LABEL$2
I had some friends in town from Chicago and they really wanted to find a bar to watch a Bears game. So we headed to Fox & Hound to check it out. My friend quickly dubbed the bar a \""Football Model UN\"" because of the variety of football fans there. Fox & Hound probably had 10 games going in different areas of the bar$LABEL$3
Fox & Hound has some decent specials on their drinks.  It near a couple of good restaurants downtown$LABEL$4
Visited for lunch on the weekend. This place maybe good for game watching in the evenings but I do not think they are equipped for much else. I sat in a booth in the bar area and you could see they hadn't cleaned the walls in or near the booth in quite some time because of the old dried up food on the wall. Also the bathrooms where in bad shape.Service: Slow and I'm not sure we where the servers to priority because there were not many other people in the place and we had to wait for everything.Not a good experience for us.$LABEL$2
I'm with Mike B. I have visited 2 Fox & Hound Bars now (the other up in Huntersville) - both get two thumbs down on the food. Both had good beer selection$LABEL$1
One of my favorite places to watch \""the game.\"" On the weekends$LABEL$4
This place blows chunks.  I would have given it just one star but the waitresses are fab and cute.  The whole place smells like it has been through a flood and instead of getting the place cleaned properly they spent the insurance money on new cars.  I have had the wings here..blah and the veggies are gross with brown tips on the celery.  Yuck.  It is a huge space and has cool giant tvs so if I was just here to watch the game and drink it would be okey dokey.  There are a ton of places to watch the game though that have great food...sigh....$LABEL$2
I really hate this place. I've given it 3 chances$LABEL$2
One of the nicer Fox and Hounds I've been to.HUGE area inside on multiple levels.  We spent our time there in the \""basement\"" part one night when Kevin Pitsnogle was going off on Wake Forest during the NCAA Tournament.A little pricey$LABEL$3
We got into the city late and looked for a fast bite. Typical bar food and cheap beer. I had some 2 dollar drafts and had some nachos. The crowd got a bit rough later on through the night.$LABEL$3
Went with a friend for an early lunch before heading back to Raleigh.  The business has three levels$LABEL$4
Simply a bad experience. A group of us came to Charlotte from Cheyenne for a training course and wanted a good local place have dinner and drinks. The place wasn't busy at all and it took 20 minutes from the time we sat down to get out drink order taken and get our beverages. The food took way too long as well and was only lukewarm. I assure you I will not return to this establishment on this trip or any future trips.$LABEL$1
This abomination certainly left much to be desired. There was a considearble wait from the ordering of drinks to receiving them$LABEL$1
Took for ever just to get water and to take our order. We were there for over an hour before we got our food and it was cold. Will not return.$LABEL$1
Groupon has allowed me to try new restaurants in places I never knew existed.I Have been to uptown many times and never noticed Fox and Hound. That could also be Rock Bottom Brewery sits across the street and makes this place seem so much smaller. My visit was at 2pm and we experienced some difficulty with parking. It also is DNC week and parking is off limits except for a few places along the street. Luckily we found one after circling 4 times. We walked in and it was awkward. One of those moments that you see in movies where a bar is noisy everyone stops and stares then goes about their business. Normally this isn't an issue but when the waitress and bartender does this its....awkward. We found a booth and sat and waited to be greeted. We waited$LABEL$1
Came here on a Saturday afternoon to watch the football game. The place was empty at noon which was confusing$LABEL$3
It was OK.  Not the best experience.  I was a little scared after I ate there$LABEL$3
The atmosphere is like any other chain sports bar$LABEL$2
We just received the worst service ever I will never come back. Its shocking that on wing special night it was merly 6 tables. One person actually went to the back to fix their own drinks. We had To ask for everything numerous of times. Service was very slow ass and the management was not customer friendly. I personally was not thinking to take pictures of all the screw ups due to all of the complaints the whole table was making. I hated to make so many complaints but I've never experienced such horrible service. It was awful We couldn't find any positive in it. As a matter of fact the waitress didn't even come back to pick up all the checks. It Was 7 of us and 6 ppl got their checks. We told the management We needed to pay another check and that We didn't know why the waitress would leave one out$LABEL$1
My girlfriend and I came to the Blumenthal Performing Arts Center (shamefully) for the first time last night to see Traces$LABEL$3
not your average Irish pub... on the weekends it can get packed... and upstars they have a DJ or band and it can get a lil crazy... on big nights it is hard to move beacuse of so many pople but i guess it is like that everywhere in CLT... i have never eaten there food... but have heard it is ok...$LABEL$4
So I'm stuck here for work for a week and found this nice pub.  Not exactly my scene$LABEL$3
Civilized$LABEL$1
The food looks great so I'd definitely try it again for lunch or dinner.  But it's a tiny space$LABEL$2
Over-crowded$LABEL$1
Ri Ra's is a popular place to go if you're up for a big (and by \""big\""  I mean wild and drunk) night out in Uptown Charlotte--that much has been well-documented. I've definitely partaken of a few of these nights. It's a nice bar$LABEL$3
Ri-Ra's is an Irish pup$LABEL$3
a sports bar galorecold french fries make me so sadeighteen dollars gone$LABEL$2
With Dave all the way (well$LABEL$3
First time I've been to Ri Ra in a looong time.  Pre fire?  Absolutely$LABEL$3
I went for a Saturday afternoon World Cup game for third place between Germany and Uruguay.  Most tables in front of the screen were taken but not packed so it wasn't too noisy.  Service was really slow but the waitress was authentic.  Not the best review since I ordered a salad at a pub but the salad was good & fresh.  I tried the sweet potato fries too.  The fries were a little soggy but will go back under different circumstances to try them out since the beer selection is extensive and within walking distance.$LABEL$4
Went in to meet some friends who'd come in from out of town.  Lovely place$LABEL$1
Last time I went it was about 3pm on a weekday and there were 3 guys sitting at the bar Ttalking with a male bartender.  I stood there for approx 5-7 mins before I was even acknowledged.  Needless to say$LABEL$1
I went back to RiRa's for lunch today and sat on their rooftop terrace to enjoy the gorgeous weather.  I ordered the hummus wrap with the vegetable stack.  It was delicious!  They also had a breakfast/brunch menu.  My husband ordered an omlette with brisket.  He commented on the fresh eggs and cheese but said the brisket was the star of the show.  He was pleased that the brisket was mixed into the omlette not just folded over the ingredients.The omlette came with potatoes and a thick cut of toast perfectly toasted.  I mean where else can you get brunch severed with such a great beer selection?!$LABEL$4
I went to Ri Ra recently on a Friday night for a coworkers going away shindig.  I had a really good time.  I enjoyed the dark cave like old time bar aesthetic.  The had some diverse options on tap.  In the downstairs area there was some live acoustic guitar/singer.  Upstairs consisted of a DJ and lights - playing standard top hits.  There is a deck off the 2nd floor that was pretty popular the night I was there - a nice respite from the noise inside.$LABEL$3
Overall a decent a irish experience. The landscape is a little confused and varies night to night. Sometimes it's a fratty hang out$LABEL$3
I always manage to go here when there is a decent cover band playing on the 2nd floor.  Usually my group of friends show up early enough (right when dinner is ending) and the bar transitions into night mode so we always miss a cover (if there is one)... The coziness of the upstairs makes for a great experience.One bad thing to mention was the staff... we were ordering drinks and it seemed like it was taking forever.  Yes$LABEL$4
Good dinner and lunch menu food.  I'd call it authentic Irish pub fare$LABEL$3
Hoegaarden on tapWhen you're in an Uptown moodRi Ra is the bomb$LABEL$4
Moderate beer choices and decent food. Even though this is a very cookie-cutter Irish pub$LABEL$3
Was Disaponinted with the amount of time it took me to get service at the bar !! Staff was friendly and the decar was nice.$LABEL$3
The following things make Ri Ra amazing$LABEL$5
I was fairly unimpressed with my food at Ri Ra... I ordered the lamb burger$LABEL$2
Ri Ra is one of the coolest bars in Charlotte from a decor/ambiance perspective. After work it's loud and crowded and energetic - exactly as it should be. What I really wish is that the kitchen staff were able to produce quality food to go along with that ambiance. I ordered one of my favorite comfort food dishes - cottage pie. What I was served was: sparse ground beef$LABEL$2
Super friendly Irish pub that KNOWS how to pour a Guiness. The place was jumping when I got there. They have a good happy hour$LABEL$4
I never had the food here$LABEL$4
Came here for lunch$LABEL$3
I was visiting Charlotte for business and came for lunch with my boss. The sandwich line was pretty long so we decided to go inside the restaurant to sit down and order. The hostess and server was great. We ordered and our food was brought out fairly quickly. It was a Monday and lunchtime but the place was not packed when we got there. A few more customers did trickle in while we were there but it wasn't crowded. My boss ordered a soup and sandwich combo and he said it was delicious. I ordered the Irish stew with a side of cesar salad. Both were delicious as well. I loved how the stew is made with lamb and it a nice cracked pepper taste to it. A co-worker of mine said that they have the best macaroni and cheese but I did not try it. I wanted to try the fish and chips may have to do this on my next business trip. There are way too many restaurants in the area that I have not tried yet and want to before I go home.$LABEL$3
The sandwich bar is underrated in my opinion.  It's basically a make-your-own place where you pick the bread$LABEL$4
Great food. I had the hooley kebab for dinner. It was on the lunch menu but they still let me order it. Huge portion. Tasted my dads lamb stew and loved it! It was trivia night so winning 50 bones certainly helped w that 5th star;)$LABEL$5
OK$LABEL$1
Here is my quick 2 second review -Apps are great. Defiantly get the wings (mild and Jameson honey glaze) and the baked spinach dip.Dinner was just okay - I had the kilcooly. The turkey was a bit dry$LABEL$3
Have been to Ri Ra many times. It is a must stop each and every time I am in Charlotte. Obviously$LABEL$3
Let's be specific... I'm a fan of Ri Ra because one of my favorite cover band plays here often... and it's a nice low key joint for the most part.  No I'm not a fan of the super crowded nights when crazy drunken young men can get into fights just because the other person took a breath.  Recently I went there with a group of friends on our little 5th Street bar crawl night.  And I have become a fan of their curry fries!  Something addictive about a box of HOT fries mixed with a sweet yet savory curry sauce.  I don't think it's because it's late night and we've been drinking... or that I didn't have dinner (though I'm sure it has something to do with it)$LABEL$4
I came here alone on a Tuesday night and had the Shepherd's pie and Harpoon special which was $4 a glass. The beer was good and food delicious. It was fairly cost effective for the area as well.$LABEL$5
First off$LABEL$3
I went out for the evening with my cousin since the place that she had a Groupon for was completely slammed last night...  We hemmed$LABEL$4
I understand everyplace has its rules. My friends had a pre-wedding party here. And at 10pm it becomes a \"" standing bar\"" only. But did your staff have to be rude to the parents who were still sitting down a little respect goes a long way. We will not be going back.$LABEL$1
Apparently$LABEL$2
The large employee guy with blonde hair was belligerent and trying to start fights with several us last night. He needs to be fired and needs to be some changes made.$LABEL$1
I have always heard good things about Ri Ra's but my experience was nothing spectacular.  Ri Ra's is a decently sized (2 medium sized rooms) Irish bar is downtown Charlotte next door to Prohibition.  My group stopped in Ri Ra's to meet up with a few others and I was not impressed.  After paying one of the most unjustified $5 covers of my life$LABEL$2
I've been here a few times and I always have a pretty good experience. It has a decent siize bar with many options of beer on tap. I've gotten Shepherd's Pie and it was pretty good. I'll stop in again for a couple of beers$LABEL$3
It really doesn't matter if you are coming to eat$LABEL$5
Went here for a birthday party. Awesome atmosphere$LABEL$3
Stopped in after the theater for a pint$LABEL$1
Granted time is of the essence$LABEL$5
Yea$LABEL$5
Wow... I am so surprised that this place has been around as long as it has! This used to be one of my regular hang-out spots when I worked in Bank of America's flagship tower around 16 or 17 years ago. Back in those days$LABEL$3
Fantastic pub atmosphere both indoor and on their rooftop area.  Great place to have a pint$LABEL$5
I've been here a few times at this point and it's always fairly good. The food is decent but nothing to rave about and the atmosphere is a good one. I haven't hung out here but from what I understand it's good for the bar experience. I usually go here to dine though as it's convenient to the Belk Theatre. This last visit I had steak tips and potatoes and honestly it wasn't great. The meat had a funny taste to it and the potatoes had no taste to them and some of them had gone bad I think. My grandmother had the fish and chips and she said it was decent. So for what it's worth that was our last experience. I've kind of combined all my trips into this one rating so 3 stars is about all I'd give it.$LABEL$3
This place is great. Good servers.  Takiyyah is the best. Ask for her.  Great food and a great place to bring a large group.$LABEL$5
I just went through the line at the sandwich shop in the courtyard of the Hearst Tower.  The sandwich/ salad makers were polite and fast$LABEL$1
I had the Cuban chicken sandwich$LABEL$3
Fun place! Good food and drinks. Live band upstairs on the weekends. However the bartender lost my credit card when I went to close it out only to call me the next day to say they found it. Too bad I had already closed my account. Maybe they should get a better system like swiping when you order vs. holding it?$LABEL$3
This happened a while ago (several months)$LABEL$1
We visited this pub on our first trip to Charlotte. The Guinness Stew and Potato Cakes were very tasty. Our server was friendly and fast. Our beers were never empty before we had a refill. Great place!$LABEL$4
(Only commenting on Ri Ra as a bar as I have not tried the food) Get some more staff! This place is terribly understaffed$LABEL$2
Came here for some drinks after a rehearsal dinner. I can't speak about the food but the bartender and service was great. I expected a Friday night in downtown Charlotte to be busy and hard to get drinks but it wasn't that hard. Yes$LABEL$5
Good Irish breakfast.  Even though this is chain$LABEL$3
R\u00ed R\u00e1 is so great and so lackluster at the same time.If it's late...if it's a weekend...prepare to pay a cover.  IMO$LABEL$3
This review is of their Ri Ra Sandwhich shop around the corner since there is no separate listing for this shop. Stopped here because I've never been before$LABEL$2
Just average unfortunately.  The good:  My drink...dark and stormy is going to be my new standby.  The mediocre:  Everything else.Burger was just so so as were the fries.  The burger was the 704...I honestly can't remember if It even came w/ the pickle chips.  The really really low point of the meal was the desert. The bread pudding was ice cold and hard as a rock. It did come smothered with a caramel sauce$LABEL$2
Went here for a corporate dinner. Had the finger sandwiches (chicken$LABEL$2
Superb service and reliably fine food from this family owned restaurant. Briskly busy at lunchtime$LABEL$5
We decided to give this place a try the first night my wife and I were in Charlotte for a conference / vacation. The decor instantly puts you at ease. Very comfortable$LABEL$5
Great asian food$LABEL$4
Great food$LABEL$4
This place is awesome.  Coming from NY where I've been spoiled with great chinese food$LABEL$5
This is probably the best Chinese food in uptown$LABEL$3
Soho is not on my list of places to go for lunch uptown$LABEL$3
Very impressed with certain items like the ' Sauteed Bean Sprouts w/ Ginger'. Could not believe that Bean sprouts could taste that good. Also liked the Buddha Roll and the Asian Summer Roll. Brocolli With Garlic Sauce was not that great and neither was Thai Curry Tofu. Veggie Lo mein was good too. My ratings Guide* Stay Away** Eat if you are hungry and can't find anything*** It's alright$LABEL$3
Old reliable. This place knows how to fit my lunch needs in a major way. I try to get here atleast once a week. They have some of the best chinese food in town.The twins that work the front are awesome and transition everybody in and out as efficiently as possible. They have yet to mess up my order$LABEL$4
I have never had better Chinese food. The food was fresh and no hint of MSG. The location is fantastic and centrally located to everything. It is small and intimate and they even offer vegetarian meals. I had the Lo Mein and it was so delicious. They offer drinks as well including beer and wine. The staff there is so friendly and the wait for our meal was minimal. The food was so delicious I've gone back again and again introducing it to friends and they love it as much as I do.$LABEL$5
I had carryout. Very quick but kinda confusing to find the place. I was expecting good things because the reviews seem to rave about this place but honestly I was really disappointed. The food is mediocre$LABEL$2
I have had Chinese food in a bunch of different cities$LABEL$2
Came here for the first time on 1/20/2012 with friends. Atmosphere isn't overly fancy like some places downtown$LABEL$4
Me$LABEL$5
I just moved here to Charlotte from NorCal and one of my favorite foods to eat back in Cali was Chinese food.  So I was excited to find this place.  I have to say it does NOT compare to Chinese back at home. I ordered potstickers (called dumplings here) and the skin was too thick and there was barely any meat inside.  Not a good first impression. I wanted chow mein so I ordered the House Lo Mein...too salty.  They put too much oyster sauce or soy sauce.  This also made the noodles squirmy.  I ordered broccoli on the side and at least that was good.  I hope there are better Chinese food spots out here.  Since this place was in Uptown I hope this isnt the best they got...3 stars because their service was good$LABEL$3
I've been a regular visitor of Soho practically since they opened$LABEL$5
In a lunch rush? You can count on Soho to delivery hot$LABEL$3
mmmmm....yummy food! Did not except such good food to be honest.$LABEL$4
It is my opinion there are no good Chinese restaurants Uptown$LABEL$2
We had lunch here during a rather unbusy Saturday.  Most places in this area seem to only serve dinner on Saturday so this was one the few seemingly vegan-friendly Saturday lunch spots.Sad to say$LABEL$2
Went here for lunch and we were the only ones in there. We got great service because of it$LABEL$3
So$LABEL$3
Food is decent$LABEL$2
The service was good and the food came out very soon after we ordered. The menu is extensive and has many different options of Thai and Chinese dishes. The menu offers anything from soup to noodle dishes to stir fry. I ordered their spicy soup with shrimp and it was very good and actually spicy and had a lot of veggies in it. The restaurant itself is but small but went during the week and it wasn't crowded at all! I would definitely eat here again and it's very close to the arena!$LABEL$5
This restaurant has been open for over 10 years$LABEL$5
Pretty good overall. I ordered a spring roll and an egg roll - both were a little bland (and greasy) for my taste. The steamed veggies were perfectly cooked - a combination of broccoli$LABEL$3
This is located in the heart of downtown. Food is average and service is not bad. Will be busy during peak lunch hours from 11:30 to 1:30 PM. But take out is very fast. I have been going here for past 7 years and one thing that sucks big time is the two Cantonese women who manages this place.  They have no idea what is a good service in a restaurant means. They are rude. Literally rude. Half the time you don't understand what they speak in English. No in this restaurant are polite. They serve food as if they are serving people in homeless place. And they never treat you as patrons by the way. Am I eating and dining there ? \""No\"". I am try taking out? \""Yes\""Location : 4/5Ambience: 3/5Service: 2/5Food: 2.5/5$LABEL$2
We stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for a trip and happened to visit Soho Bistro for dinner on a rainy evening. The restaurant is clean$LABEL$2
I just called  our delivery order in after ringing MANY local establishments that do not deliver. Their customer service is friendly and quick$LABEL$4
I've been going to this place for a few years now$LABEL$2
Have you ever been to a sports bar where there is no games on? Enough said. If I must give you more reason why you can skip this place$LABEL$2
Can you say$LABEL$1
Sports bars. I've been to good ones and bad ones. Champions located in the Marriott City Center is right in the middle. Nothing to write home about but it has all the basics. Want to catch a game? There are plenty of TV's around. The weird thing is that every screen was tuned to the same game when we walked in. We asked the bartender to put the Olympics up on a couple of them and she complied right away. So the trick to get what you want- lies in the hands of the bartender. (isn't that always the case?)Looking for food? This place has tons of choices. Granted$LABEL$3
Lack of Atmosphere (Even during sporting events)Food is terrible.Bartender/Waitress were incredibly rude....Everybody has bad days$LABEL$1
This is my type of place.  If you like sports$LABEL$4
So$LABEL$2
Found a long black hair in my burger. The buns were cold the meat patty was overcooked (asked for medium) and very thin. The side salad was decent$LABEL$1
Oy.  Why do I do this to myself.The service was fine$LABEL$2
Shame on me for not consulting Yelp prior to going here but I was uptown with my 6 y/o and she was in charge of finding somewhere to eat and chose this spot.  The service was fine$LABEL$2
I don't know who of my group picked this place out$LABEL$1
As for a place to spend money uptown I'd skip it.  The bar is ok$LABEL$2
Two stars? Haters$LABEL$3
I didn't think this place was so bad either$LABEL$3
When I first moved here in 1995 this and Ri Ra was the only 2 places downtown. I said to myself$LABEL$5
A friend from Chapel Hill came to visit us yesterday and we decided to take him to downtown Charlotte. Since most locations were closed$LABEL$2
Went in for a couple drinks and food. It was so slow that I actually asked one of the employees if they were closing. With that being said$LABEL$1
I had some time to kill this afternoon and was in the Downtown area looking for some lunch.  I was planning to catch a movie at the Epicenter and wanted some grup nearby.  It was a toss-up between Hooters and Champions and since I'd never been to Champions I decided to give it a try......When I first entered the place I stood by the hostess booth for about 5 minutes and nobody came to greet me or show me to a table...... or anything.  Then$LABEL$3
Great food$LABEL$4
The Marriott City Center has a great location close to everything. The rooms have been recently renovated and the restaurants and bars in the hotel do a nice job. The rooms are \""Marriott practical\"" meaning that all the things that you need to have a successful trip whether business or pleasure are there. Nice work area with plenty of outlets$LABEL$4
I'm not a big fan of Mariotts (prefer Starwood properties)$LABEL$4
Easily locatable with buildings all around.In the day time$LABEL$4
The Charlotte Marriott City Center hotel has a welcoming$LABEL$4
This hotel is in a great location and the rooms are good enough. The staff is friendly and there is a fantastic restaurant located in the lobby. So$LABEL$2
Went here for a conference/meeting. The hotel is at the center of the Charlotte business district. The location is perfect and there are lots of interesting restaurants to visit around the hotel. The rooms are fairly modern. Nothing fancy$LABEL$3
Rooms are very clean and the views are great.  The location is right in the heart of Charlotte and convenient to everything - easy walking!!$LABEL$4
This is a nice hotel with reasonable prices.  It's walking distance to almost everything uptown.  There are two restaurants and a Starbuck's on the property plus several more on the block.  Clean rooms$LABEL$4
Location$LABEL$3
What's good: tall hotels! Love em. Some nice view of uptown CLT. The fitness room is spacious and always empty...The folks are friendly to the point of ALMOST fawning$LABEL$3
What's that smell?Not sure if it is me but the rooms in that hotel have a weird smell very noticeable when I show up on Sundays. Some kind of wet used socks flavor ... I guess I get used to it and get less affected the rest of the week. Besides that$LABEL$2
Great location and nice clean rooms.  The housekeeping staff was not the best at keeping the noise down in the hallways though.  Other than that my stay was great.  I would stay here again in a heartbeat.  The place is right downtown and you can walk to just about anything you want.$LABEL$4
Stayed here for one night. Relatively quiet and still in the middle of Charlotte. Room didn't have much of a view but that's fine. Although when I woke up the next morning$LABEL$3
It is a bit over-priced for the quality of the rooms. But$LABEL$3
Only 2 stars for location. Rooms are humid and smell like wet dog. Worst hotel I have yet to stay in as a consultant.$LABEL$2
Charlotte Marriott city center is a nice hotel located in the perfect part of downtown. They have a decent sports bar and a good restaurant with reasonable \""hotel restaurant\"" prices.Many decent clubs and high-end restaurants are within walking distance.The rooms are comfortable with a large desk for working. +lots of plugsShower is hot$LABEL$4
Very comfortable hotel. The front desk staff is always so nice. I have hosted several meetings here and the complete experience has always been favorable. From in-room dining to restaurant options you will not go hungry. Walking distance to many great places through out downtown Charlotte. I always sleep like a a baby.$LABEL$4
Hotel is ok. Room was just ok. 6th floor and can definitely hear the street below me. I got an excellent suggestion for dinner at a place around the corner. One big downfall was that I called last night for the restaurant breakfast hours and was told it opened at 6:00. I planned the start of my day and morning calls based on this. And$LABEL$3
I booked this hotel for the 2014 ACC Championship game. I thought that this hotel$LABEL$1
We love the Marriott because they are usually in great locations and are clean. They belong to a nice corporation. We only stayed at this Marriott for a night. Checked in around 11pm. The guest service was awesome as usual. The room a/c didn't feel cool enough but granted we came from Northern Virginia where heat wasn't turned on at night. But it's a perfect location. Within a couple blocks of restaurants and bars. We will definitely be staying here on weekend getaways again.$LABEL$4
This place has some wonderful sandwiches. I work in the building next door so I frequent most of the dowtown (or as they call it uptown) establishments during the week.  They offer Boar's Head and normally offer a daily or weekly special.  This place gets a 2 b/c they have the worst customer service$LABEL$2
This is one of my ideal lunch spots even though it's the longest walk away. With a simplistic concept and an efficient assembly line$LABEL$4
I was pleasantly surprised by the food here. The salad dressing is really good and the miso has a hearty mushroom flavor. Prices are very reasonable. The nigiri is dirt cheap. Some pieces are $1. Hibachi entrees are under $10. Note that they do use a lot of rice in their rolls$LABEL$4
I've never had sushi before$LABEL$4
I was looking for a new sushi spot$LABEL$2
The food is delicious. 5 starsThey have pictures of their different menu items: 5 starsThe service is OK. 3 starsThe atmosphere seems dirty (and dirty tables don't get cleaned right away) 0 stars$LABEL$3
This place is unsuspecting$LABEL$4
When you love your clothes$LABEL$4
When my favorite silk blouse had a run-in with a particularly evil soap dispenser$LABEL$5
Dry-cleaning is a no-brainer operation so I can say that part is fine.  But I had a spot of coffee on my white winter coat and brought it here for dry-cleaning and pointed out the spot and asked if they could treat it.  I get the coat back and the spot is still there$LABEL$3
In terms of dry cleaning I don't require much.  Be quick$LABEL$3
I don't trust Eden Cleaners. I used their online service to pick up my laundry. For three days no one called or picked up the clothes. After several calls$LABEL$1
I went to this cleaner for convenience. What a mistake it was. They absolutely destroyed my favorite dress. It went in perfectly fine and came out pink! The woman told me it was not her problem and that they weren't a magic shop! Absolutely terrible service. I have had the dress cleaned before with absolutely no problem. Use at your own risk.$LABEL$1
City Tavern is an attractive restaurant in the heart of uptown Charlotte. They boast a nice menu with a great seafood selection$LABEL$2
I visited Charlotte and decided to go here$LABEL$2
Very conveniently located at the top of the Blue Line$LABEL$4
Checked this place out while on vacation. They had pretty decent food but the atmosphere was very chain restaurant like. But great beer!$LABEL$3
Looking for the perfect Mojito???  Well look no further!    Rock Bottom has by far the tastiest Pinapple Mojitos.   I stop by Rock Bottom atleast once each time I am in the Charlotte area.    What brings me here? The mojitos and the apple bread pudding.  The steaks$LABEL$4
Our first time visit today. Food was very good and service was great. !$LABEL$4
I'd have to say it was no where near an awesome experience. We tried to order a pitcher of the IPA and the waitress stops us and is like do you like IPAS? do you know what your ordering? i was like yes i like IPAS im capable of ordering a beer like a grown up. maybe next time be like hey our ipa is exceptionally hoppy compared to other ipas$LABEL$2
This is almost directly across the street from The Fox and Hound...and suffers not a whit in comparison! Huge menu$LABEL$4
This place was great! Their menu is HUGE - which can be a good and bad thing. Good if you know what you want. Bad if you're totally indecisive like me. =) There is such a big variety$LABEL$4
Nothing here really blew me away..  Yeah$LABEL$2
Rock Bottom Brewery has a great location and huge space$LABEL$3
You'll know when you've hit it.(Ba-dum crash!)$LABEL$4
Nicest patio downtown. There are much better wait staff downtown. Get the beer or wine. Stay away from cocktails. Food = pedestrian.$LABEL$3
Beer! Free parking! Great place to have some good brew. Great bar food.$LABEL$4
Rock Bottom probably has one of the best locations in uptown. Right on Tryon St. with a large dining area and excellent patio for people watching or watching the cars go by.I don't remember what I ordered I think it was some sort of BBQ chicken and ribs. The food was pretty average$LABEL$3
Great location downtown Charlotte$LABEL$5
A disappointing experience! I have been to Rock Bottom several times before this trip. The pizza always seemed decent and the microbrews were okay too. Nothing special$LABEL$2
Ate here on a Saturday night for a friend's birthday. We had a party of approx. 10 people. We were seated in the back corner and given plenty of space for our party which was nice$LABEL$2
I went to the famed Rock Bottom the other night$LABEL$3
My coworkers brought me here for my b-day lunch and the restaurant was aight.  Since it was pouring outside$LABEL$3
This place has a fantastic outdoor patio and makes for a great place to sip back and enjoy a few beers. We split the brewer's feast and particularly enjoyed the southwest egg rolls with a roasted jalapeno ranch dressing. I enjoyed their winter seasonal and their Sweet Magnolia brown ale. However$LABEL$2
Meh$LABEL$2
My boyfriend and I went here hoping for better-than-average bar food and a good home brew while in Charlotte$LABEL$2
This place has a decent menu$LABEL$2
I have been to this place in the past before they remodeled.  I enjoyed it.  I like the fact they brew their own beer on site.  You can tour the facility when there is time.  They are introducing new menu items and I was able to preview the new items.  I really enjoyed them. I will definitely have to go back.$LABEL$4
I have been here on numerous occasions with a variety of people and the one thing I must say about this place is inconsistency.  You can go there one night and have great food and service$LABEL$2
I recently visited Charlotte this past weekend for the race and needed a casual good food experience. I reviewed Yelp but most of the Downtown spots were noted as dressy or trendy attire establishments. From a 5 hour ride most of us were just comfortable in jeans and tees so nothing to dapper. The concierge at the hotel recommended the Rock Bottom so we gave it a shot. The place was excellent with its open air styling and the drinks were on spot. We ordered the southwest eggrolls as a app and started to order another plate of them and then we remembered we had more food coming! They were that good. I ordered the 14 Ribye with bourbonzola topping. Couldnt have been a more delicious and tender piece of meat. . The seaon veggies and chedder mash were no second. Everything on my plate could not have been anybetter. Check it out . It was worth the visit. And the house brews seemed to hit the spot with the guys that were with me.$LABEL$5
We came on a Thursday and ordered the beer sampler and Southwest egg rolls. - Happy hour extended! Great Waitress! It ended at 630 but she was kind enough to let it slide. - Egg rolls taste more like a flauta. - Sample 6 beers. 3rd one is too hoppy. 1st and last are the best. good deal for $7. - Lots of TVs. Big party friendly.- Just like SD and SJ.$LABEL$4
Location hurts this place. It's fun to sit outside and watch what North Tryon has to offer the first couple times going here$LABEL$3
Oh man oh man! Another review$LABEL$3
I have mixed feelings about Rock Bottom. I enjoyed the inexpensive beer sampler. The main reason we went  here though was for my fiance to try a specific burger. Unfortunately that burger was \""86'd\""... as was her second choice. We weren't told that until 10 to 15 minutes after ordering$LABEL$2
The ONLY reason this place gets two stars and not one is because our server was fantastic: he split our bills no problem$LABEL$2
Good beer$LABEL$3
They've remodeled the inside of the restaurant and it looks great! The beer is great and the service really good. The food is overpriced. It's good food$LABEL$3
A very nice brewpub - a recent and extensive renovation provides great atmosphere.  Blue cheese bacon burger was excellent.  Their brews are very well balanced and enjoyable - something on tap for everyone.$LABEL$4
I like bottom but I like there older menu better. For example I miss the sausage meatloaf vs the new turkey one they replaced it with. Doesn't wow me like the other did. They lose a star with this updated menu.$LABEL$3
I never go uptown just to eat here$LABEL$4
I wasn't impressed with this place. The menu sounds really great& the waitress suggested I get the chicken bacon Mac & cheese$LABEL$2
Go here if you enjoy waiting in the lobby when there are tons of open tables and being rudely treated by the hostess!  The food is just ok bar food.  The beer is awesome I will admit and the servers are pretty attentive.  I would rather drive down to Myrtle beach or Atlanta to it's sister restaurant Gordon Biersch.  The food is much better and the people who work there will treat you much better.  If you really need to go there to enjoy the beer$LABEL$2
Visited Rock Bottom at about 4:45 on a Saturday.  Was surprised at how busy they were but we were still able to be seated quickly in a large comfortable booth overlooking the street.I started with the Summer Honey Ale.  Meh.  I think I was expecting a bit more of a sweet/honey flavor.  I wish I had tried one of their other beers.  It comes in a large glass (I think bigger than a typical pint serving).I had the stuffed poblano peppers.  I was curious (dubious?) so I asked my server.  She said that the filling is awesome and that the bites with the peppers had a kick.  She was spot on.  I really enjoyed the cheesey$LABEL$3
Service is great. Outside seating in mild weather is awesome. Chicken Mac and Sausage Mac were both great. Veggie pizza was fresh and yummy. Beer sampler was fun to try!$LABEL$4
Their beers are really good$LABEL$2
Food was good$LABEL$4
The food was rock bottom. It was so disappointing that  me and two my friends could not finish our meals.$LABEL$1
Great lunch!  Sat at the bar - busy spot - they have lots of take out orders.Bartender do an ok job keeping up.Salad was delish!  A little too much arugula$LABEL$4
Visiting from out of town we happen to walk upon this place. The food was good and the service was great. The menu itself has a lot for everyone. We did sample the beer it was good just a bit warm for my taste.$LABEL$4
Great food & craft beer.My husband is a craft beer guy and he loved the 6 he tried. I went for the food$LABEL$4
A cool place to hang out in downtown.  The food.is very good.  You cannot go wrong with the fish and chips.  I enjoy the beer.  Most of beers are brewed on site.  The only problem is the staff turns over very quickly.  Parking is free if you park in the deck under the restaurant.   Make sure yo ger your ticket validated.   Sign up for the rewards card.  It is not nearly as good as the previous perks card$LABEL$4
FiNALLY! A restaurant in Charlotte that makes up for all the bad ones. Their burgers are to die for. BEST BURGER IN CHARLOTTE! I had the Bacon Mac N Cheese which was really good but wow...my husband had the bourbonzola burger and it was delicious. The appetizers are good too plus if you go to the Blumenthal Center for the Performing Arts and take your show ticket you get a free appetizer!This is one of my new favorite places! Thank you$LABEL$5
first off$LABEL$2
Beer - Many choices and micro-brews (I dont drink beer$LABEL$3
We went for lunch on Sunday Afternoon.  We sat there for ten minutes and nobody acknowledged us or came to our table.  A waitress passed our table two times and chose not to make eye contact with us.  Servers congregated at the hostess stand.  We walked out and still nobody noticed.  This used to be my favorite place uptown.  Really disappointed.$LABEL$1
Went here for a bachelorette party of 12 girls$LABEL$2
After two recent visits here$LABEL$2
Bad service and mediocre food served cold.  If you have a large group and want to get together for lunch you would be better off bringing a bag lunch and meeting in a park.  We made reservations but it took 30 minutes for our order to be taken and the food didn't show until an hour later at which point we all had to get back to work. And$LABEL$1
My girlfriend and I were part of a friend's birthday party of about 12 adults on a Thursday night. It was not especially crowded (no wait) and we had reservations.1. Nobody took our drink orders or brought us water for over 20minutes.2. When they brought out all the appetizers$LABEL$1
Went last night with in-laws for mother in laws bday.We always have loved the place and it is our go to place when we have something to celebrate and even when we don't.  Walked right in$LABEL$2
If I could design the perfect all-around restaurant$LABEL$5
This place wasn't bad.  If you live in Charlotte and have tried the other local beers in the area$LABEL$3
I have been to several Rock Bottoms including Denver$LABEL$2
The beer was pretty good$LABEL$2
This place was great for atmosphere and large groups but the food actually sucked.  We ordered from the happy hour appetizer menu and our server was pretty slow and forgetful. She brought one of us crab dip that was cold (supposed to be served hot)$LABEL$2
Came in with a buddy of mine to a familiar place that always delivers during my travels. We sat down$LABEL$2
Amazing habanero shrimp appetizer$LABEL$5
Lately this has been Sunday football watching spot for my friends and I. We normally occupy one of the long bar table in front of 4 TVs (3 more on the other side) for hours. With that being said$LABEL$4
Very good beer and food + a truly relaxing and comfortable setting = four stars. Prices were OK and the location is great if you are in or near center-city CLT. I had the Cajun Pasta & my wife had grilled shrimp with Mac/Cheese. YUM!$LABEL$4
First time here$LABEL$1
Food is good$LABEL$4
This place Was horrible!!! The steak was over cooked and tough$LABEL$1
I recently attended a wedding at the Charlotte City Club and it was gorgeous! Not only is it a beautiful venue with a fabulous view$LABEL$4
The place is kind of a maze. If you're wanting a party it's not ideal$LABEL$3
Don't Get Married Here. My husband and I got married in July. We had sit down dinner and chose 3 meals for our guests to choose from. The Filet which was the most expensive came out raw to about half the guests who ordered it. I had 2 guests told they were out of their meal and had to pick something else even though I payed for it. The event manager who I worked with the whole year stepped back the night of and gave it to the banquet manger who I never met and knew nothing about us or our wedding. Coffee and dessert was never announced and when we asked for it to be they said they would but still didn't and by the time we realized it was too late. That was $2000 down the drain. We bought sparklers for the end of the night send off and when my mother in law asked for a second one the man handing them out wouldn't give it to her even though we payed for them. It is now 2 months later and we have been emailing with the event manager since to get some kind of resolution. But he keeps shooing us away. They don't seem to care that we spent a ton of money her as they are ala cart. I would have liked not as many issues as this was my first wedding. So here is to all the Bride's. This place is beautiful but not worth the money$LABEL$2
This fast food place almost ALWAYS gets my order wrong. They charge me for things that they don't have. The lettuces on the garden salad is always weltered. Besides the staff being EXTREMELY unprofessional$LABEL$1
Now$LABEL$4
David Wichnoski is the best.  I woke up a few months ago with swollen eyes and since I don't wear contacts or glasses (and hadn't seen an eye Dr in many years) I was freaking out.  They squeezed me in when my original Dr refused to.  I have since been going to him for regular exams.  I highlyg recommend Spectrum Eye Care to anyone in the Charlotte area.  If you work downtown$LABEL$5
I recently visited this eye doctor after moving to the area$LABEL$5
Much like the others that have reivewed this location and business I agree regarding their superb customer care and overall handling of my appointment.  There was no wait regarding my eye exam.  I was brought back within 5 minutes and once into the room it might have been 1-2 minutes before the optometrist showed up to begin my glasses and contact fitting exam.Once out of the room and back into the actual showroom I was greeted by the nice young lady out front (I think her name was Jackie).  She was more than helpful by way of using her knowledge of my healthcare eye plan to give me my best option regarding the purchases I wanted to make that day.Literally one of the best eye exams and overall sales experience I've ever had.$LABEL$5
I got the fried rice with beef$LABEL$2
Excellent food and good portions for the price.$LABEL$5
Their food is made of magic.$LABEL$5
A friend at work was having a bad day$LABEL$4
well well well (please push me in)I remember (as everyone else has stated) back in the day when this was the spot. \""Dot\"" (the owner) is/was a Church member of Community Outreach Christian Ministries and after \""chuch\"" we would make our way.. as soon as se would see me.. Heyyyyy baaaby!!yep.. please give me... BAKED CHICKEN (1/4)$LABEL$2
The sanitation score for this place was 93.0.....I guess that was a red flag that I missed before I placed my order.I will start with the 'good'. The cashier was very polite$LABEL$2
Borderline sanitation. Delicious food. Collards. Mac 'n cheese. Meatloaf. Obama tea.$LABEL$4
Ok.. Maybe I went here at the wrong time or something but I have to put in my two cents.  This is not a really cool hang out.  The bar is really small and the staff was really unfriendly.  I went around 5pm on a Tuesday$LABEL$2
My husband and I had the most awesome experience at Prestos our waiter Alex and Alaina were the best they suggested the shrimp & grits and the chicken martini and both were great! We will definently be back thanks for a great dining experience.$LABEL$5
Went here while visiting my sister in Charlotte.......and it was decent enough. Staff was friendly$LABEL$3
Definitely A-OK.  It has been several years since we had been here$LABEL$3
I came here for lunch during work.  The food was decent but 2 issues$LABEL$2
My husband and I went to Presto on a Tuesday night around 6:30. It was very$LABEL$1
We stopped in here for Dinner and it must have been an off night for them. I ordered a coke when it came it was very watered down. I commented to the waiter about the coke and his curt reply was \""I know$LABEL$2
Eh.. I had the chicken alfredo; the noodles were hard$LABEL$2
Great service$LABEL$1
OK$LABEL$2
Restaurant dot com you've let me down once again. I've got to ask myself why do I keep doing this. I guess the good restaurants don't have to use coupons. To be fair we ordered the three steak options on the menu$LABEL$1
I'm simply not a fan of this place and don't plan on going back so let me explain why... Last fall$LABEL$1
I went to this place on a weekend visit to Charlotte. Don't know why we chose this place out of all the other visually appealing places around. (/from the outside$LABEL$3
Very poor service. Unremarkable at best.$LABEL$1
I had lunch at China King.  It's pretty standard Chinese place.  The restaurant was pretty full.  The food is not made to order$LABEL$3
I've been  back to China King a couple of times now since my initial visit.  I came earlier around 11 to 11:30 is and it was not busy at all.  I ordered off their specials menu$LABEL$4
Tasty$LABEL$3
I've been here quite a few times since i started working uptown. I usually get the sesame chicken and rice$LABEL$2
Seafood Noodle soup had slices of pork. The cilantro garnish wasn't even chopped.$LABEL$1
Look$LABEL$3
I did some research$LABEL$2
Summary:  Beautiful hotel$LABEL$2
It's a Westin$LABEL$3
I stayed at the Westin (3 nights/4 days)$LABEL$4
We recently stayed a Saturday night and I thought that the place was not very well organized... Our room had plastic cups$LABEL$2
Westin is a chain$LABEL$2
I absolutely hate this place. Not for the amenities as they are undoubtedly the best in the business$LABEL$1
This hotel is fantastic. I won't stay any where else while on business in Charlotte. The rooms are modern$LABEL$4
It is amazing to me that they always seem to have a concierge on duty but they are very content to let us wait for 20 minutes to check-in or out.  I started staying here for business because I liked the design but i am constantly disappointed with the service.  It took me three tries and 10 minutes on hold to confirm my room for an additional night (all while I was running a meeting of 20 people).  The only group in that hotel that seems to have it together is the valet's.  If only it didn't take me as long to check out as to drive from the hotel to the airport.$LABEL$2
How can you go wrong with Heavenly Bed and Heavenly Baths? I loved this place!!! If only I could afford to stay here again!$LABEL$5
First$LABEL$1
Beautiful lounge downstairs that doubles as a lobby/workspace and hotel bar. Great place to work$LABEL$4
Exactly what you would expect from a Westin property. Nice decor$LABEL$4
My recommendation? DO NOT STAY HERE if you have a choice. Depressing atmosphere and the staff is predominantly untrained and non-English-speaking. Room service extraordinarily expensive$LABEL$2
Don't waste your time staying here if you are a business traveler. The Internet is awful and they don't support iPhone or iPad So many better options around$LABEL$1
I stayed three nights at the Westin with a group for a conference. The staff was courteous in all of my interactions with them$LABEL$2
This hotel is so swanky! It looks so cool outside with their chic building design$LABEL$1
Stayed here for about 3 days since there was a conference going on.I would say it is in a pretty nice location.  Located at the end of Uptown (?)$LABEL$4
I've been to better Sheratons and what hotel sends staff to knock on the door at 8:30pm telling me that I'm playing my banjo too loudly.  Never happened before and I'm in the thick of bluegrass country.$LABEL$2
I really looked forward to writing a good review based on my first initial impression$LABEL$3
Stayed here while working the NASCAR race at the nearby Charlotte Motor Speedway. I'm glad the room was paid for by the company$LABEL$3
Hubby and I like to hang out in Charlotte on the weekends$LABEL$4
I went to an event lasy night at the Westin Hotel$LABEL$1
I wanted to give it three stars because the lobby was so great$LABEL$2
In Charlotte for  conference.  Everyone has been incredibly nice$LABEL$4
Okay$LABEL$1
There are much better choices in uptown Charlotte!  Let me start with the good...the front desk staff. The three people who assisted me at the front desk were extremely friendly and helpful. Great customer service!Now the bad...stains. There is no other way to describe everything in my room. Multiple stains on the carpeting and the comforter. The bathrobe hanging on the back of the bathroom door had a huge brown stain on the sleeve that I kept telling myself was makeup from the last occupant. Every$LABEL$2
I've actually been here at least 3 or 4 times now and it's fine. It's a Westin. Pretty consistent as a chain in my opinion. Been to about half a dozen now and they all seem to match up pretty evenly more or less. A solid option before you leap up the prices to luxury status. That said$LABEL$3
An architectural site$LABEL$4
Clean hotel$LABEL$4
I've stayed here for four years in a row and this go around have noticed a serious decline in service and quality.  There was only one employee available to check people in and after a full day I waited 30 minutes to check in.  As a result$LABEL$2
It's the Westin! It's Uptown! I just KNEW I was going to be amazed....and I was not. Perhaps my expectations were just wayyyy to high. But for me everything was just very blah. The staff were all pleasant enough$LABEL$3
Fantastic views from the suites were a highlight for us here$LABEL$4
One word \""heavenly\"" beds. Need I say more. I'm a fan of Westin everywhere I travel. The beds alone make it a good stay. This location is ideal$LABEL$4
Need a place in Charlotte to get black out drunk without fear of waking up missing vital organs? Than the Westin Charlotte is the place for you. Was witness to an amateur drunk who passed out. Rather than doing the typical bounce and toss the staff gave genuine care and concern to the help him through the this moment of self reflection. One employee went so far as to ice his neck in hope to help him sober up$LABEL$5
A beautiful hotel with accommodating staff and good amenities. The catering is splendid. The food is fresh and REALLY good! I don't need to say anymore than what has been said about the beds. Just the best there is. Bathrooms are modern and clean. Charlotte's beauty can be seen out my window. Stay here!$LABEL$4
***The Westin Charlotte has a great location in Downtown Charlotte (within walking distance to so many key Charlotte attractions) and the hotel is contemporary and comfortable***While I mostly stay at Marriott hotels$LABEL$4
I can only speak from the experience of staying here for a recent convention. Several conferees and I had issues with the staff during the event over displays and services. Due to the nature of the event (romance novelists and readers) I got the impression they hovered close in case we decided to cause trouble. I did not find the venue pleasant.While my room was clean$LABEL$1
I was a manager at a six-star hotel with 2$LABEL$3
Great location for someone new to the city. Your right in the middle of it all! Within walking distance of Charlotte's great bars & restaurants. The staff was very accommodating.$LABEL$4
Ehhhh...not so much.While the building$LABEL$1
The Good:This place is in a pretty prime location downtown as it is located to some of the best eateries downtown (Merts$LABEL$2
been traveling a lot lately and this was one of our stops.  we booked the aloft W down the street and those posers$LABEL$3
I stayed at the Holiday Inn Center City for 7nights while on a business trip.  My room was okay$LABEL$4
If my life were more like a rapper's and less like a graduate student$LABEL$3
Quite possibly the most miserable hotel experience of my life. noisy$LABEL$1
I stay in 3 to 4 hotel rooms a week so I am not too picky when it comes to beds but these were terrible. If I'm going to pay $160/night I at least want a decent bed. And this may sound weird but the toilet seats were too small (and I'm a small guy). The rooms were clean but I would not stay here again.$LABEL$2
We had a great experience here:  helpful staff$LABEL$4
AWFUL!! i booked a hotel room here for New Years Eve and was not told that it was a non-refundable pre-paid hotel room! 1 month after i booked the room and 1 month before I was staying there my credit card was charged for the room!  I was treated like an idiot by Carmen who answered the phone.  She kept saying that I should have known but I would not have been so upset if I had known the hotel could charge my card any time they wanted!!  Make sure whoever you speak to tells you everything when booking a room!!  Would not recommed this hotel solely based on the way I have been treated!!!$LABEL$1
I stayed at this particular holiday inn last week  If you check my previous reviews I always stay in a holiday inn or candlewood when I travel (IHG brand).  While 9 out of 10 are good experiences this one takes the cake.  Based on yelp reviews we knew ahead of time about the parking fee (it is unavoidable in the center of the city)At least it is only a 1 time fee and they validate it for your stay.  After parking we go to hotel lobby to check in and were greeted by a very nice and helpful receptionist (I wish I remembered her name).  She told us that we had the best room in the entire hotel$LABEL$5
The staff at this hotel are all so attentive and efficient. Look you guys.... I'm accustomed to to rouging it since I'm on the road so much and this is Not that.From the accommodating Front Desk Staff$LABEL$4
Steer clear of this hotel.  Mediocre rooms but very unpleasant service - they do not honor reservation requests and have nothing but excuses. Bar is way overpriced.  There are MANY choices in Charlotte - do not consider this hotel as one.$LABEL$1
Great hotel - very clean$LABEL$4
Beware of this hotel...  Under renovations until December 30$LABEL$2
Sunday birthday parties are not my favorite thing$LABEL$3
We went on a Friday and it wasn't too busy. We all had a wonderful time until the end. We were in the womens locker room and even though they had a family locker room there were little boys there about 6-7 years old changing in the room too and one walking around with no clothes on. I had my little sister and did not appreciate it at all. When I talked to staff all they asked me was if they had autism? It doesnt chnge anything.Come on there was a family bathroom right there. And they didn't seem too concerned about my complaint. And the bathrooms were nasty. But if you don't use the locker rooms or bathrooms it is good.$LABEL$1
It may sound a little creepy$LABEL$3
As others have mentioned$LABEL$4
When I was a kid$LABEL$3
The \""Main Library\"" recently moved many circulations around and it's hard to find someone who knows where everything is now? I went their recently and finally found a fiction book in the nonfiction after 20 minuted of looking with 2 staff members. Not ideal$LABEL$3
Oh PLCMC Main location--you are an interesting character. While I feel compelled to love you since I visit you every week$LABEL$3
Full o' bums....er...the less fortunate...who camp out inside to either sleep or use the restrooms to bathe in. Plenty of other sketchy people who don't look like they're there to read. If perverts had a chip implanted in them$LABEL$2
Nothing spectacular. Hard to find some items. Nice atmosphere and environment. More of a selection of course$LABEL$3
My second home. Hands down$LABEL$4
I like to think of myself as an appreciater of art.  I've loved the Museum of Modern Art in New York City$LABEL$1
My daughter will be leaving Queens after this spring.  I feel like we were duped.  The school is a publicity machine with nothing behind it.  The students have no sense of community$LABEL$1
If you are in this building and in the need of a quick cup of coffee$LABEL$3
The staff here is SO friendly$LABEL$5
Forget about Starbucks. Coming from Miami for a business meeting I stopped here. These are the friendliest people you can find and the coffee is the best. It was a refreshing experience.$LABEL$5
I love this place. I come to Charlotte all the time for work and always stay at the nearby Hilton. They have SO many kinds of coffee/tea and always have fresh bananas (my breakfast of choice!) The staff is so nice and friendly too- always cheers me up!$LABEL$5
Facility OK.  Shipping is horrible.  Bring on the Brown.  While the place is OK for copies and such$LABEL$1
Obviously the greatest part of this place are the hours and availability if you are in a pinch and live uptown and need to get something shipped out.  They even have greeting cards if you need a quick birthday card shipped out.  The interior is nice and clean and supplies are neatly and well kept.  The staff couldn't be nicer$LABEL$3
I totally agree with you that Time Warner Cable has one of the worst customer service I have come across.  Sorry for the comment.  They may be the only service provider in this area that they do not care or the employees have not been paid enough that they do not care about their job.I signed up as they knocked at my door.  Like someone said$LABEL$1
TW is relatively new to Fort Mill/Indian Land but when they arrived$LABEL$4
Time Warner over AT&T any day of the year...$LABEL$4
I was a customer for approx 16 yrs.  Only because they were my only option.  Came home one day to find out they had cut off my service because I had a balance of $28.00.  It was gonna be $150 and 2 wks before I could get it turned back on.  Needless$LABEL$1
Time Warner Cable is awful.  I really recommend looking elsewhere for your cable/internet before choosing them.I have had nothing but issues with my cable and internet since I had them$LABEL$1
Well money talks so they talked me into giving them another try.  Well$LABEL$1
UGH!  Worst service ever!!!  We kept having issues with our wireless where it would go out sporatically so we called up TW and they sent out a service person to take a look.  First of all$LABEL$1
The Yelp title under 2 stars is$LABEL$2
One star reviews do not happen often for me$LABEL$1
This is for Time Warner Cable as a whole:FOR SHAME!The house next door is a rental. Everytime somebody moves out and has their cable disconnected$LABEL$1
I haven't had any problems with my internet$LABEL$2
I was offered internet sufficient to stream video for $29.99$LABEL$1
When I drafted this review$LABEL$4
I feel like nothing beats Road Runner for speed so I guess that is the only reason I stay with them. Other than that$LABEL$3
Terrible customer service.  I wanted to change my services$LABEL$1
Wish I could give TWC zero stars. They have billed me wrong consistently for 4 months straight$LABEL$1
I dislike TWC.  I searched online for drop-off locations and found several; however$LABEL$1
I am typing this as I wait on hold AGAIN for the second day in a row$LABEL$1
TWC is the worst cable company I've ever dealt with. Each time I've called for Tech Support I was on hold for at least an hour. Their only response is to unplug the box.  I'm on my 2nd DVR box in 2 months & channels go out randomly.  If you can get cable somewhere else do it!$LABEL$1
This is my first TWC experience as I relocated from out of state.  It is by far the WORST service provider experience I've ever experienced in my life.  I had to call 3 separate times @ 30 mins each to start an account.  The first 2 times they were cancelled automatically after I called because the \""current tenant\"" in the apartment hadn't put in a turn off request yet.  No one called or emailed me$LABEL$1
I have tried repeatedly to get this company to refund an incorrect amount charged to my mother who died.  There is no email and I have spent hours on the phone.  USE any other service if you can.$LABEL$1
Time Warner Cable is an incompetent company that runs a monopoly on internet services in certain neighborhoods.  They will enroll you in bill pay$LABEL$1
I do not like this company! For years I have been forced to work with them for Internet and cable and have been consistently dissatisfied with the customer service. Inconsistent billing$LABEL$1
My wife and I have always liked the cable repair personnel but the customer service has always been the biggest joke- wrong departments$LABEL$1
This is for Time Warner as a company$LABEL$1
Well$LABEL$1
TW raised my internet rates twice in 18 months and called it \""a discount\$LABEL$2
After years of outages$LABEL$1
After Time Warner Cable raised my internet rates again with no improved service$LABEL$1
I wish there were zero stars. I had TWC for several years and they were always a pain. Internet service was shoddy$LABEL$1
It is the first time I gave 1-rated review$LABEL$1
The drop off process for returning your cable box is ridiculous. It's as tedious as waiting at the DMV. I don't understand why Time Warner can't pick up the box$LABEL$1
Prepare for a LONG wait$LABEL$1
Worse customer service ever.When I got up yesterday$LABEL$1
If you want crappy customer service$LABEL$1
BAD CUSTOMER SERVICE$LABEL$1
I love how they just sent me a letter to inform me about their price increase while saying I am still enjoying their special promotion.....I have been a customer for the past 7 years$LABEL$1
The worst place on earth. Lines are ridiculous no matter what time you arrive$LABEL$1
What a joke of a company. Absolutely horrible customer service and it infuriates me that I pay these rates for a product/service that continues to experience \""outages\"" and I cant even  watch the channels I want  to.  An absolute horrible company and it upsets me every month that I pay them for \""service\"" because there is not another cable provider in my area.$LABEL$1
Hahaha....I don't even know what type of review to write. Let me start off by saying I've had TW for about 4 months and cancelled my services TODAY! (And it felt awesome) I now have AT&T U-verse :) I almost never write reviews but today I will. Customer Service: sucks! I waited and waited and waited and waited....before I actually was able to talk to someone who could assist me with ONE of my problems.Bills: I recieved a $400+ bill before (and I only have one tv in my small studio apartment) needless to say my soul left my body for 10 seconds when I saw the bill...I'm a struggling law student$LABEL$1
I had an AMAZING dinner at Ratcliffe on the Green with my gf's parents.  None of us had been there before$LABEL$5
I've been meaning to post this since my last experience there$LABEL$2
Just took advantage of Uptown Restaurant Week and had dinner here with my sister. The Restaurant week menu came with three courses$LABEL$5
Ok so I finally dined here and lets say disappointing wasn't even the word...if I'm going to be dropping a large sum of money down I want it to be on food that I actually enjoyed! I went a few weeks ago and we opted for the three course Chef's Tasting menu...well lets just say if these dishes were a reflection of any chef well they truly shouldn't be one right down to the presentations!! For my first course i had the \""Baked Beans\"" as we called it not at all what I expected to get and  barely any Duck Confit in it as it said on the menu very boring and missing lots of flavors so yes they tasted and looked like Baked Beans. Then second course I had the Tomato with goat cheese and peas I had one bite and did not go back for another. The plate was filled with tomato liquid and the goat cheese was running right in it  YUCK is all I have to say!! Then finally our last course MY favorite is Rack of Lamb so of course I'm now anticipating my Lamb I had asked for it to be cooked Rare/Medium Rare just in case they were to over cook it. WELL sure enough it came out Medium Well...Now i would have sent it back but my friend had ordered his steak Medium Well and got his Rare so i didnt want to be that table that sent everything back....Only good thing about this place was my company. it is outdated they may want to rethink they're concept AGAIN and possibly add a few woman servers in there to bring some life to this place!! Finally this place was stale like the bread!!$LABEL$1
...and they're closed.  Couldn't have happened to a more deserving group of people.  Found out the chef that told me he was the owner was NOT the owner.  Found out he left less than a month after this incident.  The restaurant closed less than four months after that.  Good riddance!$LABEL$1
David Parks is an amazing massage therapist!!!I was visiting from out of town and needed a massage.  I was staying at a hotel nearby and knew Modern Salon from when I lived in the area before.  I called up and they got me in right away.  I walked in$LABEL$5
If you work uptown$LABEL$5
I was in town for a wedding this past weekend. I forgot to pack my heavy duty equipment to style my hair$LABEL$5
A bumpy first experience with Modern$LABEL$3
I really wanted this place to be a HIT......but instead it was more of  a #FAIL. I'm sure that it was because I was booked with a NEWBIE right out of school and her first week in the Salon. So I would give this salon a second chance but book with someone with more expertise. The hair stylist was a sweet girl right out of school was I knew was trying so hard. My Trim & Partial High Lights took 3 1/2 hours though!! Additionally the highlights came out very blocky and with some leopard stripes. The color was not put all the way to the roots so I walked out with ROOTS and a $200 bill.  I told the stylist a few times the issues at hand but each time she started crying and I didn't have the heart to pursue the issue. Disappointed that I walked out with roots when I went in there to get a touch up. When I got down to the parking garage and my \""validated ticket\"" had only been validated for 1/2 the time and I had to spend another $20 to leave the garage. The Manager heard that was I was unhappy with the new girls attempt and sent me a gift card to their salon. A very nice follow up and great recovery. So I would say$LABEL$2
I recently moved to Charlotte and have been looking for a good Aveda salon. I googled locations near my office and found Modern Salon. I was able to get an appointment the day of with a junior stylist. I saw Laura and she gave me an amazing hair cut for $36 (excluding tip). I have to admit$LABEL$5
This place is awesome and Gabby did a great job giving me the best haircut of my life!  Pay the extra few bucks to go here rather than get a sub par cut someplace else! Well worth it!$LABEL$5
I waited a few months to review because my experience was so bad$LABEL$1
I was in town for a family wedding$LABEL$5
I had Modern Salon and Spa Uptown do my wedding party's hair.  Our hair and make up turned out ok but we felt that we were way over charged.  I had one bridesmaids who was in the chair less than 20 minutes and recieved a curled pony tail.  She was charged $85.00.  Nobody at the salon could understand why we were upset.   I would not reccomend having your wedding party go to Modern...$LABEL$2
Ultimately$LABEL$3
This place is great to host any big event.  I worked the Charlotte Motorcycle Show this weekend and everything was very organized the staff at the Convention Center is friendly and there is plenty of places to park near by.  Vending machines$LABEL$3
Man$LABEL$4
I travel to quite a few conventions$LABEL$2
Like any large city$LABEL$3
What can you really say about a convention center - I have been to a few now - so I think it's fair to say that this is one of the cleanest$LABEL$3
The Convention Center is nestled right in the heart of Uptown.Parking is a little sketchy$LABEL$3
Was here recently for the HRC NC Gala Dinner and I must say I was impressed.  Large$LABEL$3
Not bad$LABEL$3
Large enough for any event. I should have wandered around more to learn all the exit/ entry points so I can have better ideas where to park.  It can be a hassle finding a spot$LABEL$3
The Convention Center needs better souvenir store/vendor. Everything looked old and used. Not a lot of souvenirs to pick. Poor souvenir  store. Need major improvement.$LABEL$2
I had my first experience at the Charlotte Convention Center just a few weeks ago. And I gotta say it was a solid 4 star time. The convention center is generally easy to get to$LABEL$4
We just had fifty high school students interview here and it was a great location.  Kind of a ghost town because it's so large$LABEL$4
It's a Residence Inn$LABEL$2
Booked the penthouse for a night on the town$LABEL$2
Great location$LABEL$5
Good location. Terrible front desk staff & way over priced. The front desk staff was not interested in helping me checkin. She kept answering the phone even though others were there. We had an issue as when I booked via my phone it didn't say there was a $75 fee for a pet. We left. Made a one night stay $325. Ummm you are a Marriott not the Ritz$LABEL$2
I am still sad that Border's is closing... it was my favorite \""big box\"" style   bookstore. But my second choice for mega-bookstores has always been the B&N store at the Arbo.  Even though they don't offer the same variety of games$LABEL$3
I'll have to step out of the shadows here and say that while I do like B&N and Borders$LABEL$3
Decided to spend the afternoon at B&N since my boyfriend was looking for a new read.. Sunday$LABEL$3
If it wasn't for the shady characters in and out of this place I would give it a 4 star...no doubt.  Not much to say here$LABEL$3
Salsarita's is a great place to grab a quick lunch while in a hurry. They've got tasty tacos$LABEL$3
This is a great place and the people are the friendliest. I really enjoy their food. It is always fresh. I would recommend this restaurant to anyone. The management is the best!$LABEL$5
Quick Casual Mexican food might be the best way to challenge your intestines during your 2pm meeting.Salsaritas consistently delivers decent quality offerings.  The most surprising thing about this particular location is their ability to turn over the sheer volume that they do.  You walk by the line out the door at the lunch time rush and think 'no way am I waiting in line for that...' but low and behold$LABEL$3
The concept is typical - fast Mexican with a build your own food walk akin to Qdoba$LABEL$5
Another Uptown location that understands foot traffic. (I mention that because there are some that never seem to have enough workers. I guess trying to save a penny.)  There's always a lunch rush line and this visit no exception. However$LABEL$4
Knowing my love for Salsarita's on Rea Road$LABEL$4
Yikes... as much as I frequent this place$LABEL$4
We popped in here for lunch on a Saturday morning and were pleasantly surprised.  We arrived after their official breakfast hours$LABEL$4
It has become one of my favorites when catching a show at the Blumenthal.  The food is quite good.  The service can be sketchy.  Eat outside when the weather permits.$LABEL$4
The Monticello is a great place to have a civilized breakfast.  They have fresh-squeezed orange juice$LABEL$4
My soon-to-be-Mother-in-law loves the Dunhill$LABEL$4
My first meal as a Charlottean was had at this establishment.  I had a taste for fish$LABEL$2
\""Every Christmas Story Ever Told\"" was slow and not that funny. Spoiled by comedy and improv options in bigger cities$LABEL$2
Plucky shows$LABEL$4
I didn't know this theater existed until I went to see their run of the Rocky Horror Show.  It's a great pace with an intimate feel and a good seating layout.  There really isn't a bad seat in the house (unless you have vision/hearing problems).  The beer and wine selection at their concession has much more variety than I expected and their box office is a breeze to deal with.  Seriously$LABEL$5
I have been to the Actor's Theatre for several productions now$LABEL$4
I went on Friday$LABEL$5
If not for the Yelp Elite event this past week$LABEL$3
I'm glad that a YELP event brought me here. The theater is small and feels really comfortable.Parking is bountiful and free! Yes$LABEL$4
Bar Charlotte is a place where golddiggers go to listen to pop rap and find sugar daddies.  There is a huge dancefloor in the center of the bar with sweaty eighteen year olds bumping and grinding on one another$LABEL$1
In the same (horrible) vein as the next door Have A Nice Day$LABEL$1
Came here twice this weekend. Is it worth the $15 cover on Fridays? Not really. I thought it was a bit too much. If you're into seeing old creepy men looking up your skirt$LABEL$2
Wow$LABEL$2
If you're a black male don't go to Bar Charlotte$LABEL$1
I'll try to be objective here. So disclaimer first$LABEL$2
I was banned for life from this bar in the Spring of 2006.$LABEL$1
What a freak show! I walked into this place and I thought to my self WTF? All I saw were a bunch of little people and a swing. Lol. The music was great so we decided to go inside for a look. We were visiting from out of town and browsing the down town scene and what a scene this place was. There were a bunch of staff walking around with animal masks and someone in a monkey suit and a bunch of half-naked bar tenders and for the love of me I couldn't figure out why there were so many short people in the place. Not little people but just short people. Oh yeah and the swing in the corner.Well I had a blast. The music was great and the vibe was great. There were quite a few young people and about 3 men who I thought might have been in their 60's but that was ok because it was cool. It was judgment free. The headless bull in the corner was cool too. The girls dancing on the bar were cool too. If I go back to charlotte I will definitely visit this place again. I  don't know why this place is getting such a low rating.$LABEL$4
The bar itself is good and the servers do a great job but man do the patrons suck! I went once and some guy decided to \""make it rain\"" and started flipping out because dudes were picking up the money. If you're dumb enough to throw a pile of money in to the air you better bet your ass that us broke college kids are going to pick it up! It's also predominantly African American (or at least it was when I went) which is totally fine but some of them looked like gang members. I'm sure I'll get called racist for that but it's the honest truth. I also saw a lot of people getting upset over the dumbest stuff...like getting their shoes stepped on$LABEL$2
My instinct always told me that I should skip this place. Should have listened. It was just gross; literally and figuratively. I was afraid to see what I was stepping on out on the dance floor. Music was good$LABEL$1
Great food$LABEL$5
This was my first time coming to this restaurant and I came because a lot people and media were talking about it. I took my Mom on Sunday for her birthday. The only thing good about our meal was the water$LABEL$1
Nothing will ever be like Grandma Rachel's$LABEL$3
Oooh I loves me some Mert's! When I worked downtown this place was a regular on my list of favorite lunch spots. You can smell it a block away! Amidst all the new fine dining places Charlotte has to offer is this little gem of home cooked greasy goodness.It's hard to recommend any one thing in particular$LABEL$4
I visited Charlotte last week and I ate here three times.  I couldn't help it.  Soul Food is right.  Eating here is like having a spiritual revival meeting in your mouth.  You feel like a better person after having eaten here.  A better person who will die of a massive heart attack in 5 minutes.$LABEL$5
It's OK.  It's soul food.  The fried chicken was straight forward.  Not likely to go back for just that$LABEL$2
Want some authentic Southern soul food without having to drive out of the city into the lands of banjos$LABEL$3
I had high expectations considering that I was in the South.  I love the food in the South!  However the experience here was not very good!  I grew up eating most of the food on the menu$LABEL$2
Let's say someone has been traveling for work a lot. Let's say they end up in Charlotte$LABEL$4
Amazing every time.  Service can be a little slow$LABEL$5
Go to Mert's if you want good southern comfort food!  their cornbread is great and they always have lots of cakes and pies for dessert options.  This place is a Charlotte tradition and if you are visiting town - plan a have at least 1 meal here.$LABEL$4
FFFFANNNNNTAASSSTICCC!!!  Wow$LABEL$5
Traveling on business I was feeling antsy in the hotel room and decided to get out and explore downtown Charlotte last night. I read on a Chowhound article that Mert's was a good place for a solo diner to get some good local food without feeling weird for eating alone$LABEL$3
Excellent BBQ$LABEL$4
Well--after I was done$LABEL$2
Oh wow. I came for brunch and made the mistake of not ordering one of their signature soul food dishes. The chicken n dumplings looked amazing$LABEL$5
Cornbread here is best I've had. BBQ is decent but the fried chicken was soggy and lacked flavor. I've had better in California. Not the best soul food representation for the south.$LABEL$3
We were visiting from San Diego and only in town for one day. Someone recommended Mert's for some good soul food.  Exactly what we were looking for!  The fried green tomatoes and the corn bread were absolutely amazing$LABEL$5
I am so sorry to rate Mert's so poorly but after the treatment received today I must admit to extreme disappointment in one of my previously favorite Charlotte establishments.  After being invited repeatedly via automated email marketing$LABEL$1
Would never go back!  I was in a party of 3 that was seated at a table for 4$LABEL$1
Went here yesterday for dinner. Had the pork chops$LABEL$4
Always friendly$LABEL$5
Food is decent. But$LABEL$3
Wanted to like this place. Staff very friendly. Reasonable prices. Quick service. But plates were dirty. Table dirty. Food just OK.$LABEL$2
Great comfort food!  Really cool find downtown near the train$LABEL$4
I love Mert's.  They have the BEST cornbread I've ever had$LABEL$3
No doubt am I fan. Whether this LBD is craving mac and cheese or collard greens$LABEL$4
What I Ate:Fried Chicken$LABEL$4
By far one of the best soul food restaurants in Charlotte!  Try the red beans/rice and turkey sausage$LABEL$4
SUMMARY:  This was about the 6th time I've dined at Mert's.  First time since joining Yelp.  I was disappointed by the exceptionally long time it took for dinner to be brought to our table and by the terrible version of BBQ they offer.  DETAILS:We were promptly seated and had our drink order taken.  The drinks came right$LABEL$2
Love this place!! Food was great!! Fried whiting-Meaty$LABEL$5
Mert's deserves all of the love it is getting and more. I visit every few months for their awesome beef ribs$LABEL$5
This place serves excellent Low Country/Country Cooking dishes at reasonable prices - at least the prices are reasonable at lunch$LABEL$4
Food was good$LABEL$3
Soul Food gone Gourmet!!!Walking by Mert's on my way to the Epicenter$LABEL$5
This place is great!  I'm always 95% satisfied with the food here.   Service is very friendly and fast.  And you can't beat the prices!  Daily specials are very good!   I think everyone should give Mert's a try.$LABEL$4
Oh Mert's what a great place for me to checkout on my trip to Charlotte. I wanted some hardcore authentic bbq and Mert's was my destination of choice.I ordered their legendary ribs$LABEL$5
To sum up my recent trip to Mert's...pretty delicious food yet poor customer service. The only fast service was for the drinks and cornbread. Our waiter was very inconsistent and neglecting us. There were at least four tables with more than three customers which received their entrees before my girlfriend and I did. It will be a very long time before I go to Merts again.$LABEL$1
GOOD food! I recommend the salmon cakes$LABEL$4
This is one of those places you can go at lunch time and run into everyone from your local car detailer to power-brokers like the former CEO of NationsBank (now Bank of America).  The food is absolutely delish$LABEL$4
Highly$LABEL$3
Great place for lunch when you're craving soul food in the Queen City.I came here with a coworker for lunch$LABEL$3
We went here while in downtown Charlotte.  It was pretty good soul food.  I had fried chicken$LABEL$4
This pIace earns points for (if nothing else) being open past 8pm on Sunday. I just moved uptown and was in the process of doing some unpacking when hunger struck. As I was unprepared to cook and uptown seems to become a ghost town embarrassingly early on Sunday nights I started walking$LABEL$3
Cool$LABEL$5
I didn't grow up eating southern cooking but I love fried chicken$LABEL$3
Loved the ambience and the staff.  The food was alright.  I grew up on southern cooking so I'm tough to please.  The one thing I will tell you is that their braised cabbage is THE BEST I've ever had.  Get three orders of it and make it your meal.$LABEL$3
You get a lot of food - for a very good price.  Meal starts of with giant steaming mini cornbreads.  Order an entree and get choice of two sides (mac and cheese$LABEL$4
In my opinion EPIC FAIL ...... I'm from Charlotte and my first time going there was last week and boy was i not impressed. I guess when soul food come to my mind i think of greatness because I'm from the south$LABEL$1
My first review was 5 stars$LABEL$3
I rarely give bad reviews$LABEL$1
When we first moved to Charlotte$LABEL$2
Yummy true soul food! I always get the vegetable plate when I go because I can't choose between the many (all amazing) sides. The collared greens are the best I've ever had! Everything is salty$LABEL$4
We came to Mert's after a couple hours of play at the Discovery Place science museum just a few blocks away.The place was pretty much empty at 5:30$LABEL$3
The service here sucks. We went there and they got us the main meal before the appetizer and bread.  When I requested to have my appetizer first$LABEL$1
I'm somewhat embarrassed about this review as I work in Uptown$LABEL$5
O man$LABEL$5
Horrible!!$LABEL$1
For me$LABEL$3
This place was just OK for me.  I was pretty disappointed with the fried chicken because I felt it could have been more flavorful and more fried.  I was surprised because I would have expected more. The catfish my dad and sister ordered was way more fried than the chicken my mom and me had ordered. Also$LABEL$2
Cool restaurant - I went here on a Monday afternoon with the wife$LABEL$4
Mert's Heart & Soul?  Thank you Charlotte for introducing me to this place!  The food is fantastic!  The fried chicken was a lot better the second time I went. I'm not sure what changed.  The collard greens were so good.  Now I'm not a cornbread eater but you really have to try theirs. Also$LABEL$5
I love this place.  This is my favorite restaurant in all of Charlotte.  The food is great$LABEL$5
While visiting Charlotte from Birmingham$LABEL$5
This is a great place to eat! The people there are so nice and the food is fantastic. They have some of the best cornbread I've had and the catfish and chicken are fried to golden perfection but deliciously moist.$LABEL$4
Had the Shrimp Po Boo.  I wish I know that it would be spicy I would have asked them to hold the spice.  Even the Home Fries where spicy.  I understand that it's southern home cooking$LABEL$2
While visiting Charlotte for the DNC$LABEL$4
Go for the cornbread$LABEL$3
UMM$LABEL$5
This place has some good and some bad$LABEL$3
We were in town for the Belk Bowl and went to Mert's for lunch.  It was excellent$LABEL$5
I'm writing this review as a pat on the back for the service at Mert's. The food there is awesome as reflected in other reviews & we've certainly never been disappointed. What's even better than their food though$LABEL$5
Really$LABEL$5
Food is good$LABEL$4
Definitely a must go to! I had the locals recommend this place to me. It was so good i ate two dinners her the same night. I had Sharon serve me and she really knew her stuff. She first suggested  the salmon cakes which were amazing with the side sauce. This is a MUST get if your trying something out there for the first time.Add a sweet tea to it as well! Cannot go wrong with that!Then she suggested the sweet potato pie$LABEL$5
My husband & I went here based on the reviews from here. We were in Charlotte for our anniversary and I was eager to try the local cuisine. I like trying small businesses and supporting them. With that said...Mert's was disappointing and overpriced. The fried chicken was bland$LABEL$1
Based on the previous reviews i was super excited to eat here. However i was a bit disapointed. Fried chicken was kind of bland but nice and juicy and the fried catfish was kind of soggy. Mac and cheese and greens were very good. Service was slow.$LABEL$3
Sunday morning the cornbread hits the spot.  The rest of the meal$LABEL$2
Melt in your mouth cornbread. Soul rolls that make you want to testify. Down home friendly service. Shrimp and Grits that make you smile. Great food close to downtown.$LABEL$4
I really wanted to get grub at Price's$LABEL$2
This restaurant is my favorite restaurant in Uptown. I first visited this restaurant before I moved to Charlotte. I was walking Uptown one day and decided to give them a try. Once I saw that they served soul food$LABEL$5
I really wanted to like this place.  It had cool old wood signs and their original menu on a chalkboard$LABEL$2
Mert's is awesome! I went there for the first time in a while$LABEL$5
I REEEEAAALLY wanted to like Mert's...Any place that has Heart and Soul in the name has to be delicious in my opinion. First$LABEL$3
The cornbread was the best part of the meal$LABEL$2
I'm definitely a fan. The service was awesome$LABEL$4
Can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet.  I used to live uptown and would come here for lunch often.  I'm not a cornbread fan but I do love their cornbread. I also finally had their chicken tenders over the weekend and they were excellent.  I debated between the salmon cakes or the chicken tenders and decided to try something different and I'm glad I did.I had the mac and cheese and collard greens as my accompaniments and I was pretty full$LABEL$5
Not only was the food wonderful but the staff are friendly.  The ribs are sooooo tender and the red beans & rice are fabulous.  The cornbread is YummmmmY.$LABEL$5
I love this place.  There was a time when I ate here twice a week.  The food is amazing and very true to its Gullah/Carolina roots of down-home$LABEL$5
Ok$LABEL$4
Excellent! Home cooking$LABEL$5
Went there with my parents (who are incredible health freaks) but wanted to try southern food$LABEL$5
Where to begin...Even the bread and butter served to each table is utterly delicious! Located conveniently in the downtown$LABEL$5
I had such high hopes for this place but it fell short in many ways. I had their fried green tomatoes and for $6$LABEL$1
It's been several years since I've been to Mert's$LABEL$3
The cornbread is great$LABEL$3
I finally made it to Mert's for dinner. I got the beef ribs. They were pretty good. The Mac and Cheese was delicious and a little burned on the bottom$LABEL$5
Service was great! Servers had awesome personalities and were very hospitable. However$LABEL$2
Best soul food in Charlotte. Other than the clogged arteries$LABEL$5
Mert's was an interesting introduction to soul food.  We ordered sweet tea$LABEL$4
Let me first say how delicious the cornbread was!The catfish that I  ordered was a fillet with a lot of batter on it although it was seasoned nice it was just to much breading for me ( and i thought i was going to get the whole fish not the fillet). The yams were out of a can so that was a major let down. The mac and cheese was not to my liking at all it tasted like it was made with velvetta and other cheap cheeses.The fried chicken was lightly fried and not crispy either but the collard greens were well seasoned.Seems like a tourist spot to me. The staff was friendly and I liked the crowd I didn't get a chance to try the homemade cakes although they looked pretty tasty.I can at least say that I tried this place :)$LABEL$2
Great service and even better soul food. Try the fried green tomatoes$LABEL$4
The food was great. I had the catfish & chicken qtr. combo with greens & yams. You could tell the sides were made ahead of time (they were barely room temperature) but were still pretty tasty. I'd recommend checking this place out if you find yourself in Charlotte!$LABEL$4
I love Mert's- I have been going there for years$LABEL$3
Eight of us went to Mert's today for lunch.  We started out our meal with fried green tomatoes and soul rolls.  The soul rolls were delicious.  I had the beef ribs with Mac and cheese and okra and tomatoes.  The ribs were good$LABEL$4
YUMM CORNBREAD. This place probably has the best cornbread I've ever had in my life. Period.I was in town for a day$LABEL$5
This restaurant seemed perfect online but when I went there  it was totally different experience. As soon as stepped a foot in the restaurant I was in the face with bad smell which was combination of old frid fosh and burnt oil. This smell will stick to you for four to five  hours at least.The corn bread was the only good thing in the restaurant. I ordered chicken wings which was cold and \""rubbery\"".My friend ordered po-boy chicken  tenders tge bread was old and hard consequendly  he couldn't eat his sandwich.$LABEL$2
I am a new resident to the City of Charlotte. In search of some where to have dinner in the uptown area$LABEL$1
People in charlotte rave about mert's$LABEL$3
The cornbread was good but everything was without season and it was fruit Flys (along with the traps) everywhere! The collard greens had an excessive amount of uncooked onions and tomatoes. I would not recommend this to anyone if you are in the mood for good food.$LABEL$2
I don't know what all the fuss is about.  The cornbread is good$LABEL$2
I went here with my family on a Friday night.  There were six adults and two kids.  We went early$LABEL$3
Mert's is true southern soul food.  Not the New American type$LABEL$4
Mert's is very good soul food. Came here with a friend last week. It took a minute for the cornbread to come out because it was hot and fresh out the kitchen. I'm not a big cornbread fan$LABEL$4
Soul food that make your heart smile. Every time i visit da south for work I get excited about new bbq and soul food spots that I get to try. This place alone made my trip worth while. Had the jumbo wings with mac and cheese$LABEL$5
I had the blackened salmon$LABEL$3
Chopped pork$LABEL$4
Very inconsistent.$LABEL$2
What a disappointment!  My first day in Charlotte and I had checked Yelp reviews to plan my meals.  The only good thing I can say is service was friendly and the cornbread was good.  However$LABEL$1
Although I have been using yelp for many years$LABEL$1
I spoke with Veronica the general manager. She apologized profusely for the mix up and assured me that she spoke with the staff. Ultimately$LABEL$1
If this is great Southern Food then I am a craw dad .  The Okra was not fresh and rather tasteless$LABEL$2
Our table agreed that the best part of this meal was the corn bread. Every order was lacking just that little something that would make a meal enjoyable. One person in our party of seven has said that he will return to give them another try.  The rest of us will not be back$LABEL$2
I love that this place is open and serving dinner until 11 or midnight.  That's hard to find in Uptown unless you are at the epicenter.The food - well$LABEL$3
The worst customer service by server and manager. We've been coming here for years. Tonight's experience is one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. Supposedly there was a computer error with our food. Fine$LABEL$1
WAIST OF TIME!!! My husband and I were in town for our 3 year anniversary and came to Merts after a great recommendation. We went to yelp and read the over all great reviews and were excited about trying this place. We waited about 20 min which was a good sign. The hostess wasn't too friendly but she was super busy so I could understand. Our waitress was an older lady who took our drink orders almost right away. Here is where it went down hill....she took her sweet time coming back to take our order( I know she saw me looking at her like WTH?) once our order was taken those were the very last words she spoke to us. We waited an HOUR with not so much as an I'm sorry this is taking too long or can I get you anything else? Finally my husband overheard a cook in the back yell that our order had not even been processed yet and was 4th in line!!! We threw a 5 on the table for that nasty too sweet diabetes lemonade they gave me and left! WILL NOT RETURN. OH....I'm not sure what corn bread everybody else on this reviews was eating but ours was WACK! Barley warm and not sweet at all. This place has EXTREMELY POOR customer service. We left and went to Emeralds restaurant where the service was SECOND TO NONE!$LABEL$1
Let me start off by saying that my experience was horrible and I would not recommend this place to anyone.  My wife and I came to Charlotte celebrating our anniversary and decided to try Mert's per recommendation of her supervisor and because of the high praise the restaurant received online.  We were seated in a reasonable time but it was all down hill from there. We were seated at 7:15pm and were given some bland cornbread.  At 8:15pm we were still waiting for our order to be prepared (cooked)...not brought to us...PREPARED! Now mind you no one even a word of apology or an update on the status of our food during the wait. Finally I had enough and walked out. Our waitress and management still did not offer an apology despite seeing us leave the restaurant visibly upset. We left and walked to E2 (emeralds restaurant) and received the best meal and customer service I've ever experienced. I'd recommend all the other restaurants in downtown Charlotte before Mert's. :-/$LABEL$1
We had to come try this place out since it had amazing reviews. We were disappointed TWICE!..The service was great both times.  We had carryout the first time and ate in the second.  The place was busy both times and the Chicken wings were the only thing that was consistently good.  The Collard Greens are the toughest and tasteless greens I've ever had and the Mac & Cheese is so so.  My Husband had the fried whiting and it was tasty but he also didn't like the sides and said the greens were gritty. We both agree that the cornbread is delicious.  I would return for the Chicken Wings only.$LABEL$2
HORRIBLE customer service! (Not the waitress). The food was warm$LABEL$1
If you want a tasty soulful brunch on a Saturday morning$LABEL$5
This place is amazing! The cornbread is perfectly buttery and moist$LABEL$4
Such amazing soul food! Seriously some of the best collard greens ever! It's a shame that such awesome food can be disappointed by such horrible service! We waited for over an hour for an omelette and a vegetable plate! The waitress could have cared less that we had to wait. Our drinks stayed empty for most of the meal and it took 20 minutes and repeated requests for a small packet of mustard! We are from out of town and had heard such amazing things about this place! Once again$LABEL$2
Horrible service!!! Server forgot to put our order in. Came back 30 minutes later with lame lie. Another 20 minutes later still no food$LABEL$1
Waited 45 minutes to get in at 8pm on Friday$LABEL$2
Me and my family were in Charlotte for my Sorority's conference and we decided to go to Mert's for our last night in Charlotte. The wait wasn't bad and they accommodated for a party of 9 which was also nice because most small restaurants would just seat you at different tables. We did not think the food lived up to the hype...at all. Lemonade...not freshly squeezed$LABEL$2
It was great. Our waitress was definitely a good host. I highly recommend this place if your in Charlotte. Mac and cheese was on point. I didn't care for the collard greens but overall we all enjoyed our meal and service.$LABEL$4
Service was extremely slow. We sat at our table for quite a while before we were waited on. Once we ordered the server brought cornbread right away. It's good but$LABEL$2
The worst restaurant ever! It doesn't matter if the food tastes good or not.. The service is the worst! Lazy and slow as ever!$LABEL$1
I love soul food restaurants and this one is definitely a fave. I haven't tried anything there that I have not loved. I hate cornbread in general$LABEL$4
I finally got myself to Mert's for dinner the other night after reading all the great reviews. Unfortunately$LABEL$3
I was in Charlotte for the first time and decided to treat myself to a good southern dinner. My waitress Teresa greeted me with Southern Hospitality and just when thought that I had my meal selected (after reading Yelp$LABEL$4
Walking Uptown on a Sunday morning before church$LABEL$2
I've been here twice now (The first time my living social wouldn't load so we had to return$LABEL$3
We chose to visit Mert's over going to a high-end chain because we wanted southern style cuisine$LABEL$2
We've been on a search to find great southern soul food in Charlotte and this place is definitely at the top of the list so far. The location uptown on College next to the theatre was perfect. The service was excellent. The Perch was perfectly prepared. The baked macaroni and cheese was by far the best I have ever tasted. The Collard Greens$LABEL$5
Breakfast food is excellent$LABEL$5
After participating in the Charlotte heart walk$LABEL$1
Mert's is a great find in downtown Charlotte.  The service is solid and the food is pretty good.  They have a beer and wine menu$LABEL$4
This was my second and most likely last time attending this restaurant.  Reason for this statement is our waitress topped off my glass of water with water from a glass not a pitcher. Who fills a patrons glass like that?$LABEL$1
Soul food is ok...needs more seaoning and to be drained of grease. My entire rating is based off the customer service which was very rude and disrespectful for me as a customer. The wait was long and don't try to make reservations because they dont take on weekends.  The waitresses have bad attitudes and rush you when ordering. ...\""imma take yall drink order and food order at the same time so who first?\"" (Her exact words). I live in charlotte and have been here prior to this visit but will never return again. This was by far the worst soul food experience.$LABEL$2
I have had the pleasure of dining at Merts frequently over the past 15+ years. I've always been pleased with the food and service. Today....I had lunch here and ordered the Merts world famous Salmon Cakes. Sadly it appears the Salmon cakes are now Salmon BALLS. The portions appears to be cut in half. To whom it may concern.....we LOVE and adore this dish$LABEL$3
Great place to get soul food in the city. You will have to wait for a table on weekends. The wait staff is personable$LABEL$3
Gritty greens$LABEL$2
1. CORNBREAD!2. Amazing southern food$LABEL$5
While visiting Charlotte$LABEL$5
Great place...excellent fried catfish.$LABEL$4
Took my boyfriend for first time.  Waitress kept going outside smoking and smelled like ashtray upon returning to table.  Cornbread good.  Chicken good.  BBQ was disgusting and swimming in grease.  Potato salad was also old tasting and could not eat.  I was embarrassed that I had bragged to my bf about how good things were and then had such a terrible experience.   And it was over $30 for lunch.  Not worth the drive$LABEL$1
Slow service con this cold and wet Monday. The servers just didn't have it together and neither did the cooks as my chicken was seasonless and my Mac and cheese was cold. The only thing you can expect from Mert's is inconsistency.$LABEL$2
Great food$LABEL$5
I'm from NY. I only know what Southern cuisine entails from the Food Network Channel. Other than that$LABEL$3
I'm particular about my soul food. Seeing how I can cook it myself$LABEL$4
Great place. I had a birthday dinner last week. The food and service was great. Friendly staff .. Very pleased.$LABEL$4
Brevard Court is good for an inexpensive lunch.  Nothing fancy$LABEL$3
On business in Charlotte$LABEL$3
Good$LABEL$5
Yuck!  I was on my way to Johnny Burritos when I saw their sign of \""specials\"".  I stopped in and ordered the cream of potato soup and a grilled cheese sandwich.  Both were awful.  The soup had the consistency of milk$LABEL$1
They got some solid subs here$LABEL$4
Never even knew there was a Jersey Mike's uptown till recently.  I may just have to start putting this into my rotation.  I came in on a Tuesday for the Super Tuesday deal ($6.50 for Sub/Chips/Drink).  It was pretty packed and I was told normally it's more crowded.  Note to self$LABEL$4
Jersey Mike's Tuesday Special is awesome. $7 for any regular sub$LABEL$5
I go here with coworkers very frequently$LABEL$4
Oh$LABEL$4
This place was cool because it uses locally grown food in all it's dishes$LABEL$4
Absolutely fantastic. My husband and I were staying in downtown Charlotte last month and went to Mimosa Grill on a Friday night for dinner. We were looking to have a delicious$LABEL$5
Pros:Great ambianceService was friendly and attentiveCons:Kettle one with soda - everyone knows that's soda water right??? not 7-up$LABEL$2
Ate lunch here today... pulled pork was excellent$LABEL$3
Low country cooking at its best in the City!  Well$LABEL$4
Came in here for lunch$LABEL$3
Best thing about eating lunch here is the patio seating. Special soft shell crab over mixed green salad was disapponting at best. Soft shell crab was over-battered and lacked crab flavor. Salad was dull and lime vingrette seemed to be missing the lime. Chopped red onion totally overpowered. On prior visits$LABEL$1
I've been to this restaurant for several other business dinners but this visit was the most unsatisfactory visit.Fresh off a 5 hour flight$LABEL$2
Went on a Saturday night.  Had reservations and was given the option of outside seating or indoor.  Very accommodating.  Recommends the cheese plate.  Great service and atmosphere.$LABEL$4
My team was in Charlotte for a cross country meet this past weekend and our team manager made reservations for us at Mimosa Grill.  There was probably a group on 15 of us and we were seated immediately.  They really worked with us picky runners to make sure we had everything we needed the night before our big race.  They kept our glasses filled with water and sent over a few baskets of biscuits while we waited for each course. Everything was pretty good and the atmosphere was very nice... and best of all the race went pretty well for the team the next day!$LABEL$3
Well$LABEL$2
I was in town for two days and our hotel recommended this place$LABEL$4
Truffle Fries!!  Wow!  I am only writing a review on the total ambiance and bar menu.  I didnt actually get a chance to sit down and have dinner but that will inevitably happen soon.  The location and atmosphere is simply wonderful.  We sat inside at the bar on a Friday during happy hour and things started jumping.  Not jumping like packed and annoying$LABEL$4
Took clients to dinner on a week night on what appeared to be a slow time. We were placed into a very crowded part of the restaurant. (empty tables elsewhere) Waiter was fair at best and he seemed in a hurry through out the meal. Food was nothing more than average which was a surprise after the high rating I read about. Unfortunately$LABEL$2
I enjoyed a 3 course brunch at Mimosa. We had a good discussion with our waiter about the area and the meal. Nice ambiance and food was top notch. I look forward to trying lunch/dinner in the future.$LABEL$4
The food was good$LABEL$4
Read reviews and beg to differ. Had to argue with staff that a martini does not only have two ounces! The glass was literally less than half full. For 11 dollars a glass! Rob was the bartender.When we complained twice$LABEL$2
Excellent service!! Brooke and Hannah are awesome servers!! Food was excellent$LABEL$5
Rating Mimosa Grill is an interesting balance for me.  The balance is between lunch and dinner.  This review will be for all my lunch experiences which have generally been pretty good so$LABEL$4
I brought some out of town guests here hoping to impress them with an uptown dinner.  We left hungry and disappointed.  The food tasted ok$LABEL$2
During restaurant week$LABEL$3
Good food and flavor.  Cold greeting at hostess desk.  Service good.  I would go back.$LABEL$3
Say hello to amazing food and say goodbye to a little weight out of your wallet. The food here is simply amazing. I always start with the Mimosa tea - lemonade and tea mix.Where to start? The appetizers are great$LABEL$4
Had shrimp and grits for lunch.  Was not expecting much having lived on the Gulf Coast but was pleasantly surprised.$LABEL$4
Had the Rock House Wagyu Burger at Mimosa Grill w/ fries lightly seasoned with herbs$LABEL$3
i'm from california and did extensive research on food in the downtown area$LABEL$2
Awesome $20 (including drink) Sunday brunch that not only includes the normal stuff (eggs$LABEL$4
It's a local treasure that may be overlooked in the city of Charlotte. However$LABEL$4
I went here for a business lunch the other day$LABEL$2
The food was so great!  The pecan crusted trout was um um good.  The potatoes were as they say on the food network; plated too early; not hot.  They didn't spoil the dish but maybe I was hungry.  The shrimp fish and grits were indeed a treat!  We will go back again.  Waitress was friendly!  We ordered the mimosa cocktail and it was okay.  Since the food was tasty it's on the must return list.$LABEL$4
So I had a friend visiting from Denver$LABEL$4
Came here with a small group for a business dinner.  The staff were VERY friendly$LABEL$5
Sounded better than it was. the Waygu burger is all hype and not that flavorful. Waitress was friendly and wanted to make sure I left full$LABEL$2
I've been to Mimosa probably 10 times in the past 2 years or so.  It's our go-to fancy lunch for new people at work.  Always great.  I've liked everything I've ever had there from the pecan crusted chicken to the asian salad.  Can't speak to the drinks (probably wouldn't be a good idea to slam cocktails at a work lunch)$LABEL$4
I'd heard quite a bit about this place from my coworkers (who say to get the burger) but I had the pecan crusted mountain trout on creamed potatoes. The breading while quite good didn't really have any pecan flavor which I've seen done expertly in New Orleans. That being said it was still delicious but that's where they lost a star. The creamed potatoes were a great contrast to the crisp$LABEL$4
We had a disappointing experience with customer service regarding a group reservation. In fact$LABEL$1
Dinner food is high quality/fresh and the recipes are interesting.Fresh pear butter and biscuits were a nice bonus.$LABEL$4
Fish and chips were great.  People should not come here for lunch and discuss business.  Enjoy your meal as if it were your last.$LABEL$5
Love this place!   Southern cuisine with a modern twist!  Great food$LABEL$5
Should get 3.5 stars. Was here for DNC-sponsored event. Open bar. Their offering was a bit underwhelming from their entire restaurant group. Bar service was still acceptable. I got empanadas$LABEL$3
I booked this restaurant for a business dinner while at a trade show$LABEL$4
Making a reservation was easy. Arriving early and asking to be seated - not so much. I'm not sure if it was the hostess policy or just the hostess herself$LABEL$3
Getting seated wasn't difficult but after that the experience fell apart. We ordered  cocktails and water. The cocktails came in a timely manner but we only received one water. My husband ordered the shrimp and grits and I ordered the grilled scallops with butternut squash. The temperature of both dishes was cool. Almost room temperature. My husbands shrimp and grits were colder than my squash. The service was not professional. Being rushed to get the credit card out after receiving the bill.$LABEL$1
If I could give Mimosa Grill \""0\"" stars$LABEL$1
I looked at the reviews and thought this would be a great place for bunch.  Wrong! I don't know how their regular menu food is but their brunch was horrible with a capital H.  $21 a person was way too much for disgusting food.$LABEL$1
Okay so I was just going about my day and it dawned on me - MAN$LABEL$5
Very overrated$LABEL$2
Get to the Chase:Pros:1) Great for brunch buffet! All you can eat flat rate $30 2) Polite service$LABEL$3
Took my parents here for brunch on a Sunday. First of all$LABEL$2
Absolutely fabulous. Our waiter$LABEL$5
We went here during Restaurant Week and really liked it.  Everything was very fresh - farm to table concept and they support local farmers.  The heirloom tomato salad was excellent.  They were able to accomodate our food preferences and ensured my entire meal was gluten free.  I will definitely try this place again.$LABEL$4
I heard from a couple of people that the fish and chips Friday special was something I needed to try and they were not wrong. Thankfully we were able to order our special around 12:50pm because by 1pm$LABEL$4
Service was good except they forgot to give us the basket of biscuits which we received promptly after we asked for it. The fried oysters were a disappointment. the breading fell off and they seemed under cooked. The lamb was cooked and seasoned perfectly. The dumplings that came with it were mediocre as was the cheesy creamed spinach. The short rib was tasty served on a bed of potato hash also good. The peach cobbler was not made with fresh peaches and should be skipped.$LABEL$3
I loved the interior and its very relaxing after a long day. The menu has a lot of variety$LABEL$4
Great food and great service! We went for dinner with 3 teenage girls. They had seen Parmesan truffle fries on an online menu. Typically that's only a lunch item. The chef gladly made it for them at dinner when they asked$LABEL$4
Only a half step above a chain restaurant.My friend and I had been dying to get into the place but we really were excited and anxious about nothing... The meal started with the lobster mac&chz and stuffed hush puppies as appetizers. The good news were that the apps were presented well and very tasty.  The bad news is that they were the best part of the meal. The m&c had good texture and balance but was highly seasoned and both my dining partner and I felt that it was too salty. The hush puppies were spot on. Loaded with shrimp & crawfish in a delicate white sauce with toasted onion slivers. Yummy! The crispy texture of the hush puppies$LABEL$2
The dinner was incredible- beet salad and scallop dinner with Brussels sprouts (ahh$LABEL$4
First of all$LABEL$2
Went here for dinner last weekend Saturday. The food was great the service was great. Would love to go there Again and try everything on the menu.$LABEL$5
An awesome dinner on Valentines.  The trout entr\u00e9e was possibly the best combination of flavors$LABEL$5
Overrated.  Food just OK.  I had the grilled salad to start.  Nice smoky flavor$LABEL$3
fantastic! great service$LABEL$5
This place was just ok. I had the lobster mac and cheese but some of the shells were a bit over cooked. The cheese sauce wasn't anything spectacular just felt like a regular mac and cheese sauce. I feel this could be such a great dish but it was just okay. My husband had the slow roasted bbq pork flatbread - it was good but a little too sweet and a little too much cheese. I KNOW... TOO MUCH CHEESE? NEVER! But seriously when it comes to pork and cheese together there is a limit. DON'T JUDGE ME!The best part was that if you are staying at the near by Marriott then you get a discount.$LABEL$3
I went here for Sunday brunch trusting all the good yelp reviews.  However$LABEL$1
Friendly$LABEL$3
Definite points for service--we were a large group of over 20 people for dinner. The food was quite good$LABEL$3
Checked this place out on a weekday for lunch. Was pretty busy but we were seated right away. Great selection of dishes on the menu. Was hard to decide what to order. Decided on turkey sandwich.. Very good$LABEL$4
Went expecting spectacular. Had been for lunch and had a great experience. Went for queens feast tonight. Got lobster Mac and that was good$LABEL$2
I wasn't quite as impressed with this place as everyone else seems to be. I ordered a chocolate martini which looked and tasted like a first time bartender made$LABEL$2
Service was fast and courteous. Shrimp and grits was great... However$LABEL$3
The first time I have ever asked my server to get me the recipe for a dish! The Carolina coastal catch is hands down one of the best dishes I've ever had. Great place to celebrate our anniversary!$LABEL$5
A beautiful location in uptown Charlotte. Get the Sunday brunch. Awesome! $3 mimosas on Sunday$LABEL$4
Hushpuppies were a creative take and phenomenal. After we received out app$LABEL$3
High end feel at this uptown farm to table restaurant. Definitely works for an intimate evening out or a large group. I love that you're encouraged to customize your meal! We had the filet$LABEL$4
I only stopped in to get a night cap (dessert)$LABEL$4
Just ok food and service is not the greatest.  It took a long time to seat us for lunch$LABEL$2
Great experience.  The menu has a great selection$LABEL$4
Arthurs offers a decent variety of genres all in one stop.  Grilled items like cheesesteaks; burgers; patty melts$LABEL$3
As a frequent stop on our work \""lunch train\"" (choo$LABEL$4
Down on the plaza level of the \""jukebox building\"" in uptown$LABEL$3
I enjoy this club$LABEL$4
So my experience with this place was as a perspective employee (not as a dancer$LABEL$3
Very classy and clean inside. They serve good food.  The strippers are alright looking. I got one lap dance$LABEL$3
Anyone who knows me knows that I'm not one for strip clubs. However$LABEL$4
Every strip club has its perks and aspects it needs to work on$LABEL$3
Listen$LABEL$3
I have never been to a strip club before$LABEL$4
I have gone to this club in the past and have enjoyed the experience.   I recently decided to revisit this club and had a bad experience .  I saw a dancer that caught my eye. I offered her a drink and a dance. After her canoodling me  I gave in and said i'll take  one ( 30 dollar)  dance.After some pleasant conversation over the drink( I treated her to)$LABEL$1
First and last to this club. Very pricy$LABEL$1
Worst strip club I've ever been to. Do NOT even think you could use coupons or think the manager will honor anything. Received a complementary free pass and was denied by the manager even though there was no restrictions. Worst service ever$LABEL$1
This is the most expensive club in Charlotte$LABEL$2
Why yes$LABEL$3
Even though the address says Trade St$LABEL$3
Ordered from Fuel takeout the other night when we were completely starving and craving some good greasy cheesy pizza. The delivery came on time - as you know$LABEL$3
I am torn on this late night pizza joint. Great pizza$LABEL$2
I'm not a huge pizza fan$LABEL$2
I wasn't assked but...let me tell you...I did not anticipate pizza south of the Mason-Dixon line to taste anything like a northern east coast walk through the city.  I was pleasantly shocked to find myself licking sauce off the lips of another patron in the Fuel Stop that afternoon I went.    It was really that good.  It was \""lick the lips of another patron good\"".  Can pizza taste any better down here?Still...don't give up on a few of the other NYC pie makers quite yet.  But I will continue to make this one of my stops everytime I am in the Queen City.$LABEL$4
We came here last night for a quick bite before hitting the town a little$LABEL$3
Fuel Pizza is good but definitely not the best in Charlotte. I like to come here when I am looking for a quick lunch fix  ( under $6 for a big slice and a salad$LABEL$3
Let me paint the scene for you: It's about 2:30 am on a Saturday night/Sunday morning. My friends and I have been at the Lady Gaga show for the past 4 hours$LABEL$3
Forgot to yelp Fuel!So$LABEL$3
Our group stopped in for some much needed drunken munchies after a night out.  The fact that we could get decent pizza at such a late hour is worthy of 4 stars to me.  The service was quick and they had a good variety of pizza slices to choose from.  I thoroughly enjoyed my pepperoni slice and garlic knots.  The pizza crust is thin and New York style$LABEL$4
Fuel Pizza is a hot spot for spilling out of uptown clubs and bars and when in need of some good greasy pizza.  It's normally pretty crowded and in my opinion$LABEL$3
I love Fuel as a post-1am drunken pizza spot.  It would get 5-stars for being such a reliable late night option.  It's in a great location$LABEL$3
Awful!!!! If i could give it no stars I would!!!! Awful!!!! Way way way over priced for bad/ok pizza... over $12.00 for 3 slices who do they think they are...? There food is Ok at best! I live and work uptown I will never go back and will warn friends to stay away!!!! AWFUL!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$1
I guess their pizza taste great if you're drunk. Slices are so bland and bad. Nothing special here. Overpriced as well. Villa Francesca has much better slices. Check them out instead.$LABEL$2
After the bars and clubs close uptown$LABEL$3
Unfortunately this could be one of the most disappointing lunch experiences I have had in Uptown.  Being Catholic$LABEL$1
Aaaaaa-hole employees give the worst service you'll ever have. Unless you're blackout go elsewhere. They wouldn't give me a water for a dollar. $1.08. Ate the pizza dry as shit. Never again. Pizza was good though.$LABEL$1
Second delivery second problem.  My girlfriend ordered wings and I took the order.....no wings.  When we called$LABEL$1
Ordered at ORDER HERE sign. She sends me to the cashier. Cashier asks me to repeat my order to him. I give him an \""are you serious\"" look. What a bunch of idiots.$LABEL$1
If you gotta lotta lotta hard work to do at the government center$LABEL$3
Great place to grab a quick bite before a meeting in the halls of the Government Center. The cajun chicken sandwich is out of this world and the make your own Arnold Palmer is always a great addition. Make sure to check it out!$LABEL$4
Yay for a lovely Italian spot that is a little upscale. While I am all for casual dining$LABEL$4
We went there for restaurant week. The place is very cozy. Drinks are at least $8 a pop. The hostess was really accommodating and friendly. Unfortunately the food was far from impressive. They brought bread and bean which is yummy but there were not enough for eight of us. I'm not sure why you would bring 5 slices of bread on a table of 8 (we must look like those Atkins diet people). The crab/salmon patty was overcook. The risotto was good. The dinner (some kind of fish) was salty. To make matter worse... I found a long blond hair in my fish. The waiter comp my meal out. The manager never come out and talk to us (I think he's too busy tasting the wines). In conclusion... yea... we're not coming back.$LABEL$1
The best Italian Experience I have ever had in the Charlotte area. I am Italian$LABEL$5
I ate here with co-workers while on a business trip. It's very dim inside. If I were living in Charlotte$LABEL$3
We love it and the veal sage ravioli is amazing. The Osso Buco to die for. This is not a place you go everyday but they own a lot of other places here in Charlotte. So you can get the same qaulity and a little less pricey. Osteria Coco in front is the and I believe meaa luna too.Really good Northern Italian Food$LABEL$5
This review is for their lunch sitting...Wow....that one word sums up this place for lunch.  If you would have told me that I would be able to have a sitdown two-course lunch for $12.95 in Uptown$LABEL$5
Since I have promised myself that I'm not allowed to move away from Charlotte until I have eaten at every restaurant$LABEL$4
We went there with a large group from work for restaurant week. They didn't seat us right away$LABEL$4
My wife and I had a very nice dinner at Luce on a Wednesday night to celebrate our anniversary.   The food was excellent and the service was superb.  I ordered the Carbonara as an entree and she had a ravioli dish$LABEL$5
I picked this restaurant for my birthday based on reviews and reputation.  I was not let down!  The ambiance was great (romantic but not stuffy) and the staff went above and beyond to make sure that our experience was special.  The food was great and very reasonably priced for the portion sizes.  The wine list was pricey$LABEL$4
Wow. This place was outstanding. Alluring$LABEL$4
The atmosphere was nice$LABEL$3
Great place. Excellent experience. Had the scallops for my main dish. Amazing!  If I could give this place 10 stars$LABEL$5
My fianc\u00e9e and I visited Luce on our last evening in Charlotte$LABEL$5
Let me start by saying the food was excellent.  If you are looking for some great food$LABEL$3
The food is pretty good.  The beans and bread they serve is pretty tasty.  I had the gnocchi which was pretty delicious$LABEL$4
One of the first places I ate in Charlotte and it was certainly memorable. The white table cloths$LABEL$5
Just Ok!  Not sure if all the glowing reviews set my expectations too high$LABEL$3
Went to Luce for a business dinner / Christmas celebration.  I'm Italian and am very picky about the places I eat Italian food outside of my own house and can honestly say that this place is the real deal.We made reservations because we had a larger party and I hate waiting.  Our table was waiting for us upon arrival and we were ushered to our seats in no time.  Manuel welcomed us warmly and proceeded to attend to us throughout the evening with ease.  Our service was impeccable.I ordered the Mare.  Lobster$LABEL$4
We had a wonderful$LABEL$5
My husband and I ate here before seeing 'Book of Mormon'.  Everything was great - food$LABEL$5
I eat there last week on a recommendation from a fellow employee.   I was by myself so I decided to eat at the bar.   The ambiance is very nice$LABEL$2
I loved the ambiance. Well decorated and fancy white table cloth. I ordered the veal$LABEL$2
I can't think of anything due to my food coma but it was all five stars!  The blackberry sorbet was a perfect finish.$LABEL$5
This restaurant really does deserve the awards that adorn their walls!! My partner & I had a truly \""spiritual\"" food experience here. The menu is full of mouth-watering authentic Italian dishes....that please the palate & leaves you wanting MORE.We will visit Charlotte NC again & again just to eat at this restaurant...$LABEL$5
Luce it turns out$LABEL$4
The best thing about this restaurant is the atmosphere. My husband and I went here during restaurant week & left feeling disappointed. Our waiter was not very attentive. The bread they bring out is good but the bean topping to go with it was overpowered with onions. We both got the seafood salad as an appetizer and it was just ok. Nothing spectacular. We both also had the lamb as an entree. It was cooked perfectly to medium & was very tender but it lacked seasoning. It would have been wonderful with some seasoning. For dessert I had the panna cotta. It was not impressive. The presentation was nice but it had no flavor. My husband had the chocolate cake which tasted like a frozen cake you get from the supermarket. The manager insisted it is made fresh in house but I'm not sure if I believe that. Overall we were very disappointed$LABEL$2
Sauce by Chef Boyardee. And that is NOT a compliment. The evening started okay. We did not have reservations$LABEL$2
Fun place to go drink a few beers$LABEL$2
As a dive bar this might work... as a restaurant it is a total loss. The food is far below pub grub standards and their audacity to claim \""The Best Burger in Charlotte\"" is simply ridiculous. The service and food quality are non-existent. This place only exists because of its prime downtown location.$LABEL$2
came in here and sat at the bar only because they had open spots during panthers playoff weekend.   Never thought i would be doing panther shots in a deli.  But it served its purpose.  We didnt eat but bartenders were nice enough.  Drinks are a little pricey for plastic cups.$LABEL$3
This was stop #4 on our night uptown/downtown.  I paid $8 for small plastic cups of John Daly which is ridiculous.  However$LABEL$2
Nice hotel$LABEL$5
how do they give you a warm cookie when you check in? i'm not sure but they do!everything went well with my stay at the double tree hotel$LABEL$3
Lots of adjectives come to mind. Dumpy. Ancient. Moldy. Quite far from the heart of downtown (by Charlotte standards). Most rooms don't even have a minibar. Nor do they have nice TVs.The wifi speed was decent though. That's always a plus.$LABEL$2
The location was fine and the room had recently been updated to be very(almost excessively) modern. However$LABEL$2
Stayed here on business for 2 nights. Likes:My room was recently updated: fresh decor$LABEL$3
Okay$LABEL$2
In town for the Belk Bowl Game. The room was average size and had a sort Chaise chair for relaxing. The bed was very comfortable. One highlight was the excellent staff. Room service was fast and the food very tasty. When we had a problem with the in room safe$LABEL$5
I attended a convention in Charlotte at the end of July 2013 and the hotels that were partnered with the conference were all booked. I chose this hotel as part of a package on Travelocity.Located uptown right near the Johnson and Wales campus$LABEL$3
BEWARE! Housekeepers are THIEFS!I stayed at Double Tree in Charlotte$LABEL$1
Great first impression.  Lobby looks very clean and nice$LABEL$5
2 stars for the curtious staff.  Rooms do not have fridges or microwaves....they can be provided at a charge if $10 (each) per day.  Decent fitness facility$LABEL$2
Pros:                            Cons:Awesome staff.            14$ breakfastClean rooms.                No fridge                                      No microwave                                      No coffee$LABEL$2
Everything you would expect from a Hilton Doubletree - clean$LABEL$3
One star. It's only because they won't let me give it zero stars. Read this carefully$LABEL$1
I stayed here over the weekend (September 26-28) and was honestly not pleased. I booked with my HHonors and checked in with their app. The app lets you add things to your room before you arrive (refreshments$LABEL$2
Decent rooms. Great location downtown. I wanted to work from my room but there was no hard wire connection and the wifi was weak along with a weak password given to everyone. The breakfast buffet was ok$LABEL$3
This bar is not too far from where I work.  I was told by a friend that it was a gay bar$LABEL$4
I never thought about the name \"" Irish Pub\"" but the menu is pretty much American. I never knew they had \""Tommy Tots\"" in Ireland maybe that was the cause of the potato famine. Seriously$LABEL$3
This place is great!  I have been coming for quite a while$LABEL$4
It is somewhat interesting seeing a bar named \""Hartigans\"" - obviously an Irish name$LABEL$3
It smells like beer$LABEL$3
The food CAN be pretty good here$LABEL$1
Cozy and welcoming.  This is my impression upon entering Hartigan's.  The menu features typical pub favorites$LABEL$4
The bartender downstairs was extremely rude. I guess if you don't \""look\"" gay$LABEL$1
Funky little vibe place with a nice selection of great sandwiches.  And tater tots!!!Went here for a date night and had a good time.  Friendly service and one of a few places that actually serves good tater tots.  I don't drink so I didn't pay much attention to the bar$LABEL$3
I know I am from out of town$LABEL$2
Tiny little pub$LABEL$3
A few weeks ago$LABEL$1
Small$LABEL$3
I think I might have been the first person to go to Phil's for a bite to eat.  Ever.  Definitely more a bar - though the business name here is \""tavern\$LABEL$2
Don't walk by too fast$LABEL$3
You may end up here on Sat night if all the other area bars are busy.I'm not going to come down too hard on this place because it wasn't my choice to come here. One of the locals led a group of guys here initially just to have 'one shot'. He lives in the Avenue and knows the bar owner and several of the staff.  We got quick and efficient service at a great priceand ended up staying for a few rounds of beers after a round of shots.This place is rough$LABEL$1
What the hell$LABEL$1
Rudest bartender I've ever had$LABEL$2
If you like to drink with 18-21 yr old girls - this might be your place.  If you want to chill with a mature crowd - go elsewhere.  However$LABEL$3
Phil's is a small sports bar just off the beaten path. Had the bacon cheese burger w hand cut chips. Burger was juicy and well seasoned$LABEL$3
I'm from Chicago suburbs$LABEL$5
My friend and I stopped in Phil's for a bite to eat before seeing a play at the Belk theater.  We enjoyed the food and drinks and the DIVE feel.  The owner seemed really nice but the waitresses were hard to flag down.  The second time we were there was on a Friday night and there were about 5 people at the bar so we sat at the table right behind the bar.  Never got served in the 10 minutes we were there so we left and walked in the rain to another bar.  We will probably stop in there again but if the service doesn't get any better then we will find another DIVE.$LABEL$3
Not the place to be. Crowd was dull . Music was ok$LABEL$2
This place is terrible$LABEL$1
The place feels like an old bar. I went there with a group of work folks so I got to see a variety of sandwiches hot and cold.Phil has lots of different sandwiches that you can try$LABEL$3
We ended up here for a quick bite and some drinks before a show at TWC Arena on New Years Eve.  Drinks were strong and cheap and service was fast and friendly even though they were swamped.  I opted for the French Dip$LABEL$3
So we have had an ant in our drink$LABEL$1
Average pizza at best and sub-par appetizers. Decent beer specials are only upside. Walk across the street and eat at Fuel for some real pizza.$LABEL$3
I was really excited to checkout Brixx.  I had heard some great things about it.  We hit the 6th Street location.  My friends arrived before me and had their beers for 20 minutes.  10 minutes after I arrived$LABEL$1
It's slipped. I was a huge Brixx fan back in the day but it's just not up to par now. Bruschetta was stale over-toasted bread with marinated tomatoes. Salad was somewhat wilted greens drenched in dressing. Interior deserves a renovation. I hope they make it$LABEL$2
Brixx= Primetime Happy Hour. Working in the ITC$LABEL$4
Went here with my sisters while I was visiting Charlotte. One sister got a salad that was a good size while my other sister and I got two individual pizzas to share. We had enough with some leftovers- could have really gotten one and shared. I thought I was more hungry then I really was. We sat outside but got put at a table that was more shade then sun and in october it was chilly in the shade. Overall attentive staff and good food.$LABEL$3
For a casual happy hour type place$LABEL$3
Average to mediocre pizza.  I had a beer and the Bronx Bomber and never tasted a pizza this salty before.  And if the oven is wood fired they are doing it a grave injustice with the dough they use for the crust. It was sort of pasty white and bland with absolutely no character to it.  I know it is my personal bias but I prefer a crust that has some big air bubbles and an oven hot enough to char it just a bit All in all I was disappointed by the food.  The two stars are because of the good service.$LABEL$2
Went their for the Four Friends Cask Event.  Had a blast!  Me and a bunch of my friends went.  It was crowded - there was a Bobcats game that night too - tons of people eating great food and drinking great local brew.  Management is friendly and staff in attentive.I ordered the Americo (classic pepperoni and mushroom pizza)  this is my favorite and I ate all but two slices!I recommend this place as an early evening launching spot before hitting the other places downtown.$LABEL$4
Really. Good. Pizza.  Great variety of beer and wine.  If you are in downtown$LABEL$4
I was here this past weekend for a charity event.  It was absolutely packed and the bartenders were working extra hard.  I mean literally breaking a sweat!    Despite it being very crowded$LABEL$4
Brixx$LABEL$3
Thoroughly unremarkable pizza but good beer selection earns Brixx an extra star.My bbq pizza's crust was just kind of dry and tasteless. But I could drink Stone beer among other brews I like so Brixx isn't a lost cause.$LABEL$3
Maybe I have ate at Brixx to many times$LABEL$3
Made my first visit to Brixx this past Friday night. Boy$LABEL$3
The pizzas my husband and I ordered were mediocre.  They were pretty greasy and I had the impression they had been sitting around for a while and just heated up before they were brought out to us.  I think this place is overpriced for the quality of food they serve.  The waitstaff was attentive.  I don't think we'll return.$LABEL$2
The Brixx location near the Time Warner Cable Arena gets two thumbs up from me! Stopped in for lunch before the Charlotte Checkers home opener and we were seated right away. Very convenient to park and walk between the arena and here. I had been to Brixx a few times before I was gluten free and have always been interested in trying their gluten free pizza. I was pretty impressed with their gluten free menu overall. It was very specific and easy to read. They offer not one$LABEL$4
There had been approximately a four year hiatus between my visits to Brixx. Despite the extended time between visits$LABEL$4
So I was looking for a place to eat my last meal in Charlotte and this restaurant came up on my phone. So i figured give it a try$LABEL$3
Lots happening in downtown Charlotte St. Patrick's weekend$LABEL$3
This is one of the few decent pizza places in Uptown Charlotte.  I have been here a handful of times with coworkers this past year.  They cook in a wood oven$LABEL$4
I came here with a group of friends before going to the Checkers game$LABEL$2
Meh...I don't get it. Brixx just didn't do it for me. A girlfriend and I stopped in Sunday afternoon. The place wasn't too busy and we were greeted with the good news that they offer $3 mimosas! The mimosas were good. But that's where the good stops...unfortunately. Yeah$LABEL$2
I wavered between two and three stars.  I think truthfully this is a 2.5 star place.   Nothing totally objectionable or inedible$LABEL$3
To my dearest Dylan$LABEL$5
I might not have liked the wood fried Pizza. Loved the starters though but not all. Three cheese was good (liked only two of them) and the bread sticks. In general pizza was ok.$LABEL$2
I absolutely LOVE the bronx bomber and the chilli they offer both great choices ! I eat here alot and it never fails to disappoint .. great salads the server knows my favorite \""supreme like\"" pizza ... they always give me healthy suggestions and alternatives to try. I love it. Very convenient and quick.. great atmosphere.  Some of the lunch staff could do a better job with timeliness and checking on the customers.$LABEL$5
I'd like to say it's a relative thing (I've had LOTS of really good and different types of pizza) but this was an ABSOLUTE thing - just really bad.  We had two pizzas - a classic (it was fine) and a new-age (Buffalo chicken).  The problems: crust had zero flavor$LABEL$1
Jerk chicken pizza was excellent. Bomber was good but the fresh oregano over powered everything else. Great beer selection. Service was good.$LABEL$4
Where to start ? The food is bad and overpriced$LABEL$1
When traveling$LABEL$2
WE stayed next door at the Hampton Inn but came to the American Grill for dinner. Service was excellent$LABEL$4
Nice hotel. Good beds. Across from NASCAR Hall of Fame.  Did not notice street noise mentioned in other reviews. Self-parking. Decent breakfast.Shares parking garage with Hampton Inn. Not a problem$LABEL$3
4 of 4 stars (Excellent$LABEL$4
Pay over 100 per night and still expect me to pay $10 bucks to park? Not again! Decent rooms$LABEL$3
(Stayed for a business convention)-Very pleasant staff at front desk. -Decent free cookies available in lobby.-Tasty free coffee in lobby.-Close to the Convention Center.-Close to Nascar HOF-Comfy pillows in the very large suite-Did not like the stench on the lower level by the restaurant that follows you in the hallways in the elevator and almost to my 3rd floor room(Smelled like old stale grease/ cafeteria cooking.)-I would prob try another hotel next time I'm in Charlotte just to see some comparison.$LABEL$3
Pros: - good location$LABEL$3
There are two things that are important to me in a hotel: cleanliness and service. This hotel meets both those criteria as my room was spotless upon arrival and they let me check-in at 10:30 am (standard time is 3 pm). It is very centrally located - literal overlooks the NASCAR museum (not that I would ever go there). Valet parking is $15$LABEL$5
I was in Charlotte for a class and stayed here. It was really nice$LABEL$5
Nice hotel close to everything downtown.  Shuttle service (complimentary) can take you anywhere in the city (but not the airport).    They have a nice cook-to-order breakfast option for $10.95$LABEL$4
What is there to say about Goat Wagon Grocery? It gets the job done. That's it. Need a Gatorade 'cause you're hungover? They've got it. Need beer so that you can get hungover? It's all there. Snacks$LABEL$3
The Goat Wagon Grocery has nothing going for it except its location. I shop here because it's the closest convenience store to my apartment.Negative experience #1:The store reeked of marijuana. Smoking's fine$LABEL$1
I live directly above the Goat Wagon so this store is sometimes a God send for myself. There have been so many times that I have been cooking dinner or have friends over and I realize I'm out of milk (or beer) and run downstairs to grab what I need. The staff is nice and they chat it up with you if you come in often. The prices are very high but it's a convenience store so it's not entirely a shock. The peeps that live or work nearby keep the store in business and there is sometimes an interesting crowd that gathers outside but if you're in need of a particular item or a frozen pizza for the night and don't feel like walking to The Teeter on 6th St.$LABEL$3
Ooh La La$LABEL$5
I've never had bad food or a bad experience at Capital Grille.  However$LABEL$3
The epitome of a pompous corporate steakhouse.  Go there to show your friends$LABEL$2
I came here the other day for a charity fundraiser$LABEL$3
Sorry- just doesn't do it for me.  The steak is average and it's over run by BoA middle management.$LABEL$2
Fine dining and elegant decor without the pretentious attitude.  Great happy hour bar with the famous \""Paul\"" bartending since 2004'.  Ask for a Stoli Doli Pineapple Martini and you will not regret it.  The Porcini Delmonico Steak and Lobster Mac n Cheese rule!!$LABEL$5
Review for drinks onlyStopped in on Saturday before dinner across the street.  Was sort of taken aback by 2 customers seated on the patio.  Both guys had on sports jerseys$LABEL$4
This place was ok$LABEL$3
I finally got a chance to eat here thanks to one of my friends very generous Christmas gift!! Ive only ever been in for drinks so dinner was a first!!We sat in a big booth for just the 3 of us and I started with the Pineapple Stoli Doli and it is dangerous! I could have had like 10...I didn't but i could have! We started with the Shrimp Cocktail and Wagyu Beef Carpaccio both were good. For my entree I had the Porcini Rubbed Delmonico Ribeye when it came out it was huge and perfectly cooked. We had gotten 3 sides starting with the Lobster Mac N Cheese which was very good$LABEL$4
I REAAAALY wanted to have one of the best steaks in a while$LABEL$3
I have now been here for dinner twice  and can fully commit to the 5 star rating!  In December a friend brought my sister and I here for our Xmas present.  LeeAnn D's review summs up that experience perfectly except she left out the bread basket.  I swear I could have been happy just sitting there eating bread all night$LABEL$5
This is a classic steak house.  Good service and great food. Go ahead- spend the extra money.  It's worth it.$LABEL$4
Top Notch steaks and service.  My recommendation (if you're really hungry) order the Porterhouse...medium rare.  And please pay the few extra dollars for the Porcini Rub - you'll thank me...   Table 23 is one of the best for privacy if you have 3 to 4 joining you..$LABEL$5
Service and steak fell short of expectations. No doubt this is a nice restaurant but our server was not attentive enough. She was no where to be found when we were ready to order and ready to pay. She did bring our wines out very quickly and made sure our glasses were filled. That I do appreciate. The steak$LABEL$3
Are you the type of person that requires being seen in an expensive$LABEL$2
If you don't like this place$LABEL$5
Classy joint with portraits of old men on the walls.ATMOSPHERE: Clean & classy$LABEL$4
Great service and wines. Best calamari in town$LABEL$5
My husband and I recently moved to Charlotte and we were looking for good food and our expectations were too high. The steaks were not seasoned at all$LABEL$3
One of the best Steakhouses$LABEL$5
I had a $40 filet mignon at Ruth Chris a few days before eating here.  For the same price$LABEL$5
It's been many years since we've been to The Capital Grille.  My employer used to treat us during the holidays after we worked 12-15 hour days/nights decorating the lobby for Christmas.  It was my first time trying calamari and the Stoli Doli - both sublime.  As was everything else I consumed.  I've been wanting to return since then$LABEL$5
I'm sorry Capital Grille I really wanted to give you four stars but I just couldn't bring myself to do it. Your dining room is very nice and your staff so very polite and accommodating as saints.I'll echo what Adam R. said and say that steakhouses are not usually my dining preference when choosing a place to eat at but I had really enjoyed the good eats at the Capital Grille Generous Pour event recently I decided to give it a shot. Warmly greeted at the door and reservations confirmed even though we had arrived a bit earlier than expected$LABEL$3
Somehow my review got moved to the Yelp event page. Reposting here...Every once in a while$LABEL$5
I have been to the Capital Grille the past 3 years for my birthday.  They know this so I get a call every year inviting me back and who am I to say no?  From the minute you walk into the restaurant to the time you leave it's like they put these rose colored glasses on you and all you see is the awesome atmosphere$LABEL$4
OK$LABEL$2
Really fantastic steaks and a lively upscale crowd make this downtown old school style steakhouse a winner. It's a meat lover's paradise and often has a bustling bar with upscale business people drinking $14 martinis and lots of talkative business crowds in the dining room. The decor is intentionally stuffy (old men oil paintings)$LABEL$5
I would give this place 2 1/2 stars but that wasn't an option so it got 3 instead.  The only reason it got 3 stars was because the desert$LABEL$3
Disappointing ... I really enjoy The Capital Grill most times and this experience left a poor taste for the Charlotte location. Our service and the food was$LABEL$2
I havent been here in about 8 years due to a bad meal I had long ago that I couldnt shake.  So I decided while I was Uptown having lunch to give it another go...it has been afterall about 8 years.  I have to say I was extremely impressed!  Everything was exceptional and well made.   Our waitress Alex was so sweet and knew the menu well and recommended the lobster bisque which wasnt on the menu.  It was perfection!  HUGE lumps of lobster meat swimming in a rich creamy broth.  OMG..it was so good.  Plus the truffle fries are the best Ive had in Charlotte so far!  The manger Bryce was so nice and accomodating.  He went out of his way to make the experience great.  Will not hesitate to return!$LABEL$5
After having experienced a business lunch at Capital Grill within the last year$LABEL$2
I went there this past Saturday night in a party of seven that included two kids (12 and 14). I did not know that they had valet parking as that would have been very useful on a busy uptown Saturday night. Anyway$LABEL$5
The best steakhouse of all the chains$LABEL$4
This is heaven for steak lovers like me! High quality and moody...I enjoyed my time very well.$LABEL$5
Took my husband here for his bday sometime in the beginning of November. I told then ahead of time that it was his birthday and the did really special things. It was expensive but he was happy the food was great and free v parking. Not bad at all would do it again. He says this place has the best steak. We even got a picture to take home.$LABEL$5
I dine here pretty regularly and it's always been amazing. My favorite thing on the menu is the lobster crab cakes. They're an appetizer but I love them so much I often order them as an entree. All the steaks are wonderful. Never had a bad meal here!$LABEL$5
Dropped in for lunch at an odd hour between lunch and dinner. The place was empty so we had the best server to ourselves and a great table.This is one of those places where even for lunch$LABEL$4
I've been dying to come here to get my steak on$LABEL$5
Came here before an opera of which the waiter was aware. We were courteously rushed but this was okay because we needed to leave at a certain time. Service was quick except when I received the check. It took a little bit for the waiter to pick up the payment and process it. The coffee was served with some spilled on the cup plate.$LABEL$4
I had never been to CG and decided to indulge myself a little while out of town on business. After a brief conversation with a foodie friend$LABEL$2
Great filet mignon. I had a chance to try their course meal in their Exchange Room. Some might consider the painting inside the Exchange Room a bit old school but if you appreciate fine art it will only make the experience better.And for those of you who are wondering how good their filet mignon is$LABEL$4
For my money$LABEL$5
I was Extremely disappointed  with Capital Grille. I dine there during Queen's Feast Restaurant Week yesterday. i was very excited because i only heard good things about the place . To Start the evening off there weren't any seat left inside the restaurant so we were escorted to a dining room outside the lobby. There were so many terrible things that occur that evening where do i begin. First the ceasar salad was the worst salad i have ever had it taste like a 2 day old bag salad you get at your local grocery store. it wasn't fresh$LABEL$1
Had a dinner date with my best friend here during restaurant week.  I've never been to Capital Grille so I was excited to try it out.  I have only heard good things so I can't say that I wasn't a little disappointed with a few things...I thought it would be safe to try a place like CG for Restaurant week because it is truly a chance to get more bang for your buck.  However$LABEL$3
This place is terrible. We chose to go out to eat here as we had only heard great things about Capital Grille. We will never return to this establishment for a meal again. Our waiter was very nice and the decor of the restaurant is beautiful as well. For starters I got the mozzarella basil tomato salad. It was pretty good so no complaints there. I chose the special of the night for my entree which was three small steaks prepared in three signature ways. I loved two of them the balsamic one was pretty bad but not inedible. Our water glasses were left empty several times which I thought was weird considering how much a meal like this costs. My husband ordered the porterhouse and he asked for it to be medium. Well it was bordering on the side of well-done and I tasted his and didn't like it at all. He thought it was very dry and it wasn't hot it seemed as though it had been sitting around before they brought it out to us. Honestly the steaks he grills from Teeter have more flavor than this dish. This was obviously very disappointing but we just thought ok not worth the money but we would possibly return for the specialty dishes at a future date. The main reason I am giving a one star review is because I woke up in the middle of the night with awful stomach pains and have been sick for the past 10 hours. My husband was nauseas but not as sick as me.  We didn't sleep practically at all last night and because of this i would never ever return here. I would recommend grilling steaks on your own grill and not wasting a ton of money to get an underwhelming sickening experience.$LABEL$1
We were greeted with \"" Happy Annversiary\"" and two glasses of Champagne.  I though the champagne was actually quite delicious.  We had lobster-crab cakes for appetizers.  There was quite a bit of lobster in the cakes and they were scrumptious.  We shared a 10 oz Filet  which was plenty for us.  It was cooked to perfection.  We had scalloped potatoes and asparagus which we took home left overs.  They had one of our favorite wines from Chandon Domaine which I have not seen in a resturant before. They brought us out 2 small desserts: one on each end of plate with Happy Anniversary in the middle.  They took our picture with their camera and provided us with the picture.  Our waiter was superb along with the service.  The managers made sure we were happy by checking on us several times.$LABEL$5
Took the wife for a nice dinner at Capital Grille.  I love the confirmation email you get when making the reservation.  The place was a little busy and our table wasn't ready despite a reservation so we went to the bar.  Paul the bartender served us stoli doli's(sp?)$LABEL$4
This is my favorite steakhouse! Their appetizers$LABEL$5
Need no occasion$LABEL$5
I came to the Blumenthal Cancer Center after Dr. Higgins was highly recommended.  I have had a less than stellar experience.  He's a gynecological oncologist.  I had a biopsy done a month ago & no one from Dr. Higgins office bothered to call with the results.  I'm waiting to find out of my pre-cancerous cells have become cancerous and no one will return my calls!  Finally after 2 1/2 weeks a nurse from another Dr in the Center returned my call & read my chart and said I may need surgery.  A week or two goes by$LABEL$2
Excellent Health Care$LABEL$5
For a fabulous$LABEL$4
I have to admit that the Bobcats are a very far distant second team for me behind the Celtics. However$LABEL$4
Went to my first NBA game last night$LABEL$4
We had awesome box seats complete with some tasty snacks and beverages. While I don't claim to know much about Basketball ...(or anything really)$LABEL$5
Had an opportunity to be wined and dined (or beer and dined) by the Bobcats last night. I've been to a number of NBA arena's and while the team isn't doing so great$LABEL$4
Was at the bobcats game last night and it was alot of fun.  The only thing i would have to say is that it felt like you were out of the game experience sitting in the suites.  The T-shirts didnt make it to us$LABEL$4
I've reviewed the arena and its secondary tenant$LABEL$4
Went a year ago and had a great time$LABEL$1
Go team!Last game of the season$LABEL$3
To quote ESPN... \""c'mon man!\""  How about putting a decent product on the floor.  And where is Michael Jordan?  Does he attend games?  The night we went they were playing the Celtics.  BTW$LABEL$2
I'm giving the Bobcats 3 stars because I don't love them$LABEL$3
Charlotte finally has the Hornets back for the 2014/15 season! The name Hornets is important to Charlotte$LABEL$3
Don't think this place is more than it is$LABEL$4
Thinking about Matthew Broderick perhaps?  Erase that thought; this bar didn't really remind me of my college experience at all either.  There were too many meatheads$LABEL$2
Good old Stool Pigeons.  This is THE place to be for football Sundays.  There is cheap draft beer and a multitude of TVs to watch.Be aware that on days when the Panthers play at home (8 blocks away) you need to get there early to get a good seat (in this case$LABEL$4
Okay$LABEL$4
I would consider Stool Pigeons a sports bar$LABEL$3
Okay$LABEL$2
Good cheap bar food$LABEL$4
Nice antiquey (if thats a word) atmosphere$LABEL$3
So I think this place might be better as a bar than a restaurant$LABEL$2
Maybe it's because I went on a Thursday with colleagues$LABEL$1
Came here for lunch and we saw a waitress go by with a couple of huge pizzas and we asked what it was and she told us that it was the special: personal pizza with one topping for $4.99. When our waitress came over$LABEL$3
If you live nearby and are looking for a casual sports bar to watch games and drink beer$LABEL$2
Generic$LABEL$2

I don't read daily print papers.  Why get your hands dirty with newsprint when you can cleanly browse stories online.  But I do pick up The Eye on occasion which is a free weekly also published by the Observer.  It's a fair middle of the road entertainment rag that basically tells you what you already knew$LABEL$3
Ehhh...the Charlotte Observer may be the best we have around town in the form of a newspaper$LABEL$3
I'm echoing Nick here. While this is probably the best newspaper in town$LABEL$3
The Disturber is double the price it used to be yet now it take me half the time to read it. Not a good bang for the buck or should I say 2 bucks for Sundays paper. Sundays paper sometimes is no bigger than a big city's week day paper. Use to be you kicked back with Sundays paper and it would take several hours to read it all. Not any more$LABEL$2
It's always iffy regarding the daily delivery of the paper.  The circulation and delivery staff are inept and incompetent.  When you try to speak with staff regarding this problem$LABEL$1
This had to be the worst newspaper in the world.  I have never dealt with such complete incompetence from a company.I had the paper delivered for a few months.  They don't call you or stop the paper$LABEL$1
Just another liberal bias rag.   It's only redeeming use$LABEL$1
I've taken home delivery for over 30 years and the last year has a terrible one. I had at least 5 days with no delivery and at least 8 wet papers. I have a observer install paper box but it isn't used much instead they put paper in a thin plastic bag that will not keep water out and throw paper in my wet grass or driveway. In past it they would try to deliver a paper that day but not any longer$LABEL$1
The last year of home delivery of this newspaper is the worst I have ever seen.  When you call to complain$LABEL$1
Savannah Red is such a hidden gem! I was pleased to know that the servers$LABEL$5
Holy unprofessional$LABEL$2
I was extremely disappointed! I went to Savannah Red back in 2005 for a Valentine's Day dinner. It wasn't awful back then but I have been back until a few weeks ago when my friends wanted to go for Restaurant week. I was surprised at the choice of restaurant - since it is not a popular spot in uptown but went along anyway. It was the worst dining experience I have had in a long time. The waitress hung on our chairs while taking orders$LABEL$1
Wow. Wonderful food and impeccable service. I will be coming back. First things first: kudzu butter$LABEL$5
Say it with me now - Krispy Kreme Bread Pudding. When I first told one of my friends about this dessert$LABEL$4
I took a chance and entertained a very important customer at Savannah Red. \""In a Marriott??$LABEL$4
This lovely restaurant near the BOA Headquarters and the business district is a surprisingly excellent restaurant in a hotel at the Marriott. The service was exquisite$LABEL$4
Yeah$LABEL$3
The worst service ever.I was staying in the Charlotte Marriott - where Savannah Red is located - for the Democratic Convention. I worked on events at both Conventions having come from Tampa where the Republicans held theirs. I'd been in the concierge lounge with a couple friends where I'd had 2 drinks. We made our way down to the restaurant and sat at the bar to grab something to eat before we set out on our evening. We were having a fun conversation and laughing and when we ordered$LABEL$1
Gourmet Soul Food? I love it. Who would have thought such a nice little gem would be hidden inside the Charlotte Marriott. We had some very artistic chefs with us since we were all here for the Research Chefs Association's annual conference. No pressure to the chef since we didn't say anything until half way through the meals. They started us out with a complimentary smoked salmon torte. Some great appetizers$LABEL$5
I wish I could give this quarter stars. I was torn about how I should rate this restaurant because some of my food here was excellent but some could have been better. I still gave it a four star review because it was certainly better than 'a-ok' but a four seems to be a bit of a stretch. If I had total freedom$LABEL$4
Was thrilled to try Savannah Red as a part of Queen's Feast$LABEL$4
Avoid this place at all costs. The food is disgusting. I honestly never had food this horrible in my entire life. From the frozen crab cakes to the unseasoned grouper.. my experience left me confused and hungry. This is simply a Marriott hotel restaurant - not an award winning restaurant by any means.$LABEL$1
Truly. Meh. The Cutter's Cigar Bar is nice$LABEL$2
This hotel restaurant is fantastic. I will say with 100% confidence that this is the best breakfast that I have ever had. The omelet station is superb and the breakfast potatoes are full of flavor. They were very patient with my 3 children and were very helpful. I can't wait to stay here again.$LABEL$5
Dark.Mysterious.Sexy.Uncertainty.There is nothing more intriguing than the dimly lit$LABEL$3
Sinatra in the background. Rich$LABEL$4
Where do I start. It was a friend's 30th birthday so we wanted to go somewhere and light up a cigar to celebrate. Given Cutters is one of the few (if not only) indoor cigar smoking bars/options$LABEL$1
The service here is phenomenal. People are very friendly and seem genuinely eager to help. The collection of whiskey and cigars is decent. But$LABEL$4
I enjoyed Cutters! Nice decor; reminds me of a room George Vanderbilt would have at the Biltmore house for after dinner drinks and cigars. Good background jazz music!There is a good selection of cigars and the service was great!I had an Absinthe cocktail. Absinthe is something I've only read about and seen on TV. I as curious about how it tasted.It is a strong drink$LABEL$5
\""A woman is a woman but a good cigar is always a smoke\""Cutters is hands down the classiest cigar lounge I have been to.  From Australia to Singapore and London to NYC$LABEL$5
Don't bother with this place. What a joke. We had a seat at the bar$LABEL$1
I have been here on several occasions.  The atmosphere is nice.  It can get a little loud$LABEL$3
I recently was putting together a city guide for some clients coming into town. They were staying right near the Epi Center so most of the bars and restaurants in the guide where there. However$LABEL$4
Don't bother going. Walked in very excited to enjoy a cigar & watch the game. No TV's!  They said they didn't want to take away from their sports bar$LABEL$1
Not being a really big cigar guy$LABEL$4
Cigar lounge that truly deserves the name. Don't get fooled by by Marriott location. Great staff$LABEL$5
I really enjoyed this place.  It has outstanding customer service and a very appealing atmosphere including lots of leather furniture.  Great ventilation with all the cigar smoking.  The only thing this place was missing was TV which I experience at other cigar lounges.   Overall$LABEL$4
I have recently moved to Charlotte from Manhattan where I used to go to Club Macanudo$LABEL$3
This is one of my favorite locations. It was 2011 since my last visit and Katie remembered me from previous visits$LABEL$5
The cigar prices are marked up substantially$LABEL$4
Bank of America Stadium is home to my favorite sports team The Panthers.  If you are from out of town and you have never been here$LABEL$4
I think it's magic that this place can be in the middle of uptown and somehow$LABEL$4
Home of the Panthers! WOOOO HOOOO!I really like this stadium$LABEL$4
Still five stars.  Had the opportunity to take chickie's son to his first game Sunday.  Awesome experience even though we were blown out by Tennessee.  Amazing to see how the fans act in Charlotte.  So much class and comraderie.  Go Panthers!!!!$LABEL$5
I went today to watch the Panthers play their home opener VS. the New Orleans Saints.  The game was fun and we had a good time.  The Panthers need to do something about getting people into the stadium.  It was raining a bit before the game and the game started at 1:00.  12:45 is when I arrived at the West Gate to enter and I finally got into my seat around 1:20.  It took FOREVER to get in$LABEL$3
Went to a Panthers game and was a great time.  Easy access from numerous parking spots nearby.  And the area seems safe$LABEL$4
As a Panther's fan$LABEL$4
From an architectural standpoint$LABEL$3
You know when owners and fans ask for a new stadium?  You know how it's usually the owner...and they want the city to chip in?  Bank of America Stadium could be on the poster for that exact scenario.What I don't get about the stadium is how it's really not that old...and it's just sad in general.  It's as if they picked this stadium out of a Sears catalog and plopped it in uptown.  As far as stadiums go...I'm not sure I've been to one with less personality.Bank of America Stadium serves its purpose...but so does the Goodwill and Taco Bell...and I'll bet you don't do all your shopping and eating at those establishments.$LABEL$2
The stadium and game were a pleasant surprise - the crowd had energy$LABEL$4
Stadium is in the heart of downtown$LABEL$3
WOW! What a great venue$LABEL$4
Bank of America Stadium is average!  Not great$LABEL$3
Solid stadium and the higher seats have a surprisingly good view. The video is great and the sound is decent and a Panthers win always makes the experience much more memorable.$LABEL$4
Enjoyed being at the Bank of America Stadium but the usher in our section was a complete and total Ahole. We were sitting in section 513 in row 1A. As my buddy was walking up the steps$LABEL$1
I used to come to Charlotte a lot when I was more of a \""Bang All Of America Stadium\"" kind of guy$LABEL$3
Norwood$LABEL$5
I LOVE my Panthers$LABEL$3
great team$LABEL$5
It's been a long time since 2003/2004 when the Panthers went to the Super Bowl.The Cardiac Cat's made a huge move on 12/22/13 when they took down the Saints 17-13 to take control of the NFC South.With 55 seconds remaining$LABEL$5
It was nice as usual$LABEL$4
A resident of the Charlotte Metro Area for over 9 years$LABEL$3
Frankie's used to be my favortie Italian food in town$LABEL$3
If there were a two and a half star$LABEL$3
I met up with friends for a birthday gathering at Frankie's.  It was my first time and$LABEL$4
Are u kidding me $53 for a mediocre meal!!!!! That was nothing short of robbery. Dot get me wrong the interior design was great I just wish the food was good also!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$2
Just an update. I have been back many times. The Mac N Cheese is the way to go here. it's amazing! Definitely try this if you are in town for lunch.$LABEL$4
Tried Chicks for lunch a few weeks ago and was not impressed. The 2 staff working were very friendly$LABEL$2
Great take out spot conveniently located in the Latta Arcade. Never takes more than 5 minutes to get my food even during the lunch rush. Pricing could be a dollar cheaper in my opinion but the bourbon chicken special is fantastic.$LABEL$5
I'm not really a bar goer$LABEL$3
Cool Irish spot with a new outdoor patio. No food and a limited draft and bottled beer selection.  Free WiFi.  The hostess is gorgeous so I would drink there anytime.$LABEL$3
Pleasant little Irish-style place$LABEL$3
Only two stars due to the lack of selection.  No food menu and inside is like a dungeon.  They do have a nice outside area with TVs and a rather secluded environment.  One of these stars is because of their Sunday special.  $4 Car Bomb shots!!  Other than that$LABEL$2
My favorite Irish bar in Charlotte and probably the friendliest bartenders I've ever met.  I'm no beer connoisseur but apparently they have the best Guinness in Charlotte because of the short length of the line from the keg to the tap.  I've tried it and I can at least concur it is good!The only take away for me was the lack of lighting in the place$LABEL$4
The beer selection leaves a lot to be desired. Also$LABEL$3
Amazing bar.  Great ambiance / style / set up.   Great beer and drink selection.   Also has a wonderful covered outdoor sitting area that is quite large.   Loved this bar!$LABEL$4
I know Guinness is the Irish staple but I assume they drink other beers too. The selection here is horrible. The service was friendly and the place seems to always have a crowd but I just cannot figure out why.$LABEL$2
Average bar with a nice outdoor area. You can go cornholing there which is fun.Wish the beer selection was better.$LABEL$3
Darkest bar in Charlotte! No need to clean up the place just keep the light down extremely low and no one will see the bar scum on the floors. II don't think its that dirty but seriously I don't really know for sure because they keep that place like a damn cave$LABEL$4
So far I like it.$LABEL$5
Phfff. Not sure what the point of this place is other than to watch people watch sports events on the upper level 'cause that's what  I spent much of my time doing until about midnight whereupon I switched to watching drunken wallflowers dance in a corner while everyone else just stood around shouting over each other. Typical bar. Glad i had a few in me before making it here otherwise i would not have been entertained. Wear you jammies here kids cause it won't matter the next day anyway.$LABEL$3
Had a blast at Connolly's on Fifth.  Was in uptown for work and walked over to the bar with some co-workers.  We visited on a Tuesday and it had a nice size crowd for  a Tuesday night.  We went for a few drinks and ended up staying until the lights came on! Walked in and instantly felt at home.  Its a dark bar with typical Irish bar decor.  Bartenders were very friendly and easy to get their attention.  Great beer selection and everybody was super friendly. Will definetely be back.$LABEL$5
TRASH. I can't tell you about the bartenders. But I can let you know the door man and some other bounces are not pleasant. I've been here a few times. It compares to Dandelion but about 10 times trashier with staff who don't really care about there customers.$LABEL$1
I hate this place especially the bouncer justin who refused to let me enter the establishment because I was wearing a UK polo. He said he was a unc fan and couldn't let me in because I would start stuff. I tired to talk to the manager before he laid his hands on me and threw me into the street nearly getting hit by a mini van. I tried calling management to express my opinion of the psychopath they have working the front door but the number does not work anymore. Further more I will never return because of the people this place chooses to hire.$LABEL$1
This to me is about the experience if you are with friends$LABEL$2
Very crowded$LABEL$2
I was not very impressed with this place.  Walked in and immediately felt like I was working in a waste water treatment plant.  I cannot believe the employees can take the smell.  Had to go outside after getting a beer to make it work.  If they clean this place up$LABEL$1
We spent NYE's at Connelys. It was...Okay. Honestly$LABEL$3
So$LABEL$3
I went to Ruby Tuesday the other day because my 83 year old great aunt took me out to lunch$LABEL$3
The Colony & Sharon location closed.$LABEL$3
Worst experience I've ever had in my life at the Carolina place mall beware!!! The receptionists are very rude and one of them hung up on me before telling me that maybe she might get back to me? What kind of business are these people trying to run?$LABEL$1
Fastest year of my life! The growth panel is complete and we couldn't be happier. The last session was the most fun. Since our daughter has started experiencing separation anxiety I didn't think we'd get huge laughs and smiles. I was wrong. Jeff and Becky worked really well with her and helped direct me to get the best shots. They had great toys that she responded enthusiastically toward. When I returned for the proof appt it was difficult to pay attention because I had my daughter with me and she was all over the place. Becky walked with her to the next room where they had more toys and I listened to them play... she didn't cry (remember she's been having separation anxiety). She actually had a fun time. They were really nice and patient with us.$LABEL$5
It took me about a year of living in Charlotte before friends clued me in to this best kept secret.THE BEST BURGER anyone has served me in Charlotte -- right here$LABEL$5
I  read on their Facebook page that they just celebrated their 37th birthday$LABEL$4
Old school charm$LABEL$4
Although Arthur's offers a good variety of options$LABEL$2
Arthur's is a pretty good eat. I didn't even know this place existed$LABEL$4
The bagels here aren't as good as everyone said they would be. I actually think I like the Einstein's Bagel's bagel-cream cheese combo better. I personally prefer the plain bagel and cream cheese over the egg sandwiches because the eggs are kind of weird and microwavy tasting. The nice thing about this location is that it's on the 2nd floor of the epicenter and you can get there directly from the Aloft.They have some very good deals on breakfast bagels that are CHEAPER than Smoothie King. Damn you delicious expensive smoothies!Tip: I wasted $2 on a very very disgusting and watered down Iced Coffee. Avoid at all costs. Minus 1 star for that.$LABEL$2
THIS PLACE IS SLAMMED ALL THE TIME! Never without a line$LABEL$3
The other day$LABEL$2
I used to love Bruegger's bagels$LABEL$1
There's a reason I avoid bagel sandwiches but I thought I'd give it another try. I ordered the Thai Chicken Sandwich which consists of a plain bagel smeared with cream cheese$LABEL$2
If you're in a hurry$LABEL$2
I have been coming to this location since 2006 when our office relocated to this area. I have always enjoyed excellent service from the staff and management. I visit at least 2 times a day. One thing I couldn't and still can't  understand is why they continue to have the turn over in staff especially management. These are people who make your day and have brought a smile to my face whenever I've had a bad day. I would hire any number of them at any time. I have driven past other locations just because I enjoy the atmosphere and staff at this location. No longer. Their most recent management change has left the place without a soul. It's a change that you can sense  and see ( they did  some lite remodeling)  when you walk in the door. This was the day after her abrupt departure. This individual was always here to fill in for staff or to make sure the place was taken care of. She was here in the snow storm this year. Amazing right? I'm a bottomless member and got ten people from work to buy them from here bc I enjoyed this place and it's service. I will not be getting one next year and doubt I will frequent as much in the future. It's not the same! As I'm wiping down my own table to sit down$LABEL$2
This brueggs kinda sucks. Every time I've come they are out of multiple kinds of bagels so someone isn't doing their counts correctly (use to work at a brueggers). The service is lousy. Also apparently brueggers discontinued sprouts-not this stores fault but wtf?! Sprouts are awesome. Going to Poppy's next time.$LABEL$2
Horrible. This used to be a great place to grab some great breakfast and coffee$LABEL$1
Huge bar$LABEL$2
Pretty big fan of this place on Friday night$LABEL$4
I'll agree that Buckhead is probably fun if you're wasted. Unfortunately$LABEL$2
Basically$LABEL$2
Buckhead is Buckhead. It's a college bar$LABEL$3
Alright$LABEL$3
I haven't been to Buckhead Saloon since 2/09. Me and a few friends decided to go last night. I usually have a good time when I go to Buckhead. If you don't wanna pay a cover$LABEL$4
Buckhead Saloon; The Worst Jack-hole in Charlotte$LABEL$1
Great bartenders$LABEL$4
Perfectly fine bar located uptown amongst some other more upscale places.  I can't really find bad things to say about the place as I've only visited a handful of times and each time has been fun and service at the bar$LABEL$3
Yet another SF snob$LABEL$4
I am not an \""SF snob\$LABEL$2
This seems to be one of the many places in Charlotte where it comes highly recommended$LABEL$2
Went here as the \""fancy installment\"" during a recent trip to Charlotte.  We went based on local word of mouth$LABEL$3
Not a bad place but there are many others in Charlotte that are better. We where seated at a table so close to another couple that we might as well have eaten dinner with them. So if you are looking for atmosphere$LABEL$2
Enjoyable dinner place. I found some surprising entries on the wine list$LABEL$4
I should know better than to eat seafood in a restaurant that is land locked. My friend and I decided to take advantage of a Groupon that i had purchased and roll it into a \""date night\"". He had never been and what better way to try out a new restaurant. Our server was really nice and touted that they're known for their seafood$LABEL$2
In a sea of pretty great restaurants$LABEL$3
I really enjoyed the food at this place however the service could use a little work. The oysters and mussels were excellent and the filet melts in your mouth. Having to wait a really long time for our server to bring a bottle of wine and take our order knocked this place down to 4 out of 5 stars.$LABEL$4
**The address is 214 N Tryon$LABEL$3
(Note: LaVecchia's has moved to Hearst Tower$LABEL$3
Service$LABEL$3
The service was good but that's about it.  My tuna was cold and was not cooked well. The rice was the best part of the meal. Definitely not worth the prices. Steak was over cooked. Croutons were rock hard. Deserts tasted store bought. Atmosphere was casual but prices were upscale.$LABEL$2
Pecan-crusted mahi-mahi I love you but DANG you are expensive!!!  Having been at the new location twice now$LABEL$3
Not great but just ok.  Backed oysters were above average but the yellowfin tuna was unremarkable.  New York steak was not as tender as it should have been.  I think they did not serve Choice cuts.$LABEL$3
Was in Charlotte for a couple days and heard this place was a must try. My boyfriend and I went and had an amazing time! I started off with the calamari and it was absolutely perfect - best I've had! My boyfriend had the Cajun crab and shrimp dip and fell in love - the portion was quite hearty. For dinner I had the almond crusted tilapia and he had the special pepper crusted ahi tuna. His tuna was perfectly cooked and the sticky rice was perfection. My tilapia was good but the mash potatoes$LABEL$5
Located in Uptown and easy to access$LABEL$2
The food was pretty good$LABEL$2
We sat at the bar and only ate oysters$LABEL$3
My boyfriend hit the nail on the head when he described LaVecchia's as the Applebees of nice restaurants. There are so many fabulous places to have a nice dinner in Charlotte and this did not impress. I have a fabulous Lobster Bisque - creamy shellfish soup$LABEL$3
We have been to LaVecchia's several times with this being our first review.  Parking is easy and dry in the Hearst tower and with LaVecchia validating a ticket it is free.  The walk/ride down is nice and the atmosphere is great with businessfolk$LABEL$4
We were ten minutes late for our reservation$LABEL$4
We just went here last night because of charlotte restaurant week and wanting to try a different upscale restaurant.  The experience was nothing close to nice or upscale.  We arrived and were promptly seated by a friendly hostess$LABEL$1
Just nothing to write home about. I knew we were in trouble when we asked the waiter where the oysters were from and his response was \"" somewhere up north I think\"". The fried oyster rockerfeller were very good. We were pretty much the only ones in there. I might stop back for a drink and an app$LABEL$2
I went to LaVecchia's for the first time EVER just a few weeks ago. I had heard so-so reviews from friends so I was a bit skeptical at first but thought that the dinner was very nice! The entrees that my date and I ordered did take a little long because they were very busy but we just enjoyed our appetizer in the meantime so it didn't bother us at all. The manager even bought us a bottle of wine for us because we had waited \""so long\"". Score! The service was on-point and our waitress was incredibly friendly and helped us out with suggestions when ordering. I'll be back to LaVecchia's!$LABEL$4
Hidden within Overstreet Mall$LABEL$3
The service is great$LABEL$2
I Asked for a Mount and Balance from them and had a good laugh.  I buy my tires from the Tire Rack(online) and Goodyear quoted me $154 dollars just to put the tires on!I'd Highly recommend Kirby & Kale in the Elizabeth Area. They did the same service for $40.$LABEL$1
I'm certainly no expert on tire prices$LABEL$3
Not againA few simple items turned into a large bill. I thought the charges were excessive and questionable services  that they stated I needed. I unfortunatey did not have time for my routine mechanic$LABEL$1
I am surprised that this location has a 1 star rating. The few reviews it has seem to be outdated by a few years$LABEL$3
We took our car in for its yearly inspection. To our surprise$LABEL$1
DO NOT take your car here unless you want something messed up!!! Took my car in for an oil change and was told my brake fluids would need changing for an extra 75 bucks.  Saw the oil light on my car go off in a few weeks but took off getting it looked at for another few weeks.  Found a nice surpise later that the cap wasnt screwed on right from the last oil change and car had engine damage.  These guys are the WORST shop in Charlotte.$LABEL$1
They scratched my car. A big one and my bad that I didn't notice it while picking up the car. What more I have to say?$LABEL$1
Took my car in to get a quote on the brakes$LABEL$1
Let me start by saying it's a bus station. Automatically means dim lighting$LABEL$2
a tip: if you need anything from this local charlotte station don't call.  they never -- as in never -- answer their phone.  you can't leave messages$LABEL$2
Oh greyhound$LABEL$2
So yeah$LABEL$2
Can't complain much about this station. I'm here for a 50 minute layover and the place seems clean$LABEL$3
Bused my Dad up from Augusta to Charlotte. Really no competition here so we were at their mercy. My Dad said he had a good trip and that they were nice to him as he needs handicap assistance. Station is relatively clean for a bus station. It IS confusing in there and it's not exactly obvious which line to stand in so that you catch the right bus. And you can't track where the bus is using a smartphone or computer. But it was affordable but the schedule was somewhat inconvenient. He made it here and back safely so i guess that is what ultimately matters.$LABEL$3
For a bus station$LABEL$3
Probably better known as a nightlife hot spot$LABEL$3
Dropped into Cosmos last night for dinner before the Michael Buble concert.  It was a nightmare.  First and foremost$LABEL$1
No idea how this place is for food. Just went here to drink and party. It's quite a scene. Various nights have different types of music. Was there on a Wednesday when they played 80s music (LMAO) and then again on Thursday when they had salsa. They smoke here too but it's not as awful as some places with no air circulation. My favorite part about this place...no cover charge. God bless the South. Drinks were reasonable$LABEL$3
Cosmos Cafe is yet another venue that is really a restaurant$LABEL$3
A lot of people (girls) I know love this place$LABEL$2
Cosmos is one if my go to places for some affordable eats before an event or a show uptown. My girlfriends and I thoroughly enjoy the half-price martinis on Wednesdays - my personal fave is the pineapple upside-down martini. Mmmm tastes like cake! Who doesn't like cake in a glass? I've eaten a variety of dishes on the menu and each dish I've had was both tasty and affordable enough to come back. Some of my favorites are the Fried Goat Cheese Salad$LABEL$4
My husband and I headed over early on a Tuesday night.  To our surprise it is buy one get one tapas until 7 so upon realizing our luck we opted for 4 items to test the place out.  We were glad we did.1)  Chicken satay: chicken was tender and the seasonings were minimal but the peanut sauce looked like it was scooped out of a jar$LABEL$2
I work in ITC. Some great places in the area. I'd consider Cosmo's as worth it$LABEL$4
Ate at cosmos on a Thursday bogo on tapas ordered chicken quesadilla n needed more sour cream n was charged 50 cent! Ridiculous I will never patronize again. Also the food is just ok not the greatest they should b glad u stop in with all the other choices.$LABEL$1
Don't waste your time. I came here mid afternoon to be greeted by an entirely empty restaurant. That should have been my first sign$LABEL$2
Yeeeeaah$LABEL$2
Go sit at the Bar.  The drinks are great and the SUSHI is very good.  The women in there are smokin hot.$LABEL$4
Never been here for food but I hear people rave about their lunches here and specifically the artichoke dip and chips.  All my experiences have been for after work drinks or night time social settings.  That being said$LABEL$4
Recently had lunch at Cosmos Cafe in uptown. I ordered the Steak Frites and wasn't asked how I'd like the steak cooked. It came prepared okay$LABEL$2
Met some friends for dinner/happy hour. Bogo tapas before 7pm was a draw. Ordered the Crostini and Crab con Queso...both were excellent. The burgers were great as well. This place has a cool$LABEL$4
This place has everything!  Popped in for lunch with a friend and a drink or few.  We sat at the bar in the center of the place and spoke with the very friendly bartender for suggestions.  She suggested a sushi lunch plate which we ended up sharing and the drink special.  Since the sushi chief worked right behind where we were stationed we got to watch the whole plate get created.  After a few rounds of the daily drink special we walked out tipsy and full for around $10 each$LABEL$3
Oh Cosmos you were so empty on a Friday night but you still managed to be a ton of fun as a first stop! Your margaritas tasted nice$LABEL$3
I have been to Cosmos' twice in my 18 years in North Carolina.  I must say the first time was a better experience.  I went during the CIAA the gratuity was 20%.  A grilled chicken sandwich cost me $11.00 (overpriced)$LABEL$2
It's a bar with fun latin nights.Haven't had the food but if you know how to salsa$LABEL$3
Not impressed.  Went for lunch with a group.  No one really bragged about their meal$LABEL$2
Definitely a fun place to go...but dress code is way too strict during night club time.  Apparently you have to have a collar shirt to get it...I've worn regular shirts (nice ones of course) many times and had no problem getting in.  Oh well$LABEL$2
I went to Cosmos once for lunch$LABEL$2
Great place to salsa dance on a Saturday night!!  A brief lesson is given by some great professionals-check it out!!$LABEL$4
I stopped in here for lunch. The food was just average and service was awful. They were very understaffed - it took about 10 minutes for the server to take my order$LABEL$2
Staff was very friendly. But food and drinks were disappointing. This place markets itself as \""Martini specialists\"" but I had to ask for my martini to be remade a second time as it came without olives. Also - olives were standard jarred fair. A much better martini can be had at \""Urban Sip\"" above the Ritz - they have Spanish giant olives hand-stuffed with blue cheese.$LABEL$2
Went here for my sister-in-law's birthday party and had a great time.  The staff was super friendly and had everything set up in fairly short order.  No complaints really.$LABEL$4
Great coffee/treats and a perfect location for a meeting away from the cube farm if you work in the Bank of America Plaza or Corporate Center. Of course$LABEL$4
Good stop station for a quick afternoon pick me up or a morning boost.  Service has always been good.  Caribou is probably in my top 5 coffee spots but something about the company in general just isn't appealing enough to search it out and grab a cup over and above DD or Starbucks.  Nothing specific$LABEL$3
Convenient parking and great exhibit - Body Worlds. The IMAX is wonderful - beware lots of kids everywhere!$LABEL$4
Here are some tips to make your visit to Discovery more pleasant:Go early morning to avoid the crowds. Reserve 2-3 hours to enjoy the museum. Plan ahead which exhibits you must attend and go there first. Suggestions:* Toddlers and young kids: KidsPlace room$LABEL$4
I used to go here all the time on field trips in elementary school & I always looked forward to those trips. But like some others have said$LABEL$4
Like Ryan Matthew P.$LABEL$3
Great job on the remodeling$LABEL$4
Took my nephews here on Saturday afternoon.  Had only been once before the remodel.  They did a nice job$LABEL$3
If I were a ten year old girl I'd have had the time of my life at this museum.  You see$LABEL$3
Took my almost three-year old here and while they had one great room full of activities(water$LABEL$2
I can see why they bring the school kids here.There are a lot of hands on type of items for kids to play with and \""discover\"" things.  There was also demonstration - little shows - with a host in different topics.  My friend and I watched the subzero and part of the electricity one.  The subzero one is quite cool since the guy played with liquid nitrogen.While we were there$LABEL$3
As someone in their twenties$LABEL$5

The Discovery Place exceeded our expectations. We heard about this and decided to check it out on our way out of town. There is soo much to see that it's a little overwhelming. Our kids are on the younger side (5 and 3) and can't read yet so some of the science things they didn't get or understand. The staff is very helpful and willing to help you with the experiments. We loved the little kid area where we could put our baby down so she could explore too! Cafeteria and parking is over priced but the cost of admission is totally worth it. Be prepared to spend at least 4 hours wandering around. Great museum! We will be visiting again!$LABEL$5
\""It was really nice....but probably shouldn't be on the top 5\"" We spent a weekend in Charlotte with our family of five$LABEL$3
We visited Discovery Place on the Monday after Easter.  We were there very close to opening time since we weren't sure if it would get crowded with Spring Breakers.  We had the second floor mostly to ourselves for a good 25 minutes or so.  We got to see and try a lot of things that probably had waits later on.  The museum is really nicely laid out and decorated with kids in mind.  Bathrooms seemed plentiful and well placed.  Our 6 year old had a good time running around trying the different exhibits.  I'm not sure he \""learned\"" a lot$LABEL$3
Hands on learning.  This is my kind of place.  I write this review by comparing it to other science museums that I've been to.What keeps Discovery Place from being one of the more exciting science museums...is that it's relatively the same every time I go.Sure there's some new stuff...but some of the old stuff just needs to go.  My son loves science and engineering...and with the exception of some of the upstairs activities$LABEL$3
Terrific interactive science museum for kids (and adults) of all ages. We took our kids along with some friends from out of town$LABEL$4
This is a great place to take kids on a rainy day. My niece and nephew were visiting and everything with outdoor fun was closed due to the thunderstorms - so we went to brunch and then hit this place.They had a ball and learned a lot too. The Frog and Alien exhibits were open when we were there and they really liked those.Make sure you go too all the different levels because there are many little hidden spots. Kids may not want to sit still for the IMAX movies$LABEL$5
SCIENCE ON THE ROCKS!  What a great idea.  Friday nights once a month$LABEL$5
Needed to burn a few hours & decided to check out Discovery Place. It seemed like my hubs & I were the only adults without children there. When in Rome.... We had a blast with all the kids. December is nutrition month. I really like the fat to muscle displays. There was a ton to do & I could have spent several more hours playing in all the exhibits. I loved how hands on the exhibits are for everyone. I also loved that some of the \""apprentices\"" are kids. Fantastic learning experience for them. Because I am a biologist$LABEL$5
In the tradition of full disclosure$LABEL$1
Meh is right on for this Quizno's.  Mmmm... Toasty just doesn't cut it when the quality of meats and veg served on the bread is below par on most visits.  Prime rib sub that was a mass of gristle and fat.  A Lobster and Seafood sub that tasted like a Salt and Seafood sub.  Cucumbers that had seen much better days before they wound up on my sandwich.The saving grace.  When they have Clam Chowder as a soup choice$LABEL$2
I've been there for lunch a couple of times.  The food is ok pretty much typical of a chain$LABEL$2
I should have known better to go to Uno anywhere other than Chicago$LABEL$2
Uno Chicago Grill offers a terrific menu$LABEL$1
Let me start by saying that I don't like Uno's to begin with. My friend convinced me that I should give them another chance. While the food was better than I remembered$LABEL$3
The lunch special at the Pizzeria Uno is a good deal$LABEL$2
My co-workers and I stopped by here because downtown Charlotte looks like a ghost town at night and didn't find anything too compelling from fellow yelper's so we went stopped here since we were all familiar with it. Hate writing about larger franchise restaurants but wanted to let people know about our horrible experience. The wait staff seemed like we were a nuisance for patronizing their pizza shop and the attitude resonated for the duration of our meal. We sat outside where homeless people bummed for money and we saw a fight with plenty of profanity (felt bad for guests w/ kids) between a local and one of the bums who tried earlier to act like we bumped into him knocking his food on the sidewalk (expecting you would feel sorry for him and fork over some $$). When we ordered our waitress said \""I wouldn't get the soup right now\"" when one of us tried to order some which made us all question the safety/age of other menu items. The food took forever to get and the waitress kept asking if we wanted more beer every time she came by. The beer she recommended \""Red Oak\"" a local beer didn't please any of our pallets which made the wait even longer. 4 of 5 orders came out with something wrong so (big surprise) so we just sucked it up and got out of there ASAP. I apologize for the long review but this place was so bad I had to share my experienceDefinitely won't be back$LABEL$1
nice lobby. nice hotel. very slow internet. I realize it is free$LABEL$2
We booked here specifically because of the free shuttle$LABEL$2
Our overall experience here was very good. The front desk personnel were helpful in pointing us in the right direction to get started seeing what the city has to offer$LABEL$4
Finally! I've found a good smoothie place in the area! The smoothie I got here was awesome$LABEL$4
Noone is really friendly here$LABEL$3
While this bar is a consistent weekend visit for me & my friends$LABEL$4
****Note - This is a general review as I have been here numerous times and this review is not related to just one visit.****Dixie's Tavern is Steelers central on Sunday's during football season and that is why I enjoy this place$LABEL$4
This bar is big$LABEL$3
We went to Dixie's Tavern before the Bobcats Arena opened (i.e.$LABEL$2
Dixie's is always a mixed bag - never really know what's going to happen.  I guess I say that because I've been to Dixie's when it's a bit a slow and I've also been when it's extremely packed and busy.Overall I'd say it's a decent place to get drinks... also to meet people because it is a stand alone building that you can easily find without too much trouble.  I've had food here before and it's y our typical bar food - but good.  The wait staff have always been nice and the bartenders do what they can with the crowds.$LABEL$3
It reminded me of the dirty restroom at the gas station on HWY 40 driving through Texas. Dirty and nasty.$LABEL$1
I'm not huge into the bar scene$LABEL$3
I am not a huge fan of Dixie's but on occasion with a group of friends$LABEL$3
Our friends took us to this place out during a weekend visit to Charlotte.  Dixie's has a country-western bar feel to it but on the night we went they were playing Rhianna and other top 40 music.   The place was pretty packed and there were a lot of girls dancing$LABEL$3
This is the place for wanna be steelers fans. The bathrooms are terrible$LABEL$1
Not sure about this place. I have eaten here before and it was decent. However$LABEL$2
Just not my kind of place. There really wasn't anything in particular that stood out that was horrible. It lends itself to a younger crowd.  It never seems that clean. It has decent drink specials. During large events it will become incredibly packed.$LABEL$2
This rating and review is purely from a bar/nightlife perspective.This is a great place to go out to for the night on Friday and Saturday.  The crowd is young$LABEL$3
Beware! I checked my 2 receipts from one night I was there at the end of February 2013 and found I was overcharged on my credit card statement on BOTH receipts. I called Dixie's 3x over a 10 day period$LABEL$2
So you definitely have to go here with an open mind...because you're going to see some things unlike any other nightlife scene in Charlotte. But once you get into the 80's theme$LABEL$3
Granted I haven't been in since my \""experience\"" I really don't have a desire to go back.The night my friend and I decided to give it a whirl.. well$LABEL$1
Ah...the 80s.  Sweet dreams are made of this.  Granted$LABEL$4
I visited Charlotte and went to the Breakfast club with some locals. I was very impressed with the music$LABEL$3
Between '04 and '08 I lived on and off in Charlotte (long story).  Whenever I was putzing around the Queen city this was one of the few night spots I'd regularly hit.There are plenty of trendy bars or new places opening up$LABEL$4
What better way to celebrate a friend turning 30 this weekend than hit up The Breakfast Club right?! Well those were our thoughts exactly so on came the leg warmers and the tacky scrunchies and off we went to experience 1980 once again!The venue was obviously trying to cash in on the Speed Street crowds as it charged us a whopping $10 to park our cars ....and then another $7 (for girls- more for guys) to get in! I can completely understand charging for parking if we weren't entering their bar to spend money- but they obviously weren't out to please customers. So I walked in the door after spending $17 expecting at least maybe a break on the drinks -WRONG. This was definitely not the 80s as they accounted for inflation big time! This was more/as expensive than even some of the trendier clubs in Charlotte (and nothing can be said for quality by the way). I ordered a red bull and (well) vodka - $8!.... We excitedly exclaimed we were celebrating a special Bday night but the bartender did nothing to make it special or exciting and actually gave us really bad service! I have to say my breaking point was  when I attempted to get some water for myself and my friends to which I was rudely told they only had bottled water. I mean seriously?! How irresponsible is that to serve alcoholic drinks and then not have a glass of water available! Around 12:30 I wanted to close out my tab and literally waited (trust me I kept track) twenty minutes. I can understand if for whatever reason it is packed and there is only one bartender - but they had two bartenders and a bar back (who couldn't even bother to acknowledge my presence) and the place was fairly empty! I have worked in the service industry through college and trust  me when I say I can empathize in almost any situation but I had had enough. When the bartender went to another group who had just walked up to the bar instead - (thankfully they pointed out that I had been waiting long before them...even though I know he saw me) ...he was not a good bartender. The ONLY redeeming quality (hence the two-stars) was the music and the theme of the venue itself. Unfortunately that wasn't enough to save them in my eyes$LABEL$2
Awesome concept$LABEL$4
I had a ball here over the weekend! It was CIAA weekend so it was packed! They had a live gogo band playing (i believe it was backyard) and they played all my favorite songs! all of DC was in the building$LABEL$4
Best and worst bar in Charlotte$LABEL$3
I like going out but this place makes it hard to really want to come back.  Nothing in particular about the music or service or drinks.  It's just a worn out place.  I will say that the people watching in here is insane.  I do like the decor on the first floor$LABEL$2
Rude staff$LABEL$1
We live at Post Gateway$LABEL$3
As for the property its ok$LABEL$2
Do not go here if you want quick service.  I dropped my dry cleaning off on a Wednesday and was told it would be done by Friday.  When I went in on Friday morning he said it was not done yet and wouldn't be done until after 2pm.  Also very over priced.$LABEL$2
Very poor customer service. Have a special listed saying 10 items for 39.95 but if you have 11 items they charge you full price and you are not eligible for the cheaper rate. They also don't count your items and list the number on your claim check so if something is lost your out of luck. There are too many options in uptown. I will not try them again.$LABEL$1
Ruined a dress shirt that I took in with one small stain that I could live with$LABEL$1
I stopped by Tic Toc Diner for breakfast today and was very pleased. I ordered the Western omelet with toast and hash browns and I must say that it was fantastic. I love the outdoor seating that is right on the street which makes this place a great way to start off your day!!! The only downside is that this place can be a bit pricey just for breakfast but its worth it!!!$LABEL$4
Preferred Parking's rates are way too high.  We're parking in Charlotte$LABEL$1
Terrible parking company.  The rates are high considering the location of their lots.  In addition$LABEL$1
Want to let everyone know that$LABEL$1
When parking uptown$LABEL$2
This is$LABEL$1
Be aware.  Be very aware.  There are other options in uptown Charlotte.  I suggest you use the other options. Extremely unethical business practices.  They'll ticket you for not paying (paying on app or online you could be a few minutes behind)$LABEL$1
This place had everything a sammich lover needed. A straightforward$LABEL$5
Best sandwich in town...New Jersey all the way$LABEL$5
Food is good$LABEL$3
Disgusting$LABEL$2
Nice$LABEL$3
It's a convenience store$LABEL$2
Hello FriendsI come here often to pick up a few lil snacks during work hours. It is what it is$LABEL$3
The toenail in the carpeting and booger on the desk told me all I needed to know about the Omni.  I won't even go into the mildewy bathroom ceiling.  I can scarcely believe this is an Omni after staying at Pittsburg's Omni.  The lobby is beautiful$LABEL$1
Wireless connection at this place is HORRIBLE. NASCAR event was right outside our hotel so it was as loud as can be. However$LABEL$2
The goodGreat location$LABEL$3
My in-law stayed here while visiting/job interviewing a few days ago$LABEL$2
Let's be honest with each other on this review. Yes$LABEL$2
Substandard - not a good hotel for business$LABEL$2
This place was a bit worn$LABEL$3
The Uptown location was perfect for the purpose of our trip. We were in town for a football game. It is a nice walk from the Omni to the BOA Stadium. All of the staff that we dealt with were VERY friendly and helpful. Now for all the rest. 1. Parking nightmare. We arrived shortly after check-in time$LABEL$2
This Omni came highly recommended based on its location and the size of the suites.  As I was planning a bachelor party to include the Panthers game$LABEL$4
After multiple flat out miserable experiences at the Center City Hilton$LABEL$4
Decent hotel$LABEL$3
Wow...if you are familiar with the Omni in San Diego$LABEL$1
For the price this is a 2 star.  For location this place is a 4 star.  The rooms are small and they even gave me a corner room that said was bigger.  I would hate to see what a normal room looks like.  The corner room has 2 full size beds and is like a triangle.  You do have space but very little and the bathrooms well the toilet and the shower are like touching each other.  You can barely close the bathroom door if you want to do business in private!  The corner rooms also that face 4th street just expect a night of loud music as that side faces several rooftop bars and they play music loud late into the night.  Only saving grace is putting in the AC fan but that is loud as well.  Either music or white noise.  The signature lounge...again...small.  Overall the lobby is nice$LABEL$2
This Omni is in a superb location for a stay whe you want to sample some of the best of Uptown Charlotte.  Right in the hub of things on Trade St. in between Tryon and College$LABEL$3
Stayed here a few months ago and still remember the great service I received. One night$LABEL$5
Great location but not the best value.  Tiny bathrooms - could barely close the door with the rug.  Noisy guests had a party - we could hear the door slam as our beds were positioned on the wall of the hall.  Poor design.  Security finally broke the party up at 1:30 am.  Lots of other hotel choices in the area.$LABEL$2
I recently stayed at the Omni in Charlotte$LABEL$1
Hair in the sheets and stain on the pillow! Yuk!!!!! I don't think they changed the sheets. Maybe the previous guest made the bed$LABEL$1
Painfully Blah$LABEL$2
Solid hotel$LABEL$3
Location was excellent! Rooms were very basic. For the price I expected a lot more. The hotel is in need of an upgrade. I was here for a USF bowl game and this was the team hotel. The location was next to the EpiCenter which had plenty of entertainment and restaurant options.If I got a good deal$LABEL$3
As others have mentioned -- this hotel is extremely outdated. The location is perfect$LABEL$1
Looks fine$LABEL$1
Decent hotel downtown but has noise problem.Everything was more or less ok except for the noise.  Entertainment district across the way had throbbing disco beat that  wouldn't let us sleep.  .  Had to change rooms with my 3 kids at 02:30 a.m and we were flying back to Germany the next morning.Ask for room on side not facing entertainment district or simply book elsewhere.  Otherwise you will NOT get a good night's sleep.  It is simply inexcusable to book a nice downtown Hotel in a supposedly \""World\"" city and feel like you're trying to sleep directly on the disco dance floor.  This Hotel is in need of sound-proofing renovations.Extra note in case Omni reads this.  You should sue the pants off the entertainment district for the late night noise.$LABEL$2
GROSS! I can not believe my experience with this hotel. I started getting rooms downtown when friends from out of town come in. I was at the Westin 2 weeks prior$LABEL$1
An Omni hotel.  You know what you're getting.$LABEL$3
This hotel is located in the heart of Downtown Charlotte$LABEL$3
It's true that the bathrooms are teeny. It's true that the hotel feels a little dated. But I've stayed here twice and had pleasant experiences both times. The room was clean. The bed was comfortable. The staff was friendly. I would probably put it at 3.5 stars if possible. Given the brand$LABEL$3
I wish I would've read the Yelp reviews prior to booking this hotel$LABEL$1
This hotel is centrally located and there is plenty around to eat and do for those staying here while in town for work. They also were very accommodating when I required transportation in the early morning hours and arranged car service for me. However$LABEL$2
The hotel is in downtown Charlotte and is with an area of night clubs with loud outdoor music.  Was in town for Business and was not able to sleep for two nights due to loud banks in the area.The rooms and halls smell MUSTY and DAMP!!The menu for the restaurant/lounge needs some updating.  There is LIMITED items for those looking for a healthy diet.Will not be my choice for future stays in Charlotte.$LABEL$2
Stayed here thinking it would be a great place since I have stayed at Omnis before in several other locations. Made a reservation here and was also here for memorial day weekend and was very underwhelmed. The Omni hotels have always ben known to be a very nice place and this location was not up to that standard. It was not horrible but for the price some people pay I would expect better. When staying here I ordered room service several times and it was okay$LABEL$3
This was my first trip to Charlotte. I've looked up other hotels in the area and have decided upon the Omni. The Omni is very overrated. When we checked-in$LABEL$2
Stayed here because I was in town for a wedding. Hadn't stayed here in years. It could use some updating but the rooms are still nice and comfy. But$LABEL$4
The room was clean but very small. Looks like the rooms could use some updating. The staff was very courteous and accommodating. The workout area was extremely small and only has 4 cardio machines.$LABEL$3
Hotel is NICE but seems best suited for business people who will only be interested in spending LOTS of cash. Our room was 300 for 2 nights and the room had a mini fridge fit for only a few items$LABEL$3
Great window view and we received grade A customer service from the front desk to housekeeping. Had an issue with our air conditioning but maintenance was up within minutes to fix. I gave 3 stars because the room smelled of cigarette smoke and they are located around the dance clubs which you can hear from the room.$LABEL$3
Stayed 4 nights for business. Overall the hotel was ok. Front desk staff indicated our room was a \""suite\"" with two double beds$LABEL$3
Made a reservation in May through Expedia$LABEL$1
Ok hotel. Nothing special. Is located right across from the Epicenter so if you want quiet on the weekends$LABEL$3
We got a deal on priceline and stayed here for an event near Charlotte. To be fair$LABEL$3
We had our company holiday party here and it was an AMAZING time!  Great atmosphere and all of the catering staff were courteous and helpful.$LABEL$5
Reid's is a local grocery store$LABEL$3
There are several reasons to go to Sonoma:1.  We didn't have reservations$LABEL$4
Went here on a Tuesday night w/out reservations in an effort to try something new. Great wine list with both affordable and expensive options. The decor is cool and the atmosphere seemed lively. Great spot for work dinners or events. But the food was just not good$LABEL$2
Sonoma is one of those restaurants with a cool atmosphere$LABEL$3
I thought The Bookmark was a pretty cool bookstore to spend some time in while wandering around the uptown indoor shops. They've got a decent selection here$LABEL$3
I appreciate small$LABEL$1
Terrific lunch spot!  Their cubano sandwiches are excellent...and always go with the fries...skinny$LABEL$5
I definitely dig Latorre's. Prime positioning right off Tryon St$LABEL$3
The food is good$LABEL$5
AVOID THIS PLACE LIKE THEY SERVE SALMONELLA!!!Our dining experience at this restaurant was the worst I can remember!  We sat for over :15 minutes with no waiter and only after we went to the hostess did the waiter show up.I ordered what the waiter claimed was their \""signature\"" dish$LABEL$1
Salsa club moved next door$LABEL$4
My friends and I were looking for a Salsa place to dance.  Thanks for the Yelp friends telling me this place.  We went there first time tonight.I'm talking about the nightclub upstairs.  I do not like downtown whether day or night.  But for having fun with friends$LABEL$3
Tennis sale anyone?! Don's tennis has had a sale every time I've driven by. Located at the intersection of Morehead and McDowell$LABEL$4
Just went to Don's the other day to get my tennis racket re-strung.  The store was pretty busy (right after work - 5ish)$LABEL$5
I've bought shoes$LABEL$5
On my first day working in CLT$LABEL$2
This place is always packed at lunch so go early$LABEL$4
Dropped in for lunch with a friend while in Charlotte on business. Very loud$LABEL$3
This place is downright bizarre.  it's run by the same people who run Greek Isles$LABEL$2
Went here on a football Sunday and I was told that the menu was reduced to be quick and more American. This was a disappointment to me as I would not mind waiting for some good French cuisine. I ordered the only traditional plate left on the menu$LABEL$2
I wish I had an option for 2.75 stars because I do love this place but not sure it gets the 3 stars.....The specials are always 'just fine' such as beef tips and rice.  The gyro is fine$LABEL$3
Visited on Friday 3/25 for supper. I was really looking forward to a good Cajun meal. Out of fish on a Friday????  Are you kididng? And$LABEL$1
Not a bad little pub. Had the sliders$LABEL$3
Good place to go for a nice bite to eat.. Check the daily specials.... (lunch).... good food all around.(A bit pricey) for what its worth.A little tight if you plan to sit down during lunch. You will have to go outside to exhale. Service is promptCall in service is as expectedI onced ordered a buger$LABEL$3
Good daily specials for lunch and excellent portion for the price you pay. Service is also always spot on. If you work uptown$LABEL$3
I do miss working downtown since this is a nice spot to get some after work beverages (or 10).  Very laid back$LABEL$3
The staff rocks (and they tell me the food is good$LABEL$4
Went here on a weekday night. I didn't like it and I probably won't be back.$LABEL$2
Disappointing!! It is 9pm and we can't get a burger... Because they don't make them this late --- what? We left the Panther's game early! Oh well. We're here and it will be the last time.$LABEL$3
I enjoyed my dining experience here. The salt and pepper chicken wings were excellent! They brine them in vinegar and garlic for a few days$LABEL$3
The in-laws were in town this past weekend$LABEL$1
Very confused by this spot.  When I lived up town (2012)$LABEL$2
Came with with friends during lunch. Very busy with short wait times. Very loud too. Difficult to hold conversations. Seating too close together. Waitress was polite and very attentive. I had the Friday special- salad and cup of lobster soup. Very basic. Soup was mediocre. Definitely not homemade.$LABEL$2
I recently went here while on a business trip and had dinner here with the clients.  The menu was mostly seafood and they are trying to put a little bit of a nouveau twist to it.  Whatever that means.  The ambiance was nice... perfect for a romantic date$LABEL$3
Bleah!!!  I went here because I was staying at the Westin across the street.  We had about 12 people for dinner.  The decor was pretty nice but the food left alot to be desired.  I started by ordering a couple bottles of wine and one came incorreclty which was pretty bad considering I ordered it by number.  The waiter had all the personality of a rock.  Ok no biggie$LABEL$2
I've always enjoyed the food at Aquavina$LABEL$1
My bosses used to drag me here for business get-togethers and meetings.I know it's hard to imagine hating a place where someone else has picked up the tab. But consistently$LABEL$1
The lunch service is absolutely horrible.  I work in the building so my co-workers like to eat here.  Soda is always flat and service is very inconsistent.$LABEL$1
I really$LABEL$3
I used to love this restaurant and have brought out of town guest there for dinner in the past years but this restaurant has gone downhill and should no longer be in business.  My last visit was at lunch with other work colleagues a couple of weeks ago.  I ordered Seared Ahi Tuna Salad.  When it arrived$LABEL$1
My wife and I dined at Aquavina last night. It was good but not exceptional. She had the crab cake appetizer which was quite good. I had the wedge salad which was uninspired and the tuna entry which I liked a lot and which came with Forbidden Rice$LABEL$3
I was looking forward to my first visit to Aquavina but came away disappointed.   I'm quite easy to please food wise so this experience was a surprise to me.  This restaurant is relatively pricey so perhaps my expectations were high based on what I perceived would be value for my dollar.We dined on a surprisingly quiet Friday night. Even so$LABEL$2
I was so looking forward to my birthday dinner at Aquavina on Sept 29$LABEL$1
The food was good and I would probably be back if it was half the price(literally).  Although$LABEL$2
Recently had dinner$LABEL$1
Just have to say my room had a missing light bulb to help hide dinginest. Left in 3 minutes and booked room across the street at La Quinta.  Paid more but will sleep better. Wish I could have given Red Roof a quarter of a star.$LABEL$1
DON'T STAY HERE. room was not clean had coke bottle and spit cup with cig but ts in it and read of urine.  Crack head central. Canceled reservation and found another place.$LABEL$1
It's like they are trying to make the ghetto look classy. But$LABEL$1
This is a standard gas station and not really worth reviewing. I just wanted to say that if you can$LABEL$1
Until recently$LABEL$3
I generally only review food but they certainly earned me stepping outside the box.I spent all day yesterday at CMC Mercy for my step fathers knee replacement.  I couldn't have been more shocked from the experience.  I parked on the far right wing and was greeted within 60 seconds of exiting my vehicle.  I was actually headed down some stairs in the parking area and a gentleman a trash can offered me assistance.  His name was Larry and was extremely kind and pointed me in the right direction.The staff inside was equally as impressive.  They were very kind to my step father as well as my mother and I as we waited.  Prompt updates were made and the facility was extremely clean.  The DR visited late in the evening and I know he was there for a very long day.  He was very kind and wasn't in and out.  I'm just floored with the difference this was from hospitals I have been in the past.  I like to avoid the Dr. office at all cost$LABEL$4
Been going here for years for breakfast$LABEL$4
I am not sure how someone thinks this food is great.  It is subpar and out of the freezer.  There is no way that this is Southern fare that is good or even tasteful.  Nothing is homemade and food is dry.  Service is nice and the lobby is good.  But please close and stop serving food that comes out of the freezer.  Grocery stores are always open.$LABEL$1
Okay$LABEL$1
I only went in here to buy a gift.  Got in and out in 5min... the sales woman also helped me realized I could take advantage of a buy 2 get 1 free promotion so I didn't miss out.  Most B&BWs assault your senses the second you walk in.  Maybe it's just me being a guy$LABEL$3
Bellacino's overall has pretty good pizza & above average subs$LABEL$3
We stopped here to eat and spend some time before we had to check into our hotel room after a 3 hour drive. At first we were kinda wondering about the place because of a slightly funky smell in the air$LABEL$3
Location is good.  Surrounded by at least 6 hotels and an easy walk for guestsDecor is the same as any other chili's.  Fairly busy the night I stopped in$LABEL$3
Arrived and waited for 10 minutes before I grabbed a menu and asked an employee if the guests were supposed to seat themselves.. He responded \""You can\"" and walked by with out furthering assisting me.$LABEL$2
This place specializes in down home cooking.  They are famous for their fried chicken and I definitely recommend trying it.  They also have a variety of other foods to choose from if you're more health conscious that myself.  Definitely one to try for your next long lunch hour.$LABEL$3
I don't often get down to the Arboretum area$LABEL$3
From my one and only visit today so far$LABEL$1
Hit and miss for lunch and summer. Was told that veggies were all fresh$LABEL$2
Went to this place for breakfast for lunch with my sister. It was fast friendly service and they were quick to refill my sweet tea and awkward requests (I mix and match slides). My sister ordered pancakes which she had no problem with and returning to the South$LABEL$4
Pathetic$LABEL$1
We come to the Charlotte Cafe periodically primarily because they have a good variety of veggies on the menu.  The food is$LABEL$3
come here for breakfast once a week . Good$LABEL$3
Rough start for lunch. Waitress with an attitude.$LABEL$2
Had a good little breakfast for under $6.00. Simple decor friendly staff.$LABEL$3
Good Breakfast!  Not many Breakfast places in the Arboretum Area of CLT!$LABEL$3
I am a big fan of breakfast & brunch$LABEL$2
You wouldn't think there'd be much to say about a key shop$LABEL$5
I love that I've found a bookstore that isn't a chain. As much as Borders and Barnes are tried and true$LABEL$4
I'm a pretty big book reader & love trying out new book stores$LABEL$4
I love this little bookstore.  One of the few remaining independents in Charlotte.  Although the selection is limited (compared with Borders$LABEL$5
Great local bookstore in the Park Rd Shopping Plaza.   They have great side walk sales on sunny day$LABEL$4
NEVER USE THIS PLACE. DO NOT RECOMMEND. THEY DO NOT FOLLOW UP$LABEL$1
Last independent book store in town$LABEL$4
The Park Road Shopping Center has it all$LABEL$4
We purchased our wedding bands from the Park road location. The service was excellent helping us find exactly what we were looking for. When no wedding band matched exactly$LABEL$5
Great service.  Total transaction took about 15mins. Got $722 for five pcs of old jewelry. I almost fell out when Michelle told me the amount. Lol$LABEL$5
You better run from this place.  The owner must be a crook!  Our house was burglarized and the police found our very expensive watch for sale at this store.  My husband went with the detective to pick up the watch and the owner was rude and arrogant.  The police told us multiple times that this business is well known for buying stolen goods off the street and they continue to buy items from criminals although the police keep coming to their store and identifying stolen goods.  If you buy something from these guys you better make sure it has papers$LABEL$1
I got a tattoo of Africa on my chest here when I turned 18 to remind me of my many summers spent in Kingston$LABEL$2
I got a piercing here when I was 18 - after I had already pierced myself several times. I know$LABEL$2
The worst !  Brookdale Drive - Rocky River....Always trying to get you to do another eye exam.  Took in my son's new prescription in June to make sunglasses. They wanted to do another eye exam today. They said it had been 2 years since last eye exam.  I explained to them -  I brought in the new prescription in June and you used it on his sunglasses.  The lady kept arguing. My son walked out. I called and finally had to hang up. Also$LABEL$1
HORRIBLE customer service. I was called at 7:30 am to schedule a service call (having not spoke to the company before) telling me they would be there in 2 hours.We had a bad connection and got disconnected. When they called me back the gentleman said \""Get your damn phone fixed\"". Yes$LABEL$1
My wife and I are having a problem with our washing machine$LABEL$1
I'd give this company zero stars if it were an option. Carolina appliance was sent by out Best Buy Geek Squad protection plan to fix our brand new dryer when it started overheating and making a scratching noise. They came quickly - only three days from when we reported the problem. They said they needed to order a part and would be back within 7 business days to install it. When two weeks go by$LABEL$1
Wow- similar experience as other reviewers.  Purchased LgDishwasher from Best Buy. On the 2nd load every it refused to turn off. Called LG and they sent Carolina  Appliance. First go around - not too bad. After it was fixed - same thing. LG and BEst Buy promised a replacement but Carolina appliance had to sign off on it as a lemon . the owner was beyond rude!!!! Made many promises and failed to keep them. Claimed his repair guy  was out of cell range all day. He started taunting me -Serves you right for shopping at Best Buy he says. Maybe you should call the Geek Squad.Asked hubs to call - 30 seconds into the the call$LABEL$1
Very rude and unprofessional guy! Not willing to work out anything with the customer. Very short on the phone. I called for some appliance repair... Called back after almost a week and flat out said he was booked for over a week. He did not even offer to make an appointment after his busy time. Would not recommend this company to anyone.$LABEL$1
Kevin was excellent- diagnosed the problem quickly$LABEL$5
ZERO stars for this guy.  I called because we had a flood in our home$LABEL$1
I went here for cheaper gas without the drive all the way down to the South Carolina border. Then I had the thought hey might as well check out the store while I'm here!I actually appreciate people who buy in bulk$LABEL$2
False advertisement on gas prices:The gas price on the boards inside the store and in front of the store was different from the  price at the pump. After I pumped my gas$LABEL$1
I called this Sam's Club to order some sheet cakes on behalf of a friend who is a member and was going to be the one picking up the cakes. The \""ladies\"" in the bakery who answered the phone were extremely rude and unhelpful$LABEL$1
I am so sick of Walmart and Sam's Club associates. My visit today at Sam's Club was beyond aggravating. I understand you have to have a membership to shop and I was going to apply for one today but soon as I walked in the door which was about 3:00pm this lady or so call greeter was very disrespectful and didn't even give me a chance to go get me a membership card. She kept asking if I had a card and I said no I going to apply for one right now. I wanted to cuss her out so bad but I didn't. And the next time she does something like that again I will tell her about herself. Both Walmart and Sam's Club need to learn valuable customer service.$LABEL$1
Walmart on steroids... Customer service is a joke. I cancelled my Sam's membership because of the lack of customer service at this store! Sam's Club is fine as long as you don't ever have to interact with an employee.$LABEL$2
I was happy to find a good dry cleaner upon recently moving to the Charlotte area. I felt that they were a bit overpriced$LABEL$3
So here's how it goes...hubs and I have put off framing a sizable Thomas Kinkade print for a long time. Like three years long. We finally took this gorgeous print out of hiding and took it to Fastframe$LABEL$3
I love some BBQ$LABEL$2
I just had the bbq pulled pork sandwich because I'm trying to stop eating fried chicken.  I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich and it was pretty good. Actually it's better than Mac's Speed shop which now I find highly overrated.  The pork was moist$LABEL$3
I was in a time-crunch and starving and chose this Sonny's over some nearby chain restaurants. I'd been to a Sonny's a couple years back on a visit to Florida (when I was living in NY) and thought it was decent reasonably priced BBQ. Now that I live in NC and frequently travel to the BBQ capitols of the world (TX$LABEL$2
I had a rib lunch combo here with mac and cheese$LABEL$4
I'd heard good things about Sonny's$LABEL$4
Very good barbecue. Too bad it was pork instead of beef. Would recommend it though. Very friendly people$LABEL$4
The ratings on this place is pretty accurate$LABEL$3
This visit to Sonny's was the typical goodness I expect.  The sliced pork was juicy and delicious.  The kid loved the smoked turkey -- even got a second serving.  Super friendly service and sweet tea refills like crazy. Sure miss this place.$LABEL$4
Sonny's was a little disappointing.  Now$LABEL$2
I only eat here occasionally because a couple of my co-workers like it.  Bland bbq$LABEL$2
I hate to write a review like this in that I know the Owner's and his Dad. As a child I was able to meet them and grew up knowing Sonny.This location was kind of busy. Went in the door and waited for a while before one of the 20 people who worked there stopped goofing around and actually acknowledged the two groups and me and my son who had come in. Clearly this should have been an indicator of what was next.We were seated in a dirty booth and the family next to us looked very unhappy. It took about 15 minutes for anyone to come to the table. She took our drink order and left. In the mean time she delivered cold food to the family next to us that looked unhappy.about 10 more minutes and the people behind us who had come in with us finally met their server who was more than confused. We still had not gotten any drinks and not placed an order. The waitress came back to the table and asked about our drink order again. I gave her five minutes. When she came back and had nothing I gave up. I grabbed the manager on the way out and he looked like a deer in the headlights. He knew he had issues$LABEL$2
I have a confession to make and it won't be pretty... Ok$LABEL$5
I visited around lunch time and the food was not that good. I was expecting it to be a lot tastier. The entree was a  dry. I's a good thing I had sauce. I am sorry$LABEL$2
Drive thru issues and rude manager. My order was wrong and there was no cars in the parking lot.  So Im not sure what their issue was today. When I made the complaint and asked to speak to the manager. She didn't care what I thought and dismissed me completely. She even rolled her eyes at me.I have been a customer here since the 1980s and have never been treated like this.  The food was as good as it always is. I recommend you avoid the tyvola location..$LABEL$2
Came with the family of 5 for lunch on Sunday. All of the food was good. I had the dry rub ribs and was probably the one item I would less likely try again. The ribs were cooked to perfection but the rub lacked flavor. I had the homemade beans and  Mac and cheese$LABEL$4
The restaurant was clean and well maintained. Our waitress was outstanding. The food was sub-par. Ribs were over done and dried out.  Corn was over cooked and soggy.  Green beans were a mess as was the corn bread.   This is not a good example of real southern barbecue.  New York maybe$LABEL$3
I ordered the Sonny's Sampler$LABEL$5
Very good and consistent barbecue! I've had the dry rub ribs why were meaty and flavorful. I've also had the smoked turkey and brisket sandwiches which were both great- authentic$LABEL$4
Better than expected. Many salad bar items$LABEL$4
Can't say enough good things about my experience here. Plenty to choose from on the menu. Great helpful staff$LABEL$4
This is my go to place when in Charlotte I have been going here for years and they have only gotten better as times goes by. I always have the sampler plate and everything on it is top notch. Another thing I like about it is consistently great service and fair prices for 20 bucks I can get a great dinner and service. Keep up the good work sonny's$LABEL$4
im a carolina bbq fan.  and sorry..but this bbq is just no that good.  its fast food bbq.  why not do real bbq sonny?  i dont want mcribs from a carolina bbq place$LABEL$1
How dies this place have 3$LABEL$1
I almost got sick on all of the chocolate coffee beans in this place$LABEL$3
I wrote a book at Coffeeworks$LABEL$4
We popped into CoffeeWorks on a dreary$LABEL$4
Really good coffee--get it in a mug to drink there. Small enough to listen to other people's conversations$LABEL$3
Was leaving the Wachovia parking lot in U-City$LABEL$4
Michelins. Their service writers are competent and courteous. Free rotations.$LABEL$4
I've been taking my vehicles here since 2008. No complaints. Love the shuttle service. Free coffee$LABEL$4
OK so it is a little on the ghetto-tastic side$LABEL$4
The Park Terrace theaters are no fancy theaters by any means.  In fact$LABEL$4
Love that this theater plays more than your average blockbuster.  Its my usual weekend matinee spot to see the newest random movie out.  I'm a sucker for indie films and besides the Manor this is the only place to see them.  Nice staff$LABEL$4
I hate paying full price for movies. There's just something wrong with $12 for two hours of people talking into their cell phones$LABEL$3
Charlotte needs more theatres with limited release movies.  Right now there is the Manor Twin$LABEL$4
This is not the fanciest theater in the city. In fact$LABEL$3
went here to see a movie after having lunch near buy. although appeared clean$LABEL$3
I only go here if I have no other choice. This place is filthy and outdated. The bathrooms are yuck and this whole place should be redone! Nasty!$LABEL$1
I will admit it is no Six Flags or Universal Studios$LABEL$4
Maybe I'm spoiled$LABEL$2
Some of the rides here are quite carnival-ish. However$LABEL$2
Basically a watered-down version of California's Great America. Thank god for that 2 for 1 burger king cup compliments of my older bro.Ride review in the order I rode:1) Nighthawk:  I remember riding this thing at G.A. (Stealth)$LABEL$3
I haven't been to Carowinds in years.  We went once as a family day trip and a few times in school.  My favorite part was the guess your mph pitch game.  We couldn't care less if we won a prize (we never did) we just wanted to see how fast we could throw.  I guess around twelve yrs old we threw in the forty mph range.  AND WE FELT LIKE GODS.  Right next door was the ice cream sundae stand where you could get your dessert in a mini baseball batting hemet.  I still have all those helmets.  O there were the rides.  Back then the Carolina Cyclone was the new coaster with a loop and two corkscrews.  White lightening was a simple one loop and up a hill and then again backwards.  I always liked the swings.  Maybe because it was beside the ice cream sundae stand.  They had Rip Roaring Rapids which was a little float going down a little river with water splashing everywhere.  And for some reason we waited 2 hours to ride this each time.  Im sure none of these rides exist anymore but back in the day it was great.  Me and chickie ended up living a couple of miles from Carowinds a few years ago but had no desire to visit.$LABEL$5
Nice park. Good selection of coasters. Plenty of shade and fans. The map was hard to navigate though. A couple rides went down during the day. 3g was tricky to pick up in the park. All in all... A pretty good day. I prefer kings island or cedar point$LABEL$4
Carowinds straddles the border of North and South Carolina and is an all-day drive from the DC area$LABEL$4
Before I begin$LABEL$3
This review is mostly of the water park...We were there yesterday nice and early!! By the end of the day this place turned crazy!! Sooo many people were there!! We got there by 10 or earlier and walked around in the kids area so my nephews could go on some rides before we headed over to the water park. At this point it was still pretty quite and nice!! We went over to the water park area a little before 11 to wait to get in$LABEL$4
This definitely isn't one of my favorite amusement parks.  I'm not a fan of the layout of the park$LABEL$2
I guess you can call me a big kid$LABEL$4
this is one of the better theme parks.  it has some really great rides and is very family friendly.  it has the southern charm from all of its employees.  it is a fun place to stop and play for a few hour.  you can do almost everything in the park in half a day so it makes it nice if you have pass to go and just spend a few hours.  if you like theme parks this is one you need to go to.$LABEL$5
What a fun time at scarowinds!  You can tell they put a lot of effort into it and nothing beats being at a park at night. Only problem I had was only you couldn't find anyone selling hot chocolate and no one knew where you could. 45 degrees outside and no hot drinks for sale?  Need some work on that$LABEL$4
OMG!! Had A Blast! Scarowind is soo fun (However I don't get scare$LABEL$5
I grew up in the Columbia area and spent a fair amount of time enjoying Carowinds and everything that it had to offer.  Mind you that this was well before the time of the water park and when the \""White Lightning\"" graced the white hot pavement.  This being said$LABEL$4
I've long been a fan of amusement parks and grew up spending hot summer days at Six Flags$LABEL$3
Great park for family fun. They even host music festivals there which is fantastic. Something for everyone for sure!$LABEL$4
My Daughter took me to Carowinds for Fathers Day$LABEL$3
I've been to quite a few amusement parks...and this was by far the worst.I purchased my tickets$LABEL$2
Don't buy your tickets online! In fact$LABEL$1
Saw this place from the highway quite a few times and figured that it's location in Charlotte would mean that it is Busch League.  I was pleasantly surprised that it is actually a pretty legit theme park.It is owned by Cedar Fair$LABEL$4
Carowinds made the me I thought I left back in my coaster freak days very$LABEL$4
In comparison to other theme parks around the world$LABEL$3
Awesome rides!!!!! Both children and adults rides were terrific! We went on a Friday and there were no lines! What more can you ask for?$LABEL$5
As a former employee of Cedar Point (one of the sister parks in the CedarFair Company)$LABEL$2
We went for Mother's Day Weekend and had a blast. Were surprised how much better this park is than Six Flags. You must ride the Intimidator$LABEL$4
We participated in the music festival yesterday$LABEL$2
Carowinds in my opinion is crap. Poor customer service in all parts of the park. Managers of the park know this and they dont do a thing about it. Six flags a few hours away is so much better. Carowinds for that they offer is not worth the drive or the money. The food is very pricey and its not that great.$LABEL$2
Carowinds is a fun place.....where else can you spend $4 on a bottle of water?!$LABEL$3
I've been coming to Carowinds for 18 years. I also worked there for 2 years. It's my baby$LABEL$5
We went during an extremely hot Saturday in August so I would not recommend going at that time but that is the only time we could do it so we made the best of it. It was incredibly crowded and they warn you on the website not to go on Saturdays but again we had no choice and wanted to take our two kids 13 and 15 year olds to do the coasters. I have some tips that we found that will hopefully make your trip more enjoyable. They do offer fast passes but they were $40 extra on that day(different prices at different days) so x4 that was not happening for us. one thing we found out that if you ask for a large cup of ice water (instead of the tiny tiny ones they first offer you) they will give you the larger ice water cups for free! Otherwise$LABEL$3
I thought Carowinds would be a good way to spend an evening.  I hadn't been to an amusement park in quite a few years and apparently in those few years$LABEL$3
You might enjoy it$LABEL$2
Intimidator and Cobra$LABEL$4
Ok park. Some good coasters. Intimidator and nighthawk are our favorites.  A lot to do for the kids. Should have wait times listed for rides. Waited 1 hr 35 min for nighthawk. Need to improve carowinds app. Staff isn't polite or even nice for that matter. Park isn't very clean. Bathrooms are filthy and smell awful.$LABEL$2
This is the 4th cedar-faire operated theme park I've been to and most definitely the worst. Here's why:- half of the rides weren't open because 'the wind'... Yeah$LABEL$2
just spent the day with my husband$LABEL$1
Because my visit was before Labor Day the water park was closed and the park was not particularly crowded. I do think the rides should have wait times posted$LABEL$4
As a kid I remeber fallong down an open unmarked manhole$LABEL$1
If you want a one-liner$LABEL$3
DO NOT BUY THE MEAL DEAL AT THE PARK OR ONLINE. I REPEAT DO NOT BUY THE MEAL DEAL.  At 30 bucks a person YOU think it will save on eating costs. ..NOPE you get 5 places to eat at and YOU do not get to choose what you eat the employee failed to mention this. NO healthy coices from the 4 things you can eat and DRINKS not included. Carowinds made 20 bucks off us cause after 2 meals each of crap pizza and nasty \""chicken\"" fingers we gave up. DO NOT FALL FOR IT. Otherwise it is an amusement park full of wild children and crazy pushing people. Not like I remembered as a kid. Prepare to see a chiropractor cause rides are old or whiplash causing. The intimadator bout killed me whoa. Employees were nice cept for meal deal scam lack of information kid. And the park restrooms  WERE A NIGHTMARE. So nasty. Save your money go to Dollywood way nicer crowd and their meal deals have real food  choices. Thanks Carowinds but never NEVER again.$LABEL$3
If you are planning to go more than three times$LABEL$4
I like Carowinds$LABEL$3
If your coming here BUY THE TICKETS ONLINE$LABEL$3
My wife and I showed up the other weekend and got stuck on one of your rides that you lay down on. We we're stuck laying down tilted back on this roller coaster for about 20 minutes. Everyone on the ride was flipping out because we were all getting head rush. When we finally got off after your employees gave zero communication. We were told that if we would of shut up and listened we would of known that there were technical difficulties. Seriously who says that?The medics there did nothing but give us a cup of water. After sitting my wife down for an hour to rest she actually became sick and was on the verge of passing out and all you guys could do was give her a free drink. Over 100$ worth of money spent to only have been there for a little over an hour. It was a waste of my day time and money. It was my wife's birthday and instead of being able to enjoy the day we had to leave because of the issues from the ride malfunctioning. A day looking forward to having some fun turns into a damn headache. It's sad when a park can only give you a drink for compensation.$LABEL$1
My wife and I bought tickets online in advance to the park. We came on Halloween night for Scarowinds. Well we were here for 30 minutes before rain and lightning came. We went to guest services and they told us there are no refunds. If you plan on going to this park make sure to check the weather or kiss your $$ goodbye.$LABEL$1
It is about in between a Six Flags and a Disney park on a scale of how nice it is. Nice selection of coasters$LABEL$4
If you already know what you need and are OK paying more for it here than any other place...  proceed.   They want to sell you anything regardless.I asked to have one tire patched.   The manager was unable to give me any estimate for over 20 minutes until my car was on the rack and the wheel was off the car.   I asked three times how much patches cost.  He reluctantly said they average $30 eventually.   So mine will be less?   \""Well$LABEL$1
Worst customer service ever. The manager is rude and talks bad about the client and little care for his customer$LABEL$1
The new service manager Kenny was extremely polite and helpful in explaining options for my wife's vehicle. I've been coming to this location for over a decade and have always been pleased with the services received.$LABEL$5
Worst place ever. Don't go there. Customer service was awful and they didn't even do what I asked them to$LABEL$1
Great place to work - a company that cares about its people. While most work is fast paced$LABEL$5
In my opinion$LABEL$1
I do not recommend going here. I was searching for an independent little place to pick up dog food. The name almost turned me off$LABEL$2
It's a flea market.  Nothing more; nothing less.  It's old crap that no one should need unless you are a hoarder.  There are plenty of free flea markets and yard sales that are free.  This misadventure cost me $20 in admission fees.  What a waste.  It's $10 a head.  Finally$LABEL$1
A great place to spend a weekend and the staff is super friendly. Did not find many super deals as many things were priced high but we enjoyed looking around$LABEL$3
The dealers are so knowledgeable and helpful! We always find some great stuff. We just recently purchased vintage blue glass BALL jars from the 1950's for a DIY project.$LABEL$5
The expo itself is pretty lame - it seems like a few buildings in a field$LABEL$2
Here for Carolina RebellionPros- plenty of bathrooms$LABEL$3
It is what it is...an open field with some storage-type buildings$LABEL$3
Just had a booth at the Quilt Show this past weekend.  The service of the volunteers was excellent$LABEL$4
Friends dragged me here for the gun show.Parking is on a large grassy area with little organization and no direction from attendants. You're just hunting for a spot all on your own. Make sure you park \""legally\"" and that you leave enough room in case someone doesn't know what they are doing any manage to block you in.Long queue for paying the entrance charge - note that there are multiple ticket windows and you may be able to move from a long line to a shorter one where the lines break up.The gun show took place across three structures with an open area in the middle for the smokers. Not recommended if you're at all claustrophobic and don't handle crowds well. Why the fire marshal allowed this sort of tightly packed humanity I don't know. If there were a panic$LABEL$3
It was just a great idea my wife had to go with the kids to the fair they had going on there; a great idea it was. Anything that puts a smile on my girls face is good for me. No one was there directing traffic for parking so it was pretty much grab what you can; parking closer to the ticket booth would be smart because it's a long walk from the back. 4 and under was free and adults were $8 and children $5. Didn't realize you had to pay extra to get on the rides nice trick$LABEL$3
Pretty much have only visited this place during the antique and flea market weekends so I can't say as to how they handle actual specific events other than this one.  The parking is in a gravel lot/field but they don't charge to park so that is a plus.  Admission the day I went is $5 for the entire day.  The vendors change around so there's always something new to browse as well.Thankfully and most importantly there is a small bar between a few of the metal buildings that actually serves beer and mixed drinks.  That's a nice break to have given the size and how long it actually takes to take in all the different buildings and weather permitting the outdoor areas.$LABEL$3
Dr. Caroline Pierce is my primary physician at Mecklenburg Medical Group$LABEL$4
Dr. Wanda Robinson is one of my favorite people in the world:-) Never had a doctor that genuinely cares for her patients and is not afraid show it. I know she gets sick of me(proclaiming to be a dr in my own mind) self diagnosing myself by way of the internet.......please forgive me:-) The office is conveniently located uptown in the BB&T center and I've never had a problem getting in for a last minute appointment or if there is an emergency.$LABEL$5
I have been going to this practice for yours.  Really liked my primary a lot.  That said$LABEL$1
Came in to visit Dr. Anne Barnard and was greated by some of the friendliest people.  I get pretty anxious about any doctor visit so anyone willing to share a smile is a plus for me.  I was most impressed at how close to my appointment time it was to when I actually got taken back to my doctors exam room.  That's a rarity these days I think we can all agree on.The place was clean$LABEL$3
The doctor prescribed me medication that I am allergic to. It was in my chart and I told her about my allergy in person. I ended up in the emergency room. The practice manager does not seem to care about the issue and their whole staff is awful.$LABEL$1
Good for the most part.  Umar Bowers is a nice guy$LABEL$4
Not a real big fan of Old Navy since I guess I grew out of that phase... don't get me wrong they make respectable clothes but there are only so many ringer t-shirts one can wear in a lifetime.I recommend the clearance rack strategically located in the back of the store sections.  I guess it's pretty smart to put the regular priced stuff in front$LABEL$2
This Old Navy usually has a decent selection sizes and clearance items. Many of the sales staff are helpful and the managers always seem committed but dang the register person last time I was there even made ME disinterested in the fact that I was getting a new garment. This store seems oddly large for the amount of clothing they have to fill it$LABEL$3
I loathe these stores. The clothes are cheaply made. The prices aren't comaprable to the item. This is \""name brand\"" prices for crap clothing. The only reason I set foot in here is because my daughter got gift cards from relatives for Christmas. and for $50 she got a thin pair of jeans$LABEL$1
Why are people hating on the Old Navy? Especially Debbie Downer down there. Not everyone can afford name brand hoity toity clothes like yourself AND for your kid? Ok moneybags. ANYWAY- I like this place. They carry a TON of sizes (not everyone is a size 2)$LABEL$4
The selection seem to be the same as the store in Concord Mills and the one in the Charlotte Premium Outlet. As well$LABEL$3
I have been a member of GWV Y since it originally opened.  The staff is amazing$LABEL$5
I love the Gateway Village Y.  The staff are very friendly and do a great job keeping the facility clean.  Unlike some of the other Y's in the area$LABEL$5
There are many good and not-so-good things about the Dowd. Let me break it down:Pros: - Excellent modern facility. All the equipment is fairly new and works well. - Fitlinx is a really cool free program you can use to keep track of your weight-lifting routine and your other exercise. - Two good-sized pools (one warm$LABEL$3
This is hands down the best gym in Charlotte (sans the parking lot$LABEL$4
Dowd wooed me with its beautiful facilities$LABEL$4
Lets see$LABEL$2
Been meaning to write an update for the Dowd for the longest time$LABEL$5
We got a membership at the Y after they started offering their pricing based on income...and our membership at another local gym expired (finally).  I've been trying to get used to the flux of people...after the 1st of the year it went WAY up- the afternoons are so crowded parking is usually a big pain and the classes are completely packed.  I have started going in the mornings and weekends to avoid the masses of people....although that should slowly dwindle as the 'new years resolutions' die down.Overall I like the facility- new/updated equipment and a large selection of classes$LABEL$4
The Dowd has great facilities$LABEL$3
I have been a member of the Y for a while$LABEL$3
I love the dowd y . Love that it is so close to my office  making it easy to fit into my day. My favorite class is the roc it circuit training class. My goal is to do 3 supersprint triathalons. Just started the master swim  and I am learning lots. Great support for whatever you do.  Only down side parking if you go between 5-6  although I just received email  that they now have extra parking at surrounding office and church. I like checking in with Bryan on second floor if I don't see him in a while he notices and it keeps me accountable.  Great people working there keep me feeling like I belong  and supported in what ever my goal.$LABEL$4
5 stars come from my overall experience with gyms in the past and I personally love Dowd Y.  I just realize I haven't written about it.  Look$LABEL$5
I used to work out at Dowd way back when I had more time.  At that time$LABEL$4
I visited the Dowd YMCA for the first time last night for a workout and a session in their steam room. Normally I'm a regular at the south Charlotte Y's (Morrison$LABEL$3
Great facility! Amazing staff! Dion assisted me and he was so professional! I will be joining this gym! So much to do there! I simply loved racket ball!$LABEL$5
Still favorite Y in area.  Convenient location$LABEL$5
Would not recommend$LABEL$2
Again$LABEL$4
The Childress Klein (or Uptown) Y is the best place to get in a great workout during the day if you work in that area. There are plenty of cardio and weight machines$LABEL$4
If you are a stickler like I am for a treadmill with a tv then you wont like this YMCA.  The treadmills face the tvs which are mounted on the wall and they also face the basketball courts which is kind of interesting sometimes hehe ;-)   They have to work out a different arrangement for the towels - other YMCA's have the towels on a shelf and then you throw the used ones in a bin.  This location keeps the clean towels in a bin.  People going by not used to this will just throw their used towel in without looking and 'pollute' the clean ones.  Geez just make this consistent with your other locations YMCA so people dont do this!But if you are in a time crunch and you work uptown you can get used to this tiny location.  Don't forget parking is free after 4:30PM!!!$LABEL$3
After hearing good things about Blue Restaurant and Bar$LABEL$2
Blue features mediterranean style food and offers some unique options that I've not had before. The menu is pricey. Beautiful decor with a nice bar and jazz band playing. The dining room is very nice and feels like it should be pricey.We've had great service every time we've been. The wait staff is helpful$LABEL$4
I'd heard great things about Blue$LABEL$2
Disclaimers:1) I'm not from Charlotte and live in San Francisco2) I was in town on business (and so not paying)Group of 6 close business associates at Blue for dinner. Drinks: Had a guy who grew up in Napa picking wines so we had a few very wonderful bottles. He was impressed with the restaurant's selection and we were with his. I also had a microbrew amber ale on draft that was wonderful.Service: Was not over or underdone. Had the flair and attention of a nice establishment without being too snobby/formal. One bottle of wine we particularly liked ran out so the manager came over to talk about similar choices. Nice touch.Appetizers: Choosing cheese and then pairing them with membrio$LABEL$3
After passing by Blue several times during walks Uptown and saying$LABEL$3
Good but too pricey for what you get.$LABEL$3
The atmosphere and the service made my evening with friends so much more pleasant that I will definitely be back. The food was good$LABEL$5
Pricey and just mediocre in service$LABEL$2
Dining out is like dating. You can go out once and have no desire to ever go out again. Or you can fall in love and find reason to be back daily. Although I found the menu to offer a nice variety$LABEL$2
Very curteous service but could not make up for a compltely lackluster dinner. Ordered the rib eye special with herbed gnocci and broccoli rabe. Steak was bland$LABEL$1
I loved this place the first time$LABEL$2
it was ok.  mussels were good.  service ok.  ambiance seemed dated.  worth a trip$LABEL$2
This Mickey Mouse operation has been relentlessly spamming me for months.  I AM IN BOSTON$LABEL$1
If I were opening a restaurant$LABEL$4
Thumbs up$LABEL$4
I like Blue$LABEL$5
My boyfriend and I have eaten here a few times$LABEL$4
Great setting. Big restaurant but great service. Mediterranean. Halibut was killer - in a soup.  Major dipping action.  A gem!$LABEL$5
So I just rushed home from Blue because I couldn't wait to get on here and give them this review.  Ok$LABEL$1
Blue.  Your Friday night just got a lot more exciting! The restaurant was busy$LABEL$4
Invited another couple to join us for dinner and a play on a Friday night. The owner took us to our table and was clairvoyant as he asked if we were on our way to the play.  When we responded yes$LABEL$4
If someone rates this less than a 4 then they probably should not be grading a fine dining restaurant.  Blue has an excellent atmosphere that is light and whimsical.  It is formal but not what I would call over the the top.  Do dress nice though!Staff is obviously experienced and they know how to describe a meal properly.  They are also very friendly and make you feel at home.  The variety of food was the ONLY thing keeping me from rating a 5.  Granted$LABEL$4
Great place and great atmosphere! I ordered the wild boar dish and it was amazing. So fresh and not gamey at all. I am an avid hunter so I was interested to see their take on this dish. I was very delightfully surprised. I had a great experience there and can not wait for my next excuse to go back. Make sure you call ahead because it gets very busy and it is worth it! They have great live music and the service was great.$LABEL$4
I went here for my birthday and it was a very lovely dinner. There was a jazz band playing which gave the place a good atmosphere. It's classy and a perfect celebration or romantic dinner spot. It is pricey though so plan to spend a pretty penny. My husband and I shared the Flatbread and the Scallops and for dinner i had the Beef Tenderloin and he got the Duo of Wild Boar. The food was fabulous! Juicy and very flavorful. Every dish was presented beautifully and tasted as good as it looked. I was very happy and reallllly full by the end of the night. If you have the money or a special occasion to celebrate do it at Blue$LABEL$4
I've been to Blue twice to entertain clients for dinner and both times$LABEL$5
We went here for New Year Eve. This was our second time at Blue and it was just as good as the first time. Impeccable service. Energetic and Chic Ambiance. The Lemon Drop Martini was so good that I had two and I have been known to send it back to the bar if it is not made right.My Butternut Squash was rich$LABEL$4
Restaurant Week is a double-edged sword.  Restaurants either go all out$LABEL$4
This was a surprisingly great find - the menu had plent of options$LABEL$4
Food was really good! The tenderloin ala Blue was so good with their risotto. DO NOT Valet your car though. Took us 45 min to get it back.$LABEL$3
I contacted the restaurant to inquire about the Jazz.  I was it was available from 7pm-10pm.  However$LABEL$3
We were excited to dine at Blue as part of Restaurant Week.  The restaurant is visually stunning$LABEL$2
The food was literally inedible. We had calimari as our app & it was very yummy. We were excited about our entrees based on this course. My husband ordered the shrimp gnocchi dish. It tasted like orange peels-even the shrimp. There was a pesto sauce & orange rinds in the dish$LABEL$1
Had dinner at the bar and thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Colleen the bartender advised me on the meal and Mike the bartender talked soccer and hoops.  First they served me home baked bread with a delicious spread that was a meal by itself$LABEL$5
My wife and I went here in September to celebrate my birthday$LABEL$4
My wife and I came for an appetizer after a show around 9:30 pm. The ambience with the live music is nice. We sat in the bar area and ordered a pepperoni pizza and arrancini as appetizers. Food was decent but service was pretty shoddy. The small plates they gave us with the silverware literally had crumbs from another meal on it. Hadn't been touched. Smh.$LABEL$3
We decided to check out Blue during the Dine Out Charlotte weekend since the menu looked pretty darn appetizing. We dressed for a night out on the town$LABEL$4
i have been to blue about 4 times$LABEL$5
This might be my new favorite date spot in charlotte. We went on a Wednesday night and as expected$LABEL$5
Went there while visiting Charlotte.  Found the place cold$LABEL$2
I was rather disappointed with Blue. Excited for my last and final meal of restaurant week in Charlotte I couldn't wait to get in and order. The waiter$LABEL$3
I came here for dinner when we were out of town for my girlfriends bachelorette party and it was delicious. We had several bottles of wine and champagne and each tried to order something different on the menu for everyone to try. I ordered filet with risotto which was heavenly. I also was able to try the duck which was equally delicious. I will say we were all wearing dresses preparing to go out for the night but I did feel a bit out of place$LABEL$4
I didnt see anything spectacular about this place.   All I kept hearing about this place is the food$LABEL$2
I usually do not take the time to review restaurants$LABEL$2
We went to Blue for restaurant week and expected great things. We love downtown and this is one of the only restaurants we haven't visited. First I want to say that customer service was fantastic. We had a great waiter who took his time and never rushed us. He gave us wonderful ideas and we would visit again for this alone. However; we were disappointed in the meal itself. For the price you pay we were expecting some bold flavors. I got the chicken expecting it to be seasoned wonderfully. I didn't finish my meal because it was bland. Presentation was beautiful$LABEL$3
A friend of mine from my hometown in Michigan found out I moved to Charlotte for a bit and told me I must check out Blue- so after a month and a half here$LABEL$4
At the LAST min on a Saturday night 6 of us needed a table for dining downtown. Through Open table we were able to get a reservation in 15 min to blue. The table all started off with a beverage my husband and I shared a bottle of meiomi pinot noir which was so good ( one of our friends suggested it). We also had crab cakes$LABEL$4
Delicious dinner of scallops and trout. The appetizer of calamari was fabulous and the service at the bar with Tommi as our server was perfect. Awaiting music.$LABEL$5
Came here about 4:30pm looking for a happy hour and some appetizers at the bar. There were people at the bar so of course we sat down at the bar.   Someone could have told us when we first walked in they were not serving food yet.  So we left and then came back because of all the great reviews.  Sat at the bar again and shared some appetizers.  All 3 over prices and all 3 just okay.   Living close to MD i guess it as a mistake on my part to think the crab cake would be anything medicore but saw it was crab and lobster so we gave it shot.   And still disappointed.  This is what we had-Provence style lobster and crab cakes finished with basil oil and a citrus beurre blanc. Provence style lobster and crab cakes finished with basil oil and a citrus beurre blanc. and their were 2 the size of quarters.   Pop and they were down the hatch!   And they were 13.00!  1 star.Next Arrancini-Risotto balls stuffed with pancetta$LABEL$2
My first time here was for the Queen's Feast a few weeks back. We try to go somewhere new every time this event rolls around to see if we find any little unexpected gems. Food was pretty good$LABEL$3
We stopped here to share three appetizers after sharing three appetizers at BlackFinn.  What a mistake!  The lobster crab cakes were one bite$LABEL$2
I'm not terribly impressed with Blue. Here's why:Service is generally good$LABEL$3
I am sorry to be writing this review.  My first visit to Blue a few years ago was fabulous.  The service was very good!  But$LABEL$1
Mother's Dy Brunch- 3 adults and 1 child - 180.00 - only drinks were 2 waters and 2 teas-  gratuity was included in bill - so service was barely passable.  Food was okay - but not worth the price charged.  However - the crepes were awesome - the saving grace.  The entertainment was good and the atmosphere fine.  Probably would NOT go back.  Don't see a good value.  Do not recommend.$LABEL$2
My wife and I always enjoy our meals at Blue. We had one of her birthday dinners$LABEL$4
Came here with the boyfriend and his parents who had a gift certificate for dinner on a Saturday night. There was a high school jazz band raising money for a cancer patient$LABEL$2
Went for a girls night for restaurant week. I was feeling crazy so let the waiter pick my meal from the options. He was blah.. All the staff seemed overworked and very tired. The jazz band was the only thing buzzing. He picked the risotto balls they were okay$LABEL$2
We decided on Blue Restaurant for Charlotte Restaurant week as I had heard from several friends and colleagues how excellent the food was.  I have to say$LABEL$2
I wish I'd read the recent reviews before venturing here on a Saturday evening. I should've known something was up when we were one of only four parties in the restaurant on a Saturday evening at 7:00 p.m.After being seated$LABEL$2
Came here for my friend Melanie's 50th birthday$LABEL$3
I had a really great shopping experience at Nitsa's and TOTALLY recommend it for brides or mother's of the bride. They've got a great selection when you first walk in for mother's of the bride$LABEL$4
Naomi is amazing!!! She is so patient and she can take a simple dress and accessorize to turn it  into a one of a kind creation. This is the only place in Charlotte I would recommend to get the gown of your dreams because I trust Naomi to help thru the process and not just trying to make a quick sale.$LABEL$5
Disappointed doesn't begin to explain. I now spent $350 on a bridesmaid dress that will never be worn. It is the wrong size$LABEL$1
Totally disappointed in the service at this bridal boutique! Nobody would help us and they were eating in the back. Very snobby would NEVER recommend this boutique to any bride! The store was empty and they acted like they had no time for us!$LABEL$1
They have a tough time here with the lunch rush.  You HAVE to go at off hours$LABEL$2
White tuna sushi was great! But the Pad Thai just ok.  Next time i'll stick to the sushi$LABEL$3
Decent Asian lunch fare in Uptown. All the reviews saying don't go during peak lunch hours are spot on. Looong wait if you do. The sushi is good not great and the typical Generaol Tso's type Chinese fare is darn good!$LABEL$4
Owner was extremely polite.  Waitress was not the best.  Brought me the wrong beer and the wrong sushi (even after a lengthy explanation that I wanted salmon roe...not salmon or a salmon roll).  The sushi itself was ok but not as good as I would expect from an Uptown establishment.$LABEL$2
Nestled right beside the Hilton hotel and across from Panera bread is a quaint little Chinese & Japanese restaurant. I'd stray away from calling it fusion because the dishes look either strictly Chinese or Japanese. Chinese options include various sauteed dishes with fried meats. Japanese options include all your japanese food fare (so I'd venture to call this a Japanese restaurant that decided to serve Chinese food).  Dinner on a week night around 8pm was pretty empty so no wait for seating. I ordered the rainbow roll and spider roll. Everything was just A-OK.$LABEL$3
I was traveling for work and stayed at the Hilton so figured I would check Fujo out. Great service and really delicious sushi! The prices were very reasonable and the portions were large. I got a spicy tuna roll (always good) and a volcano roll and they were so good. I also got a rainbow martini$LABEL$5
Bloody Mary tastes like dish soap and no hint of alcohol.  STAY AWAY from it.The Godzilla roll is huge$LABEL$3
Nice employees$LABEL$2
They delivered dinner right to my hotel room door.  With a $20 minimum dinner order they'll deliver for free.  When it comes to sushi it's easy to spend that much.  I ordered a serving of won ton soup$LABEL$3
I finally decided to take the long walk across uptown to check out Fujo.  Being that I had to be back for a 1:00 meeting I called my order in around 11:55 and was told 15 minutes.  From the menu online I was a little disappointed to not see Sushi Lunch Options$LABEL$4
Its a good deal for lunch. If you're downtown & need a quick bite$LABEL$3
This review does not apply to sushi. The Chinese food here are typical American Chinese$LABEL$3
We tried Fujo for the last time. We never know if they are delivering. It changes by the day. When they do deliver$LABEL$2
Having limited options in Uptown I gave this place a few chances.  It's just not good.  I got some eel that wasn't fresh and I haven't been able to eat eel since.  I also think their miso soup is actually chicken broth with some miso tossed in.$LABEL$1
I applaud the look of this place and the artistry of the setup at the sushi bar. My primary goal was to relax for half an hour or so between professional obligations and grab an appetizer and a beer$LABEL$3
Overall$LABEL$3
I want to preface this by letting you know  that I am not picky about my sushi. But$LABEL$2
1 star for price and 1 star for atmosphere; however$LABEL$2
Probably the only restaurant that the service was so terrible that I have left before getting my food. Me and my boyfriend went here with a groupon$LABEL$1
I had high expectations for this place$LABEL$2
Good fresh sushi- I go once a week.$LABEL$4
I have been trying to find a good Chinese place ever since I moved here from AZ and this is the first restaurant (along with SOHO) that has been like- able. Food seemed somewhat fresh$LABEL$3
Fujo is hard to find$LABEL$4
Decent food$LABEL$3
If you live uptown$LABEL$5
I would highly recommend Foundation for the Carolinas for an uptown wedding in Charlotte$LABEL$5
I love any place where it seems like I'm the smartest person. Yeah I know$LABEL$4
8 weeks and 2 days after my wife dropped an online class the ordeal of getting the refund is finally over. After weeks of unreturned phone calls$LABEL$1
HORRIBLE college. Good luck going there or getting help when you needi it. The only person I found to be helpful was Brad and he simply shouldnt have to do anybodies job. I will def be contacting higher management due to the lack of communication I have recieved. I do NOT reccommend this school to anyone who is looking to further their education. I have never seen such a horrible COMMUNITY COLLEGE in my life time.$LABEL$1
CPCC provides a great learning environment for students of all ages. Registration can be a hassle and occasionally slow$LABEL$4
It's a fairly new Arby's near downtown. It's right across the street from the new Best Buy$LABEL$3
I'm not the biggest fan of Arby's but if I were to frequent one$LABEL$3
I gave one star because you can't give none!! The manager$LABEL$1
I now understand why I always see people eating in their cars in this parking lot. I didn't make it very far without sneaking a bite$LABEL$4
I think the food here isn't quite as good as Mama's in Plaza-Midwood. But the service is much better$LABEL$4
\""Meh. I've experienced better\"". Don't go for the jerk chicken. It looked like brownstew$LABEL$2
This is my new favorite place. Love love the jerk chicken and collard greens. The curry was really good too$LABEL$5
I almost gave this place 1 star$LABEL$2
I had some clothes dry cleaned here a few days ago.  The turn around was a day$LABEL$2
Love 2001 Cleaners. I only have a few items that need to be dry cleaned$LABEL$5
Wow... Talk about a great service and quality of work. I use these guys for all my dry cleaning and alteration services.  I would strongly recommend trying theses guys for your dry-cleaning needs. Guarantee you won't be dissatisfied......2001 team$LABEL$5
This place is GREAT!  I had a suit and a dress that I needed dry cleaned$LABEL$5
The woman at the counter gave my daughter the stink face when we tried to drop off several items for cleaning. She was rude the entire time$LABEL$1
Prepare for your mind to be blown. This is one of Charlotte's best secrets.It is on N. Davidson in an industrial/sketch area. You walk into this STUNNING garden with plenty of art. It is a delight. You feel like you are transformed into a new place. I cannot recommend this place enough. It feels magical. There are little paths that you can walk to with privacy. There is a large area to be in with a big group. We went for a rehearsal dinner and it was breath taking. I highly recommend going here.$LABEL$5
If you're doing the whole Atkins diet thing-don't even read this review b/c I don't want to be blamed for your downfall. I checked out Great Harvest this morning since I saw I had a BOGO coupon for a honey whole wheat loaf of bread in the Citipass book. Loving all things carbs$LABEL$4
Used to work at a place in the same shopping center and every Saturday I'd go and get myself either a cookie or a Savannah bar or muffin. Some of the best baked goods Charlotte has to offer.$LABEL$4
I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place before.  I stop here at least once a week to get my carb on.  I absolutely love this place$LABEL$4
Sandwich shops are everywhere. So you encounter one that makes their own bread$LABEL$4
Although the price is right and the fried rice is pretty good$LABEL$2
While I hate nailing a place that has so few reviews$LABEL$1
Nothing extraordinary here$LABEL$3
Given this place a few tries. The staff is always super nice$LABEL$2
Sa cha beef was very decent. Good service$LABEL$3
Quick$LABEL$2
I can't say my expectations were too high$LABEL$2
If I could give this place zero stars I would. I ordered the generals chicken because you really can't mess that up. This place did. The red sauce that covered it was so sugary and gross that it tasted like it came from a can.  There was definitely not any white meat in my dish--only chewy fatty tissue that had some dark meat attached to it. The side of fried rice tasted fine but it didn't have any of the usual carrots or peas in it so it lacked in flavor. I have yet to find a really good Chinese take out in Charlotte.$LABEL$1
Very dirty and disgusting. Sat down and he brought out egg noodles and duck sauce. Long black hair right on top. Got up and walked out.$LABEL$1
I wish zero stars were an option. I placed a delivery order and was told it would take 30-45 minutes to arrive. After waiting for 90 minutes and placing three calls to the store$LABEL$1
We used to go to the Emperor years ago with our young children and had fond memories of the place.  It was a mom & pop shop$LABEL$1
This place is failing in every way: their service is dismal$LABEL$1
The CD Warehouse is kind of like a used bookstore$LABEL$3
This is a great laundromat! It was clean$LABEL$5
Super sweet owners. Husband has been using their dry cleaning services for his work clothes and they have a fast turn around and remember their customers which is a plus. I know this because the 1st time I took in my husband's clothes they remembered his name and what clothes were dropped off previously.We didn't have a washer & dryer at one point so I brought in 3 loads of laundry but forgot the detergent. The owners were nice enough to load me some and helped me transfer my laundery from the W to the D. I had my 2 young kids and they were very kind to them too! It's obvious that they are a mom & pop shop that truly care for their customers. We've moved away from them 2 months ago but still go out of our way to go there.$LABEL$5
My husband is in law enforcement and has been wanting to try an area dry cleaners to have his uniforms washed and pressed. After doing some research on Yelp$LABEL$2
It's cheap and fast! The employees are friendly and provide good service. Don't expect fine detailing the entire car$LABEL$3
I love Autobell but it feels like this location is a little slower (probably just because of the volume of traffic) and not quite as attentive to detail. To get any tire gloss or anything beyond a hose-down$LABEL$3
Worst auto bell in town. Do not go here. It wasn't even decent enough for one star.$LABEL$1
This location has done the best job on our car to date. The staff hoofs it with each vehicle and it's easy to see from the intersection of 3rd and Charlottetowne. Came in for a full-service wash on a Saturday. Went with the super$LABEL$4
These guys took ME to the cleaner!I used this dry cleaner for the first time recently$LABEL$1
I unfortunately have not been able to make it to this fine establishment for any meal other than breakfast.  But let me tell you it was well worth dragging my tired butt out of bed and heading to my sucky job early so that I could swing by this place.The employees are friendly and welcoming even at 7am$LABEL$5
Driving down 7th$LABEL$2
Solid deli with good ingredients$LABEL$4
I have only been once. Nice staff. Quality ingredients. Tasty and fresh cold cut subs. I had the Italian. Yum!$LABEL$4
You know how you have specific tastes and you try to stick with places that will be a good fit for you? But then you also want to branch out and try something new? Yeah... so$LABEL$3
If you're looking to redo the garden or lawn this is a great place to come.  It has a variety of fountains and lawn decorations$LABEL$3
I agree with the other reviewers that this is a great shop not only for plants$LABEL$5
Looks like just another house from the outside as you go zooming by on 7th Street$LABEL$4
Completely charming. A true respite from the busy city!! I found something for the gardener that has everything.$LABEL$5
While I like the Melting Pot$LABEL$4
If liking Melting Pot is wrong$LABEL$4
I like the food and the whole fondue experience of the Melting Pot but I give this place only 2 stars because on my last 2 visits$LABEL$2
I am a fan$LABEL$4
I feel about fondue about the way I feel about eating blue crabs. The work$LABEL$3
I really love Melting Pot! The concept is exciting enough$LABEL$3
Am I the only one who doesn't get it?  I thought it was kinda weird...First of all$LABEL$3
We had an amazing time visiting this restaurant recently to celebrate my sister's birthday. Its hard to find something special for her because she eats gluten free. They exceeded our expectations with the amount of thought and effort they put into making the experience great for all of us$LABEL$5
We always hit The Melting Pot during Restuarant Week$LABEL$5
Despite years of resisting this place because it is a both a chain and the idea of cooking my own food$LABEL$3
If you are ever in town the ying yong is awesome. This is a very unique and excellent restaurant. I would highly recommend.$LABEL$5
I've been there couple weeks ago. And it was my first time. We had to wait a few minutes to get seated. We had a 5 course meal and the best part was desert. Imagine yourself a plate with strawberries and bananas and velvet cake and other cakes and pastry that you can dip in the melted chocolate. Staff is all around friendly and effecient. In general I liked it. I'd say it can be a good romantic place for couples. Find time when you are not in rush and can spend and enjoy the food and each others company for about 3 hours since you'll be cooking in the pots right in front of you on your table. Can be a good unrushed experience. Thanks Melting Pot!$LABEL$4
I can't say enough about the mouth watering food here! The cheese$LABEL$5
We waited to come back to the Melting Pot after our last experience during restaurant week. This time we came with a different couple for Double Date Nights$LABEL$4
Had reservations for 6:30p for the 4 course restaurant week special. Arrived about 5 minutes early and were promptly seated. Our server$LABEL$5
They short pour drinks! Tiny drink glasses (the smallest I've ever seen) and loaded with ice. Maybe an ounce in a $8.50 drink$LABEL$3
My boyfriend and I stopped here for a Valentines Day date and we thought the place was decent. The waiters are very friendly and they explain the menu really well. They also offer great suggestions to first time customers. This was definitely a great first time experience especially for people who have never tried fondue style cooking. I thought that cooking appetizers$LABEL$3
You wont regret it$LABEL$5
OMG!!!! Best place EVER!!! I go there every year for my birthday. I love how many they options that they have. Also the dessert is AMAZING!!!!!$LABEL$5
The Tina's are wonderful! Walk up from Elizabeth or Plaza Midwood and enter nail heaven. Best Pedicure and Massage I've had ( & I travel a LOT). Gellish paint is great for all types$LABEL$5
Went to get nails done for the panthers playoff game. Wanted a black base w/ blue stripes. The younger girl did them and did a bad job. The worst part she even told me it was \""not her best\"" and she was disappointed with how she did them. The lines were all different sizes. She made an excuse that the brush was too big. She was about 3/4 of the way done and about 4 woman came in to get their nails done...the girl decided to rush through my nails to quickly get me done$LABEL$1
I just moved to the area and was dreading the task of finding a new nail salon.  I loved my old salon and was very sad to leave$LABEL$5
It's definitely strange when I say that we need to call our electrician$LABEL$4
I'm not entirely sure why$LABEL$3
Maybe it's time to pull out those old Tom Petty records$LABEL$5
I found the customer service here to be less than desirable. The lady was either having  bad day or was a real grouch. Seemed very annoyed in helping us. On top of that there are NO returns..even unworn and tags on . I would not go there again.$LABEL$2
This is a good little place to get a cheap$LABEL$3
I'm not a fan of watered down vinegar sauce with a few specs of tomato at all.  I gave it two-stars just not to be a jerk$LABEL$2
I've actually never had Art's barbecue (though I love that they spell \""barbecue\"" with a \""c\"" - a man after my own heart).  I've only been here for breakfast.I realize these days that your breakfast fare is generally split into two categories - fast food$LABEL$3
Not too bad$LABEL$2
Great for breakfast. Quick$LABEL$4
Breakfast is a 4$LABEL$3
Absolutely the best breakfast biscuits in town! This place is a Charlotte staple! Also try the party pack for larger catering needs$LABEL$5
Maybe my standards are too high. I had high hopes for the breakfast biscuits here$LABEL$2
I have been going to Palestra to see Sharon for a long time. The spa is extremely relaxing and welcoming. Sharon always does a excellent job. I always look forward to my next appointment. I  look and feel wonderful every time I leave. They are the best.$LABEL$5
I usually prefer body wraps to massages$LABEL$5
I haven't eaten here that many times$LABEL$4
When you think of a nice Italian restaurant$LABEL$4
Mama Ricotta's is one of my favorite restaurants in Charlotte and one of the best Italian restaurants in the QC. Their food is delicious and I've always had positive experiences there. Try not to fill up on the bread$LABEL$4
YES!!!!  Mama catered my wedding and it was perfect.  If you want to die and go to heaven$LABEL$5
Delicious!! I heard so many good things about this restaurant and finally tried it! Now it is one of my favorites in Charlotte. Their pork ribs are outstanding and I now crave the goat cheese and mascarpone appetizer. The portions were huge. My boyfriend and I splitt the pork ribs and we were both stuffed. Everything I've tried at Mama Ricotta's has been fabulous!$LABEL$5
I have been enjoying Mama Ricotta's for many years and went again last night.  Friends that were joining us were late$LABEL$4
Ive had good and bad experiences here- Ive been three times: Overall I would go back ive decided Decent prices and decent (not wonderful) Italian food. The first time I ordered the vodka riggies- which came recommended...While they were ok I make much better at home so I wasn't impressed. My family didnt care for their lunches either 2nd time- I was sick so I ordered soup and salad- I dont think its fair to judge on this- my boyfriend raved about his meal (he has a special pasta with lobster sauce) 3rd - I finally found something I really enjoyed here ! I had the Pollo Carciofi ...delicious! I did substitute the polenta but the chicken was fabulous ...I will definitely come back!I also had the red sangria which I enjoyed more than Maggianos Service has always been great- try to call ahead if you can$LABEL$4
First time I went we had a large party of 10$LABEL$2
Let me be clear: the 2nd star is based solely on the efforts of the staff to turn around our abysmal food experience. Based on food alone it would be a single star$LABEL$2
Old south Charlotte standby ... this is just a great option when you want something comfortable ... but not TOO comfortable (meaning you will eat well here).  Short of fine dining$LABEL$4
What is it with this place? It's like a weird mutant baby of Ruby Tuesday and the Cheesecake Factory born in 1994 - I swear they even have the same mix of fun n' funky jams you've heard in your favorite RT's playing in the background. They most definitely have the same feel - messy food paintings full of edgy$LABEL$2
I have been meaning to eat here for a while$LABEL$5
I have to preface with the fact that I'm not a huge fan of Italian food.I was unimpressed with the customer service: the server was apparently not typically on the floor as she was the bartender. My first question is \""Why?\"" She got our order incorrect (which actually ended up being a good thing) but was a bit slow.  I usually like all salads but I did NOT like the chopped salad. For some reason$LABEL$3
This place makes me cringe! I've dined here with large groups of friends when we needed to have a big table and they all wanted to be bursting full of cheap food and that is really the only excuse to go to this place. One reviewer mentioned the 90's music and the goofy food art on the walls. I could not agree more that this is so funny. Whoa and talk about noisy. This place is deafening inside on a Friday or Saturday night$LABEL$2
Oh my$LABEL$4
Let me start off by saying I love GOOD Italian food$LABEL$2
Went during charlottes restaurant week$LABEL$2
Mama Ricotta's sets out to be good old fashioned Italian home cooking$LABEL$3
Let me start by saying$LABEL$2
Looking for a good lunch stop? Try Mama Ricotta's. It's in a convenient location just south of Uptown or just outside the Dilworth area...perfect for a quick business lunch. I think other people have the same idea because there were a lot of business-dressed patrons filling every seat.If you plan on talking to secure that business deal$LABEL$3
Itttt's Restaurant Week - Hooray!  So$LABEL$3
Fantastic Italian food!!  I have been going here for years and after a recent visit I realized I never reviewed it!  My favorite app here is the goat cheese and bread.  They drizzle the sauce around the plate so you get a hearty mix of the cheese and sauce mixture for your bread - YUM.  I have liked every pasta dish I have ordered here - and the pizza is made in their wood-fired oven.  Recently I got the pasta with vodka sauce - it is so much food!  Very delicious but heavy$LABEL$3
The Food at Mama Ricotta's is very good!  The Pasta Entrees  are fresh and they have a wide variety of Dishes!!!!!!$LABEL$4
I'm always surprised how good the food at Mama Ricotta's is.  I've been there twice$LABEL$3
Best$LABEL$4
On Friday night the office I work for had our Christmas Party at Mama Ricotta's. It was a great time$LABEL$2
First night time visit to Mama's..wow this place is a goldmine..packed with people$LABEL$3
So fine...so good...every time with everything.I broke my habit by not ordering the wonderlishous lasagne and opted for the vodka penne.  Superb.  Wife had a special:  tubes with a short rib ragu which was extraordinary and very rich.  Yes$LABEL$5
Made a reservation for 7:30 via OT$LABEL$4
I have some mixed feelings about Mama Ricotta's$LABEL$4
Y'ALL CLEARLY HAVE NEVER EATEN OUTSIDE OF CHARLOTTE. Mama ricotta's is a 1/2 step above olive garden$LABEL$2
Queen's Feast Friday night.  As usual delicious food. And a knowledgeable and personable server$LABEL$5
The food here is great$LABEL$3
Wow. Looks can be deceiving. I avoided this place (even though I heard it was good) b/c of the name and location.Lucky for me$LABEL$4
Bookmarked for six months$LABEL$4
Let me start out by saying: I love Mama Ricotta's food. I've had several great experiences both in the restaurant and with their catering. That being said$LABEL$3
Finally was afforded the chance to try this place out.  I've heard many great things and can't say that they were wrong at all.Started out with garlic knot bread that was delicious and warm and melted like butter.  I followed that up with a seafood dish that had Prince Edward island oysters and shrimp.  So good!  The setting here is romantic and makes for a great date spot.  Our waiter was great$LABEL$3
Seriously$LABEL$5
Had the pasta special last night at Mama's and it was unreal.  Pure breast meat chicken bolognese in a tomato sauce with perfectly cooked rigatoni. Chef Drew hits another home run.$LABEL$5
I'll give that their food is really good....but$LABEL$2
This place didn't have the authentic taste I was looking for. The atmosphere is nice but the food quality was lacking.$LABEL$2
Awesome meal - flavorful food$LABEL$4
My experience here was good. Host or owner was very nice at the front$LABEL$3
Maybe we came on an off night? We used to really like their lasagna and pizza. The visit before this one$LABEL$2
I've been going here since 2000 but never have fallen in love with it like everyone else. Maybe I'm weird. Maybe I've got a very sensitive palette. Maybe I'm just not average$LABEL$2
service was great$LABEL$3
My husband and I tried this place a few weeks ago and absolutely loved it! The warm goat cheese appetizer is to DIE for! My husband ordered the pizza with in house made chicken sausage and was in love! I had the cheese ravioli and it was delicious. We will definitely be going back. Great service and atmosphere.$LABEL$5
This is not what qualifies as \""Good Italian.\"" Perhaps there is an Italian village where this is identical to what they serve$LABEL$3
Mediocre Italian food. I had a pizza and it was quite bland. The waiter was nice$LABEL$2
The food here was just adequate. And the ridiculous part of our lunch was that the check  was delivered before the meal! What's that about? The waiter said they get really busy so they bring the check first. I've been eating out in restaurants for many years and no one has every brought the check before a morsel of food was eaten. The menu states that whole wheat pasta is available but never mentions it's a $1.50 up charge. I might return someday but I won't be anytime soon.$LABEL$2
I ordered take out from here once when I was staying at a hotel in downtoen Charlotte for work. I found it on yelp and looked like they had some delicious menu items and were also close to where I was staying. I always try new places that are not chains and this one had lots of items I was interested in. I looked at the menu and ended up ordering the goat cheese and mascropone appetizer that you also got with crostini and marinera sauce$LABEL$4
We came here to celebrate my college graduation. I looked at TripAdvisor for a Italian restaurant good for kids and for special celebrations. That lead me to Mama's. However..... obviously people reviewing here and giving 5 stars don't know about Italian culinary. The restaurant menu includes a briefing about the owner's family and history. They can indeed be Italians but they have managed to create a menu based upon what us Americans think about Italian food (pasta sauces and breads with loads of garlic on it and lasagna with ricotta cheese on it). Just take as an example Olive Garden.... and I am not comparing Mama's to Olive Garden as the food here is much better$LABEL$2
My husband and I came here for dinner before going to the Knights game. He usually stops in for the lunch specials from the Metropolitan and wanted to show me the place. We were sat right away and given bread and oil. It was ok$LABEL$3
Been to Mamas dozens of times over the past 10 years.The last few times out experience was just fair.Last night we went there for a birthday dinner...mistake1st thing they put the 7 of us in a small table for 6 max...how to you have any room for the food? DUH (plus the place was not even busy)They did accommodate us after my request to put 2 tables together.We ordered a few appetizers to start...one of them being the mozzarella and tomatoes$LABEL$1
This terrific casual Italian place in Charlotte's Midtown neighborhood is a great spot for lunch$LABEL$3
Everything was wonderful.  Had my birthday dinner here$LABEL$5
This place is always spot on. The wine selection is always excellent and the food makes you close your eyes and say wow!  Great for any occasion and really fun for a special occasion. Desserts...gotta safe room or just do it anyway.$LABEL$5
Used call ahead seating on a Friday night and glad we did because the placed was busy. That's always a good sign.The food was excellent and we took advantage of the drink specials.We sat on the patio which was nice.We would go again.$LABEL$4
We were in Charlotte this past weekend and we were in the mood for Italian$LABEL$4
I do not have much to say about this place other than the food is horrible.the people are nice but the food is horrible if you are itialian and the cook is not even itialian.stay away if you want real itialian food.$LABEL$1
Perfect location for group birthday!  Great food$LABEL$4
I don't say this lightly$LABEL$5
Great video store...huge selection of indy and foreign films$LABEL$4
The selection is awesome... but the customer service is a deal breaker  After I brought in a movie late 5 days late and asked to pay the late fee$LABEL$3
I had to give up on Visart because they are pretty strict with the late fees$LABEL$3
Visart is one of the few independent video stores I know of in Charlotte. It's got an awesome selection of mainstream and offbeat films that you might not be able to find elsewhere. The store is broken up into interesting sections with some film-makers receiving their own rows. I've dealt with some rude employees there too$LABEL$3
Entering Visart Video is like what I would imagine walking into Netflix would look like. The selection is ridiculous$LABEL$5
They used to be so cool. Took money out of my account for late fees. Never notified me$LABEL$1
UPDATE! Received an email from the owner which was a little intimidating stated that I should remove my post. Kinda think they should improve customer service then send an email.$LABEL$1
Awesome selection but staff are very rude$LABEL$3
If I'm not heading out on the town Friday or Saturday night$LABEL$5
Occasionally you can hear people in our town talking about how we need to support the arts. If that's your cause$LABEL$5
I used to appreciate V Cleaners & Alterations for their speedy service$LABEL$2
My husband is expensive.  Sorry honey$LABEL$4
I went to Biggs to rent a lens for my Canon XSi. Biggs is in a nice area--although it's sort of on the fringe of leaving it. It's a camera store$LABEL$3
So$LABEL$3
Rude staff$LABEL$1
I was thinking about a particular camera$LABEL$5
I had an emergency on the morning I was leaving for Europe.  I literally said to myself$LABEL$1
The Big Chill is a very large$LABEL$3
Very nice venueI saw Jon Gordon speaker for the NEW (executive women) and was impressed with food and how upscale it is$LABEL$4
A neighborhood stalwart and a gem (21 years strong$LABEL$4
HANDS DOWN favorite place to get a sub! Meat$LABEL$5
This Substation II used to be my favorite place to grab a quick bite... but this past year I've been really disappointed. Either my tastes have improved or the quality has gone downhill.The hummus wrap used to be my jam$LABEL$2
Probably one of the better locations in Charlotte for this sandwich chain.  I don't know that there are bad choices on this menu.  None are 'the best thing I've ever eaten'$LABEL$3
Great Subs!$LABEL$5
Visulite reminds me of the House of Blues in Chicago.  If you're not in the pit or the first row of seating$LABEL$3
Best venue in town to see a show.  Over the years$LABEL$5
This is a superb club to see and hear music. I think it was an art deco movie theater originally$LABEL$4
The Visulite consistently ranks in my \""Top 3 Venues to See Live Music\"" category.   The bar staff is efficient and drink prices are reasonable.  The variety of shows booked hear ensure that there's something for everyone to enjoy.$LABEL$4
I saw a Colour Academy and Public Radio concert at Visulite. It is a sweet spot with a tables and chairs option or a pit in front of the stage to stand or dance in. Wide selection of beers and other drinks for a decent price. My only complaint at Visulite was the smoke. I'm not a smoker myself and I hate leaving places smelling like stale cigarettes.$LABEL$4
Has the potential for a sweet$LABEL$2
I've been hitting different venues around Charlotte for years listening to live music...including Visulite Theatre.  It's a favorite pastime of mine.  Last night we went to check out Shooter Jennings (who is awesome by the way).  When I got there I asked one of the bartenders for a couple of waters.  He had immediate attitude b/c I wanted water and then charged $3 per bottle.  Later$LABEL$2
First-time at the Visulite last night to see a local band my husband knew.  Though we've been in CLT for a good six months$LABEL$4
I came her with some friends to see the band SOJA. this is one of my favorite venues to see a live show anywhere! The inside has multiple levels and there is not a bad place anywhere - standing room only unless you get there early enough to grab one of the few bar tables and stools. The bar is large and can handle many people wanting drinks at one time. You get the feeling that you are on top of the bands when they are playing - a great intimate experience and makes you feel like they are playing at your house. Tip the bartenders well and they remember your drink orders$LABEL$4
This is a great music venue!It's compact but it got everything you could want.... There is a bar in the back with cheap drinks and speedy service and it's elevated so you can see the band and hear the music the whole time you are getting your pops. A railed walk way that leads right down to the front right in  front of the stage$LABEL$4
I was at the Visulite Saturday night and it was a terrible experience. I bought tickets online 2 days prior to the show. It was listed as a headliner and that the doors opened at 8pm with 2 opening acts. We got there right on time and were denied entrance. Jam Base had listed it as one show and when I bought tickets on the Visulite website it was for 1 show. We were aggressively all told that we would have to pay for the first person on stage or we would have to come back later. What? Then we were told$LABEL$1
One of the least likely places to fine a good venue in Charlotte would be in Elizabeth$LABEL$4
Cool venue.  If you love live music then this place is for you.  Strange bands but cool seating if you arrive early.$LABEL$4
Seriously the best UPS store in town. I'm not one to send a package every day$LABEL$5
After being a loyal customer to this location and a UPS My Choice customer$LABEL$2
My sister had to come here for a minor operation$LABEL$4
I have to disagree with these other reviews.  Presbyterian is a joke.  Unfortunately our primary care physician is right around the corner$LABEL$1
Not a Trauma Hospital$LABEL$3
Had to take my mom in for an out patient surgery the other week.  Everything went well and the people are so friendly.  I did notice that the surgical waiting room was jam packed (due to construction)... but it's nice since the front desk of the waiting room keeps tabs on you and takes your cell phone number down so that you receive updates on your loved one.  When the procedure starts$LABEL$4
HORRIBLE HOSPITAL!!!!!!!!!!!Checked my mother in for a cough via Emergency room. DR wanted to keep her overnight and staff told us a room was available. SEVEN HOURS LATER they took her up to a room....finally ER stopped waiting on someone to transport her and took her up to the room on her own....THE WORST SERVICE IMAGINABLE FOR A A HEALTH CARE PROVIDER!$LABEL$1
My dad had a mild heart attack & was transferred from Presby-Huntersville to Presby-main. On a late Thursday morning he was transferred to a rather busy cardiac care department. It was established early that morning that he would need a heart cath & possibly a stint. From 10:30 AM to 6:00 PM$LABEL$2
We were here to support our sister/daughter during the birth of her twin boys. The babies had to stay in the NICU and the nurses were very nice and helpful.However$LABEL$2
This review is for the maternity ward specifically.I have had 2 children here and it was such an awesome experience both times.  Dr. Morris is the best OB/GYN$LABEL$5
Though I'm a Copper enthusiast when it comes to getting my Indian fix in Charlotte$LABEL$2
Although hubby and I eat Indian food everyday at home...we were craving North Indian fare which I rarely get around to making at home. We went on a Saturday night...it wasn't packed so we got seated right away. Most of their patronage are non Indians which often means that the food is good but not spicy. Hubby and I are huge fans of spicy food as I've mentioned in previous reviews. Hubby got the Chicken tandoori and I got the chicken vindaloo (which is supposed to be spicy) and is a Goan speciality...something I am very familiar with :o) When the waiter came by hubby and I asked him if he could make these dishes spicy. He looked at us and asked \""Indian spicy\"" and we both grinned away and said absolutely. And they delivered! The flavors were great and it satisfied our spiceometer. The only thing is would say is the vindaloo could have been a bit more sour. The tandoori chicken was moist and yum. But the highlight had to be the garlic naan. They didn't go cheap on the garlic and the naan was soft and delish!! Service was polite and fast. and then thew in some extra butter chicken sauce even though we didn't order any. Sooooo goooood. We will be going back when we get cravings for Indian AND spicy food!$LABEL$3
it was ok$LABEL$2
I travel to CLT fairly regular on business. Went here with some co-workers and was disapponted. Waitstaff was not helpful with the menu. The food was mediocre at best. Had the paneer appetizer and it tasted like they were trying to make a McNugget with cheese. Sauces were tasty but now I wonder if they came from a can. If you really want great Indian food... Go to Copper. If you want McIndian go for it.$LABEL$2
Solid Indian fare. I was high from all the butter fat I consumed at dinner for$LABEL$3
I went here for dinner on a Friday night. The place was empty and only one group walked in after me and my fiance. Oddly enough$LABEL$2
After I wrote this$LABEL$1
Best Indian food I have had in Charlotte$LABEL$3
Having lived for 3 years in the Silicon Valley$LABEL$2
I've yet to try Woodlands$LABEL$3
The service here is great. We went on a Sunday and were the only people there for a while$LABEL$4
The atmosphere of Maharani is nice. Quiet$LABEL$2
Had the Sunday lunch buffet recently and I guess I'm just not used the style of service.  The food was pretty good though  I don't know the names of the dishes$LABEL$3
I like Indian food$LABEL$3
The lunch buffet is really great$LABEL$5
I really want to love this restaurant but I really don't. I have tried it at the lunch buffet and I recently ordered rice$LABEL$2
After visiting a number of restaurants for the buffet$LABEL$2
very avg lik most other indian restaurant !! though its decent compared to the price (9 bucks buffet )!!$LABEL$2
I ordered carryout at Maharani on my way home from work; I ordered the Murg Curry and garlic naan. The chicken in the murg curry was extremely dry and tough$LABEL$2
It's okay. Nothing to write home about. I thought their portions were good$LABEL$3
Maharani is a pretty solid 3-stars in my book.Considering Woodlands Indian is my most favorite restaurant in the world$LABEL$3
It has been a long time since I have felt the need to \""Yelp\"".  Eating here night before last has brought me back to Yelp....and not in a good way.The best thing about our meal was my Diet Coke.The wait staff had to be reminded several times of what we ordered.  The food was not to my liking at all.  Honestly and truly ...as I was eating I was reminded of the scene in National Lampoon's European Vacation when Clark and crew at the French restaurant near the Eiffel Tower.The food tasted like it had been frozen and warmed up.  I have honestly had better RTE meals from Patel Brothers grocery store.  You know the type...the ones that come in the box for like 3 bucks....Very disappointed.$LABEL$1
I eat Indian weekly and from all over NC and SC. I find Maharani to be the best in Charlotte. Their  buffet quality is outstanding. I have eaten here for years.  I have not been to Saffron$LABEL$5
This place was good for Charlotte. They did spicy and naan very well. I would come back after I have tried other clt restaurants!$LABEL$3
The food tastes good but is extremely bland and so lacks the Indian experience. The servers were not a friendly and approachable. However the service was quick.$LABEL$3
Heard from a source I trusted that this was the best Indian food in Charlotte so we checked it out. I'd still recommend Woodlands as my top choice. I went with the standard chana masala with medium spice. Sadly$LABEL$3
Excellent food. Very clean restaurant. Very friendly staff. What more could you ask for! The mint chutney is genuine$LABEL$4
When me and my boyfriend came in$LABEL$2
Really rude and non Indian people.....I have never had such a bad experience with any restaurant let alone Indian.....god bless them. I would be interested in seeing how long they can stay in business with this attitude.$LABEL$1
Was very disappointed with level of quality and service. Ordered to go and gave clear instructions to have two separate meals. Each with naan and rice and utensils for work. Arrived to find one bag. One rice and one naan. I pointed this out and they fixed it but they forgot the naan. Looked at $35!!!! Bill and saw they double charged for the naan too. The vindaloo chicken was not spicy enough and very oily. The employees spoke very little English and that was a huge barrier. They also seemed arrogant and rude. I am thinking that most of these reviews are fake or people do not know what good Indian is. This was the worst Indian I've had in Charlotte. At twice the price. I now know why this place is always empty.  I have also tried the lunch buffet and while the price was better. The spice was horrible. All bland$LABEL$1
I guess when you grow up eating authentic Indian food$LABEL$2
This was a great meal but with rushed service.  We had dinner on a weekday. My mother ordered the murg vindaloo \""Indian hot\"" and loved the level of spiciness.  I order the kadhai paneer medium. Now$LABEL$4
I've eaten dinner here a couple times.For the most part$LABEL$3
I've been here tons of times and NEVER had a bad meal or bad service. In fact$LABEL$4
Very few items on lunch buffet. On menu was aloo tikki$LABEL$1
I went with a few friends for dinner and the food was \""good.\""  Good sauces$LABEL$3
Won't be back. I will preface my review by saying that I am a stickler for adequate customer service. That said$LABEL$1
The reviews seemed to be hit-or-miss$LABEL$3
If I could$LABEL$1
I'll say I'm a fan even though I can agree with the other reviewer that customer service here might be an issue.  You really have to get past that though.  The gentlemen that runs this place is strictly business and it's a business he's good at.I can't speak to the dry cleaning side$LABEL$4
They get an automatic bump to 4 stars for brazenly being the only malaysian joint in town. Despite being all over the map (sushi$LABEL$4
I've frequented Cuisine Malaya more than any other restaurant in Charlotte.  Mainly because of the consistency of the flavors and the affordability.  I like the wooden beams and the loft-like feeling you get once inside.   I love their lunch specials$LABEL$4
Get the Malaysian fried rice. Unbelievable. If you're into sushi$LABEL$4
Each time I've eaten here$LABEL$5
Delicious & unique.  You can't go wrong here.$LABEL$4
I was introduced to Cuisine Malaya by a good friend$LABEL$4
YUMMM...This place has delicious food and good service.  My favs are the Curry Lakhsa$LABEL$5
I cannot get enough of this place. Food: Fresh$LABEL$5
I tried this place out Tuesday night with a fellow yelper friend after a trip to the Mint Museum on Randolph and wasn't as impressed as some of the other reviewers I see for Cuisine Malaya.   The menu is extensive though a strange combination of Chinese$LABEL$3
food here is ok.menu has various dishes from different asian country.duck spring roll is not good. it only has two little thin slices of duck meat.beef skewer is okIndian pancake with stuffing is quite goodwe ordered also one Malaysian beef dish which is really good. sauce is perfect and meat is very soft.Noodle that we ordered is a bit dry.service is good.when you go there best to go a bit early for dinner because later at night the parking lot is packed from people going to the dance club next door.$LABEL$3
When you eat the real deal I guess you're a lot tougher.  I had laksa there.  VERY ho-hum and way way way too large.  No reasonable person can eat a huge soup like that and since when is laksa supposed to be that soupy?  And....unfortunately....it tasted...well....prepackaged.  Their other Asian cuisine isn't bad.  I guess for Charlotte it's a bit of an adventure but I found it rather generic.$LABEL$2
Cuisine Malaya offers a great lunch menu.  My first experience was very good.  The Roti with curry sauce was very flavorful.   The Malaysian fried rice with chicken was very good.   It was prepared with a little spice...but I added some wonderful roasted chili pepper sauce to bring it up a little.  simply wonderful.  The service was good and delivery was quick.  No waiting!  Parking was very adequate on both sides of the restaurant.  I will be returning to try other Indo-Asian dishes!!!!$LABEL$4
This place is amazing! They have the best Roti Canai! I am not much of a sushi fan$LABEL$4
I used to get takeout from here like every week when I had class at CPCC. Caveat:  I have only been to like two Malaysian restaurants in my life$LABEL$3
I had high hopes for Cuisine Malaya since it has a great rating and had been recommended by 2 separate friends but my experience was not beyond adequate. We stopped in about an hour before close on a Saturday night and the place was surprisingly empty. True it's a large space$LABEL$3
I came here for lunch and had the okra dish with chicken. There was something really odd about it - like they used dirty oil or a dirty pan for the stir-fry. I was quite disappointed. The bathroom was also a bit dirty. I think for great Malaysian food in the US you have to go to the DC area or California.$LABEL$2
Try the Stingray! So delicious. Great service too.$LABEL$5
I love this place. Everything I've had was delicious!I still vividly remember my first visit here$LABEL$4
The variety and options at Cuisine Malaya are pretty amazing and it also seems to be the most vegetarian friendly (of non strictly vegetarian restaurants) i've been to in Charlotte. The chicken curry was good and roti canai is always a winner. Probably my favorite thing I've had there so far is the basil duck.$LABEL$4
Best word to describe Cuisine Malaya: decent.I've never ordered anything I disliked$LABEL$3
I'd like to eat there again$LABEL$2
This was absolutely terrible.  It was so highly reviewed$LABEL$1
I'm really confused about the positive reviews of this place. The wait staff was nice - that's the only reason I gave then two stars instead of one. We should have known to skip this place when we saw the cheesy plastic sign and neon logo$LABEL$2
I ordered take out of Tom Yum soup and Chilli Chicken$LABEL$1
You must try the roti canai appetizer!$LABEL$4
I have been to this place a few times and enjoyed the flavors. However I was VERY DISAPPOINTED for their lack of \""respect\"" to what a customer orders.  I order my usual the MEE GORENG with TOFU and as I combed through and had a couple of bites I found a strip of chicken.  I lost my appetite and was gravely disappointed by their lack of detail to a vegetarian dish.  This place is black listed for me and I hope to find a better Malaysian place in the Queen City.$LABEL$1
This review is about the FOOD only! I'm in town and without a vehicle so naturally I was looking up some tasty delivery options on yelp$LABEL$1
Score 1 for Yelp!  After a failed attempt to eat at a local hotspot I re-check my Yelp bookmarks and voila!  There's Cuisine Malaya$LABEL$4
This may be the best Asian cuisine place uptown. A nice dining experience$LABEL$4
Love this place. Great sushi. Great service.$LABEL$5
We are regulars here$LABEL$5
I had the Roti Canai$LABEL$5
Always make sure to scrutinize a resturant review from a college student.It's more than likely based on the cost of beers rather than food quality. My sushi was warm$LABEL$1
I don't remember going to many Malaysian restaurants in the past. So I tried this on my first visit to Elizabeth neighborhood on one rainy night on a Friday. It was worth it! I really liked the roti cani. The roti was cold but the perfect and spicy gravy compensated for that. I would highly recommend everyone to try roti canai$LABEL$3
What an eclectic restaurant! They say they're Japanese and  Malaysian$LABEL$4
Love this place.  This place served Thai$LABEL$5
My boyfriend and I have been coming to this place for a long time. The food was great and the service was great! Everything started to fall apart once the original manager was forced to quit his position. The food quantity and quality started to go down hill. There was hair in my food not once but TWICE every time I order a rice dish. The new owner did not care to apologize and he was offended I even brought it up. The sushi is very plain and not high quality either. As a college student$LABEL$1
not good - food is below average.. I will never go back$LABEL$2
Decent for a city like Charlotte$LABEL$3
don't feel like it's a authentic malaysia restaurant...the food is more like chinese.$LABEL$3
I'm always a fan of Cuisine Malaya!  The food is best at lunch because it's so cheap.  I always get the pan fried noodles... it's good.  Oh$LABEL$4
I'd just about given up finding really good Asian food in the Charlotte area. When all the Chinese restaurants smell$LABEL$5
Pretty awful entrees$LABEL$2
I've been going to the Yoga Center for years even though I still go to other studios.   Phyliss is the only Iyengar certified teacher in Charlotte and is a true gem of a teacher.  If you want to learn about yoga or are just starting out this is a great place to start your practice.  If you are experienced or prefer another style of yoga$LABEL$5
This is the cutest little place.  You instantly feel like a true lady or gentleman when walking into this place.  They have all kind of gourmet salads and sandwiches to go with your afternoon tea.  They also have a variety of wines to have with dinner or you can take a bottle home.  They cater and do private parties$LABEL$4
I will never be able to say enough about Elizabeth and the staff at La Tea Da's. They are beyond amazing! They catered our wedding reception and I have never heard so many compliments about food from guests at a wedding!! They also created a signature drink that was a huge hit and went above and beyond to make sure me$LABEL$5
This place is everything that you expect from the name$LABEL$4
This is the worst Chinese restaurant that I have ever eaten at.  I went here because of the good reviews but was very disappointed.  I don't write many reviews$LABEL$1
I'm not the biggest fan of carryout Chinese joints and it's far & few between that any of them are actually any good. A lot of the foods at these places all tend to taste alike.  Having said that$LABEL$3
Meh. I've experienced better. The staff is friendly. Just basic chinese food.$LABEL$2
The store is a wall to wall display of the latest comics and graphic novel releases.  They also have a selection of character figurines and memorabilia.  Parking in the lot next to it is easy and they have a bike rack out front.  This is probably one of the nicest comic book shops I've ever been in.These guys also organize the annual Heroes Convention in June which is a cornucopia of comic books$LABEL$5
There is every kind of comic book genre imaginable in this place.  Including the entire Akira series$LABEL$5
This place is ok. The people who work there are amazing though. They love what they do and they enjoy helping you. They have a great comic book selection however$LABEL$2
Heroes is a comic person's heaven.  I'm not into comics$LABEL$4
My husband$LABEL$5
Best place in Charlotte for comics$LABEL$2
Just getting back into reading comics again and it has been an easy transition with this store in town. It's a very polished up comic book shop and I love it! Have yet to go into the store and not gotten into a good discussion about anything from NPR$LABEL$5
This is a Great Place!  Great Escape!  Frank Miller's: Sin City$LABEL$5
I will admit$LABEL$3
About a year ago I got back into comic books.  I haven't read many since I was a kid but I've still followed many storylines and happenings.  When I decided I wanted to give it a go again$LABEL$5
PRO = This place is nice and polished.  Lots of statues and busts (which I like) nicely displayed.  Very organized.CON = Staff is nice enough but nothing that really makes you feel welcome.  Prices are retail - and in some cases higher.  MY EXPERIENCE = I identified several pieces I wanted (about $300.00 worth) but was told there were no quantity discounts.  Now$LABEL$2
THE GOOD:Great selection.  I am an avid collector of statues and some comics.  You  need something$LABEL$3
Great shop. Very open layout and friendly staff. Sometimes parking can be difficult though as it is a small shared lot.$LABEL$5
This is a great comic shop. It is family friendly and usually has some kind of event going on every so many months. They are very loyal to their customers and provide a wide variety of comics to choose from. If you have any questions they're happy to help and if you're looking for suggestions they usually have a good one! The only drawback is the parking; because of it's popularity it gets a little crowded.$LABEL$5
Great spot to get a basic sub - they pile the meat extra high and the service is always friendly.  A regular sub is 7\""and is enough for two meals for me - they also have giant 14\"" subs and mini 3.5\"" subs. You can get your sub 'Mike's Way' which is the way I like it (oil$LABEL$3
I like that they grill up the vegetables here for their veggie subs.  I thought the green peppers were scrumptious and the cheese was stacked high.  There really isn't any out of the ordinary here$LABEL$4
The guy that helped me was very nice. However for $7 I expect more out of my sandwich. I had the tuna salad$LABEL$3
After driving by everyday for months I finally stopped in for a sub and was completely unimpressed. Even though the shop was nearly empty$LABEL$1
Just got a club sub and there was no lettuce$LABEL$2
Walid did a great job tailoring a custom Brooks Brothers jacket (retail $800+) that I found at the factory story ($40).  For $40$LABEL$5
Wali is a master tailor and does fantastic work altering jackets$LABEL$5
I've just had one alteration job done here -- three pairs of pants shortened$LABEL$4
After a visit to another tailor had me fearing for the fate of my gala gown$LABEL$5
I drove past this gem of a stop about 3 times until I finally found it!  It's tucked in the back of King's Court Shopping Plaza off Kings Dr.  When I got there I told Wally that I had read great reviews about his tailoring skills and he proved me right!  I brought him 4 dress that I've had for years and I wanted to alter them.  He gave me the best suggestions for each one of my dresses after really listening to what I wanted.  I loved his customer service skills so much that I had my husband bring his shirts in two days after I went to see Wally!  Life is great when you have found a fantastic tailor!  Note$LABEL$5
Walid is AMAZING!!!  On a Saturday night a week before my best friends wedding I tried on my bridesmaid dress and it was too tight in the chest area.  Although it was wearable$LABEL$5
I have used Myers Park Tailors multiple times over the last few years and have always been very pleased. Most recently$LABEL$5
I went here to get my prom dress altered. After trying it on$LABEL$5
Good place! I chose this  place after reading the reviews online. I felt safe taking my suit into this place. Walid was professional and provided good customer service.I got my suit altered for an interview in just two days (granted I had only couple of minor alternations). But he delivered the suit a day before he promised. What I liked was I got a text message from these guys as soon as my suit was ready. Place was busy but Walid still catered enough time to each customer.services I got done: shortening pants and shortening sleeves (total $40)I'll definitely choose this place again.$LABEL$5
The place is a dump.  The service is frequently spotty.  The food is STELLAR!$LABEL$4
Meskerem is to Red Sea as Harris Teeter is to Food Lion. As in$LABEL$4
I think that the food at Red Sea is fantastic.  The portions are large$LABEL$3
Large portions and delicious food$LABEL$4
Tried to have dimmer here. 5:12 and still closed. No note or sign for explanation.  Unfortunate because I would have enjoyed trying it!$LABEL$1
Ahhh. That is the sigh of satisfaction I felt as I walked out of Red Sea. It made me happy to find decent Ethiopian food in Charlotte$LABEL$4
This is good Ethiopean/Eritrean food. Lots of flavor. I went with one of the combos and was overall satisfied with the taste and serving size. The cubed meat was undercooked in my opinion . . . too tough and chewy. I especially enjoyed the spicy lentils. I am tempted to take a star away for service. It was pretty much a one man operation. When we arrived it took a long time for him to even take our order because he was on a personal call. The tables had not been cleared or cleaned. For that reason alone$LABEL$3
Apparently they don't do Ethiopian mood music on Tuesday night. Instead they play infomercials for 20 minutes and then flip through the channels for the remainder of the meal$LABEL$3
Definitely worth a try.  The food is served on and with a special bread (injerra??) that you basically use as a fork. It's similar to a pancake or crepe so it's absorbs a the juices and favors of the different meats that you choose. It is served family-style on a big dish in the center of the table for everyone to pick at.  Definitely different$LABEL$4
Update -- went back here and got the lamb (#2 I think) and it was just okay...stick to the vegetarian sampler platter.$LABEL$3
Yesterday was my second dine at Red Sea (my first was about four years ago) since I have eaten at three other Ethiopian Restaurants and one of them several times...Chicken!!!  Best Ethiopian Meat Dish I have eaten so far!  Spicy and FULL of Flavor!  Perfectly Prepared!!!!  Biggest difference must be the blend and volume of seasonings used!!! Most Unique Timatim and Spiciest though my least favorite of all the ones I have eaten... I do not think it is on the menu...Also they prepared it with no Injera \""in\"" the Timatim by our request!Injera was very good for Injera... Funny every time I eat this bread I like it more!Lentils$LABEL$4
A friend introduced me to this restaurant and I loved it. At first glance it does look a bit uninviting but trust me the service is friendly and the food is AMAZING! Wear your fat pants because the servings are huge and you will want to eat it all. Great options for vegetarians!$LABEL$4
I ordered a pizza at 10:25$LABEL$1
This is not a review about Papa Johns in general.  I love their pizza.  This is a review of their store.Terrible!  Terrible and incredibly rude staff$LABEL$1
Quick delivery and cannot stress enough to register for email deals because i never pay full price.  Savings up to 50% off regular price!$LABEL$4
Yes$LABEL$4
Worst experience with Papa Johns ever with this location. Every* time I've ordered delivery it has been incredibly late. This past time was the worst. An order estimated at 30 minutes still wasn't here 1.5 hours later so I called and they claimed it had just left. They called up from the call box once and then left within seconds. (For whatever reason it went straight to voicemail$LABEL$1
I received sub par service. My friend got cut off  and rudely spoken to while we were trying to order. All we wanted was a pizza and we have been put on hold for way too long. Don't know what to do.....$LABEL$1
I really only go to Showmars for the pitas$LABEL$3
I really$LABEL$2
This was the first time I'd tried breakfast at Showmars.  Not sure how many of them are serving breakfast.  It might just be this location because of where they are located.I definitely agree that Showmars may have been better when they are smaller - what are they up to now$LABEL$3
Decent service...horrible food. I can't for the life of me understand how this company is so successful. It could only be worse if it was yet another failed Greek attempt at Italian.$LABEL$1
I can't believe I haven't written a review for here! This is my weekend breakfast joint. And it's a solid one. My fav: $4.99 Country Breakfast (2 eggs$LABEL$4
I'm feeling a little inspired since I've been up all night listening to Slug (from Atmosphere)$LABEL$4
So$LABEL$2
While Cherry House might not have the most exquisite Chinese food ever$LABEL$3
I must have gone and dined at the restaurant twice with the food being off. Tonight$LABEL$3
Pretty cheap$LABEL$3
General tsao's chicken for take-out lunch broke the plastic fork I was using.  I probably caught them on an off-day.$LABEL$2
Drunk and need Chinese?  Stumbling out of the P-Stone (Philosopher's Stone) or Jackalope Jacks (JJ's)? HoHo Cherry house is here for you while you wait on a cab.  That said$LABEL$3
I don't generally like to review restaurants that I've only eaten at once since that hardly seems fair to me$LABEL$2
What happened to this place? I ordered my usual extra crispy sesame chicken and mushy yuckyness with  bland yet sweet syrupy sauce is what I received. I was given no choice between fried rice and white rice and they automatically assumed I wanted the large portion when I actually would have wanted the small if I knew I had the option ( I just thought the prices went up...and truthfully there was no difference in size and it use to be $6.95 now its $10.95!). I have gone to other restaurants and ordered $10 worth of Chinese take-out and received an egg roll and soup too- not the case here...although before it use to be- new management ?..or are they just getting cheap? The usually amazing   crab rangoon wasn't hot enough (temp-wise) and I was totally disappointed.They also forgot to give me my chop sticks which may be a small thing but I specifically asked for them. The literally gave us a full pint of duck sauce though so perhaps they should think of scaling down there and throwing in a veggie egg roll like they use to.  They use to have 5 stars from me but this last time wasn't even worth a single star in my opinion so  I'll meet somewhere in the middle and give them a 2.5 ...I really am not sure if I would return if the quality has gone that downhill...search is back on for good take-out Americanized Chinese food in Charlotte$LABEL$2
I was actually pleasantly surprise by my visit to the Cherry House. After reading the reviews here$LABEL$4
My boyfriend and I have been to Ho Ho Cherry House a couple times because its right up the street from our house. On a recent visit to pick up our order$LABEL$1
The Cherry House is a solid choice for affordable Chinese take out. You get large portions of yummy food and the quality is always A-OK. They have a pretty good sized menu. I'm a fan of their szechuan bean curd. It' great when I need a quick meal.There are a good bit of seat's inside$LABEL$3
I've only ordered take out lunch from here$LABEL$3
Not good Chinese food.$LABEL$2
Cherry House is good for two things: quick and inexpensive Chinese food. Don't expect to be blown aware by culinary complexity or innovative dishes and presentations here. But$LABEL$2
This was my go to Chinese place in Charlotte.  As others have said$LABEL$3
Nothing special but OHHH SOOO CHEAPP!!! Also$LABEL$4
Good cheap Chinese food. Close to home$LABEL$3
My cookie had no fortune.$LABEL$1
Great food here. They are fast and give you a good portion of food. The general tso chicken is awesome!$LABEL$5
I live around the corner from Ho Ho and order takeout close to once per week.  They always have a lunch/dinner combo special that changes weekly.  It's a great value at $6 total after tax.  This it's the best Chinese$LABEL$3
HOHO CHERRY HOUSE$LABEL$4
Very good! Nice service and clean restaurant. Good food as well. Sesame chicken was great!$LABEL$5
The food is always great.  It doesn't matter what you order$LABEL$4
Is it the best? No way. Is it the worst? Heck no. I think A-OK is a spot on description of the Cherry House.Most important thing: you can place orders online. I really hate to order over the phone$LABEL$3
I was taking a break from work one day and saw a sign in the window of this store claiming that they had some pretty great ice cream.  Being from northwest Iowa originally I know good ice cream$LABEL$3
On a unseasonably warm February evening$LABEL$2
Delicious burgers$LABEL$5
Tell me it isn't so?!?!?!?!?  I heard this place just sold out to Phat Burrito????  Can anyone confirm?  I've been dying to try it - I have two co-workers who claim this is the best lunch spot in all of Charlotte.  Build your own burgers are the way to any man's heart.Bummer.$LABEL$4
Yes$LABEL$4
My dad was a bouncer here in the 70's and my first visit was with the old man. I couldn't imagine any better venue in Charlotte. They even had a live band on Christmas night the last time I was in town. Can't say enough$LABEL$5
No better place to listen to live music in Charlotte than the DDI...a historic and very intimate venue recognized as the \""Oldest Live Music Venue East of the Mississippi\"" and holds the title \""Oldest Blues Club In The U.S. Under Original Ownership\"".  Legendary performers like Eric Clapton$LABEL$5
Double Door Inn brings the non mainstream acts & it's a delightful experience.  I went to a Foreign Exchange show here 2 years ago & was really impressed with the sound system.It's \""dive-y\"" looking inside$LABEL$3
I'm torn. The entertainment (Lizzy Ross Band) was phenomenal. I mean$LABEL$2
This a cool place to catch a smaller or local band.  There's always a cheap cover and cheap drinks.  You can't beat that.  They also have an area in the back that has pool & foosball.  What a great idea for set break!The venue is actually an old house$LABEL$4
This place gets great music here and there are many famous musicians that have played here at this \""legendary blues club\"".  It is great to see pictures of all of the famous people that have played here.  The issue that the Double Door Inn has is room.  Now if you are at the DDI and there is a light crowd it's great$LABEL$3
Double Door Inn has it all in terms of music variety. They play samplings from about every genre out there to sampled. Sometimes they've got the upbeat rock bands$LABEL$3
Hate when people vent on here about bad experiences$LABEL$2
Excellent venue. One of the best in Charlotte. It is old. You feel history. It is intimate. The only reason I'm not giving it 5 stars- it is inconsistent with their band bookings. Sometimes it is really good and other times it is \""meh\"". They definitely don't seem to pick up on traveling indy bands (they seem to go to other venues in Charlotte instead)$LABEL$4
While moving to Charlotte I stayed here a couple of nights to get are perspective of a more residential area.  It is an old house on Morehead in Dilworth that was converted to a bed & breakfast.  The interior is definitely what you would expect of a B&B - I felt like I was at my great grandmother's house.  I was slightly creeped out because I stayed there during the week and was one of two people there.  Kind of like the Shining.  Anyway$LABEL$3
If you need a place for a company get together$LABEL$5
My experience with Morehead Inn was by far the biggest disappointments I endured as a bride. I do not want another couple to have to go through what we went through with them. MHI was recommended by my wedding Planner$LABEL$1
This was one of the vendors that came highly recommended by my wedding Planner. She could not stress enough how great and accommodating they were. From our first meeting with their Event Coordinator$LABEL$1
Gorgeous- immaculate historic estate- very spacious stay in the Mt Vernon room. Wonderful breakfast- great friendly staff!$LABEL$5
The only reason I'll even give SECU two stars is that I did end up with a pretty decent mortgage for my house here$LABEL$2
I love the girls at this particular location$LABEL$3
Chinese food that delivers in Dowtown Charlotte and is decent. Of course nothing compared to San Francisco but for Charlotte a good value. Tangerine Chicken was really good$LABEL$3
Best Chinese in town. Quick delivery$LABEL$5
Very good$LABEL$4
I've been ordering stuff from them since I moved here from San Francisco$LABEL$5
The Good: Great food! I got the combo Sesame Chicken which was amazing$LABEL$3
By far my favorite Chinese food!  Usually get take out from here--I love their fried dumplings and chicken and broccoli.  Convenient location across from CPCC's IT building.  Sometimes parking is kind of an issue during busy periods$LABEL$5
Pretty darn good!Fast delivery (took way less than 45-50 min) although I will say ordering was a bit of a process due to some language barriers (on both ends). TheSesame chicken was fairly crispy as requested and the sauce was not sickeningly sweet thankfully and had a nice flavor! For $8 combo with rice and choice of spring roll or egg roll it was a pretty cheap dinner. The crab rangoon were delicious and perhaps my favorite part of the meal. Not sure what was up with the fried rice without egg or veggies or anything ...I'm not sure if it is a Charlotte thing but the last two places I've gone have been like this. I also wasn't a huge fan of their egg-rolls - since I prefer mine with a little more flavor. I will give it another shot because I thought the chicken sauce was one of the best I've had in a long time.$LABEL$3
Hot$LABEL$4
Very good delicious . Nice service fresh ingredients. Fair price. Good portions.Downtown Dan$LABEL$4
My family and I ordered take out from here regularly and loved them. However$LABEL$1
Some of the worst Chinese take out I've had in a long time.  I got the sesame chicken dinner combo. The chicken was overly breaded and very soggy.  The sesame sauce was bright red - as if they put the wrong sauce on my chicken and just threw some sesame seeds on top to make it look correct. I also had asked for brown rice$LABEL$2
This is my go-to Chinese takeout joint.  I live around the corner from Ho-Ho Cherry House in Elizabeth$LABEL$4
Well what is to be said about this place$LABEL$2
I have never been to the restaurant$LABEL$4
I can't comment on the food (you'll read why) but the process of ordering online is horrible.  We placed an order online$LABEL$1
I have ordered take out twice in the past 6 weeks from this place.Everything was consistent even the second time around.I have ordered beef & broccoli$LABEL$4
The lo mein is so bad. It was spongey and tasted like plastic. The sweet and sour chicken is just fine. It is what I expect from a chinese take out place. (You can sit in) I probably won't be going to this place unless I have limited options approaching 10:00pm. This place could make a killing if it stayed open till 12am-2am on weekends.$LABEL$2
The food was okay! It's great for what they were charging. I wish they weren't located in such an awkward place though. Due to a road being shut down for construction in Charlotte it was kind of hard to get to it.The rice they gave us with the chicken/cashew and the beef/broccoli combinations weren't good at all$LABEL$3
Their prices are reasonable & they deliver. Also the delivery service was quite fast. The food was where things started declining. The spring roll was fine$LABEL$2
I absolutely love this place!  I am a huge fan of their quick fast and efficient delivery service.  I usually run the Sesame Chicken with fried rice.  Because there is a delivery minimum$LABEL$4
Alot of food$LABEL$4
The food was amazing and the service was the same. Nice spot if you are downtown looking for awesome fried rice. I will be back there again real soon.$LABEL$4
Extremely poor customer service and do not offer the latest innovations in wigs. Maybe they were once the only game in town and are resting on their laurels...if you have breast cancer$LABEL$1
Very pushy! I went with my mother who is fighting cancer$LABEL$1
I'm really ambivalent about this place. On one hand$LABEL$3
I attended a business dinner at Carpe Diem last night and found it to be a nice little gem tucked into an interesting part of town.  The area is undergoing some extensive construction - 1/2 the street was shut down outside the restaurant - so getting there was a bit of a challenge.And while the decor seemed somewhat outdated (and the chairs were about the most uncomfortable I've experienced)$LABEL$4
Worth checking out.  The food was good and the scene is relaxed.$LABEL$4
I had dinner at Carpe Diem with a good friend on a recent Tuesday evening.  The company was excellent$LABEL$2
I think there is a lot better food to be had in Charlotte. This place definitely has a romantic vibe going; its just that the food is not that good. Wasn't memorable$LABEL$2
I discovered this place 2 yrs ago during 3 coures for 30.  Every time i go i have to have the either the Grilled grape salad$LABEL$5
On a recent visit I had the duck which was tender enough to cut with a fork and extremely well flavored. The spinach and parmasean soup was out of this world! A fanastic find and very enjoyable atmoshpere. Resonably priced wine and good service make this a \""I'll be back\"" restaurant.$LABEL$5
Very much enjoyed my dinner at Carpe Diem. I had a tasty scallop dish albeit a bit small portion wise and two delicious starters - the tuna and calamari. I was happy in the end that I did get appetizers or my meal might have been a bit small. The real stand out was the fresh bread- wow delicious..I literally couldn't stop reaching for another roll - even after I was full! Our server was friendly and attentive- he recommended a nice chardonnay for my dinner and was pleasantly surprised it was in the $8 range.The atmosphere was a little stark- nicer for a quiet date than a girls night. Overall id say bring your wallet- my meal with two drinks and an appetizer was about $60. I would absolutely visit again since everything was really yummy!$LABEL$4
Went here for restaurant week and enjoyed the 9 oz pork while my date had the Salmon. Both plates were prepared deliciously and the hot rolls they bring you are just delicious. The service was as expected of a higher end joint and the tables were cleared immediately after courses were completed. I was very satisfied with my experience here.$LABEL$4
We mentioned Yelp but did not get 10% off our ticket.  Our waitress had never heard of Yelp.  Anyhoo$LABEL$4
WOW!  This has got to be the best experience I've had dining in Charlotte.  From the service$LABEL$5
Nice place but the food isn't consistant. :( too bad because its a really nice place to have our date nights.$LABEL$4
Here for Queen's Feast this past week and it was a sound choice I must say.  From the very beginning you can tell this is a great date night spot and my girlfriend and I were given a nice little two person table to help complete that scenario perfectly.The food wasn't short of fantastic.  It was expertly prepared and plated very nicely upon presentation.  I was pretty impressed with all things$LABEL$4
We went to Carpe Diem recently while visiting my family in Charlotte. We were really excited to eat here based on all the great things Yelpers had to say. The d\u00e9cor was nice$LABEL$3
My wife and I went there for the first time. My review will be kind of mixed so just hear it out first. We made reservations and when we got there they were right on top of things taking our jackets and had the table ready. What was kind of a downfall was it literally took us 20 mins just to place an order for drinks so with all that time we just went ahead and placed our orders as well. The bread and butter was pretty good. Our appetizer was the beef carpaccio$LABEL$3
Went here last night with my parents and while the whole meal was delicious$LABEL$4
I made a reservation online though open table$LABEL$5
went here while in town visiting family. I had the meza plate with hummus$LABEL$3
We used Carpe Diem to cater our wedding$LABEL$5
Great service and a nice but relaxed space.  The food was creative and interesting.  I tried the salmon special$LABEL$4
I had high hopes for this place. Maybe it was because it was restaurant week$LABEL$2
Had the salad special$LABEL$4
Excellent spot in great area! The Food was very good and the prices were moderate. Service was good as well. Try to Fried Chicken Breast entree$LABEL$4
Beautiful interior$LABEL$5
Recently took my fianc\u00e9 here for our anniversary. She is always skeptical about spending the money for a nice meal$LABEL$5
Beautiful!  Romantic!  GREAT Service!  Fantastic FOOD!  Impress a Date or Client!  Funny$LABEL$5
Authentic New Orleans flavor and great family atmosphere.  Not pricey$LABEL$5
We've been to the Pineville location before$LABEL$2
Skip this one.$LABEL$1
I wasn't quite sure what to expect from this place.  Seeing some of the patrons walking into this place dressed up and at the same time seeing a giant alligator statue sitting in a throne in the front yard.  Once inside it's actually a really nice place.  The service is great$LABEL$4
I agree with Lindsey R. that this area of 7th Street has some of Charlotte's cutest restaurants. Fig Tree$LABEL$4
3 people sat down...Interesting old house feel to the place. #1 - Etouffee shrimp - good shrimp$LABEL$2
A litle more upscale Cajun joint$LABEL$3
We came here for Sunday Brunch at around 11:45am.  The ambience  inside and outside is cool.  Nice place to go to drink eat and chat with a friends.~Service was just ok.  waiter seemed bothered...maybe he had a hard night.  (We will try the Pineville location next time....lol)-Fried Green Tomatoes were delicious (will order again)-Eggs Benedict on Crab Cakes was very tasty. (will order again)-Key Lime Pie was good but its more of a white cream mouse filling style than a yellow custard filling style. ( I prefer the custard style).$LABEL$3
Was recommended to this restaurant by the front  desk clerk at the Hilton nearby. My two co-workers and I were very happy with the food and the service. Portion sizes were more than enough. I ordered the Blackened Filet Diane and added shrimp. One of my co-workers had the shrimp$LABEL$4
I was looking forward to dining at the Cajun Queen from hearing about their authentic New Orleans cuisine to seeing their Best Cajun Restaurant in Charlotte status. It wasn't horrible but it wasn't memorable. I wish I could write about the service or the exact taste of the food but it was simply meh. I got the Blackened Catfish Filet with mashed taters (which I do remember and were fabulous) but I think they forgot the blackening on it or don't know what blackening means. I had to put some hot sauce on there just to get a kick.It's a charming place however they had some live music which I personally found loud (and this moment right here is when I turned old).If you're looking for authentic New Orleans style food like I was$LABEL$2
havent been there since i was a kid with my parents and after last night i will not go back. who's ever heard of bland cajun food$LABEL$2
Went here for my wife's birthday.Made a reservation arrived early and was seated after waiting 30 minutes after the reservation had passed. We came for the Jazz but wound up sitting in a room with no band and canned music.The food was ok - and if we'd been seated earlier and able to actually hear the music I would give this place a 4 star review.$LABEL$3
Came here for my wife's birthday one year - had great food and the live jazz is a great plus.$LABEL$4
If you like your appetizers before your drinks....this is your place. Table had empty salt and pepper shakers. The hot sauce bottles were empty and dirty. This is NOT authentic Cajun food! The Champagne was flat.....horrible experience. Waiter was aloof.$LABEL$2
Wanted to give this place 3 stars$LABEL$2
BBQ shrimp...Fried oysters...RBR...All brilliant.$LABEL$5
We had our first visit last night. Fun$LABEL$5
Elizabeth is one of my favorite parts of town; I love how old houses have been remade into restaurants and offices.  Too often charming old buildings are paved over and replaces with concrete boxes.  The Cajun Queen is in one of these old homes$LABEL$4
I've been to Cajun Queen a couple times$LABEL$4
I was checking my photo's only to find out that I have not made a review of this place. Me and Mine went here a few weeks ago for Brunch. She had the shrimp & gritsI had had the gumbo.. Everything was nice and neat$LABEL$4
We came to eat to celebrate our anniversary (this as one of our first dates 14 years ago).  I called over a month ago to make the reservation and explained the purpose of our visit and asked if they could do anything for us when we came.  We arrived that night and were seated quickly.  Very crowded$LABEL$2
This place is great! The setting is wonderful-- the restaurant is in a nice$LABEL$4
Maybe it's because I've been to New Orleans or have friends from Louisiana but I don't know what the big to do about Cajun Queen is.  Maybe it's because people have never had real Cajun cuisine before.The fried green tomatoes were blah.  The batter wasn't tasty at all.  My entree was the combo etouffee with shrimp$LABEL$2
I had a great dinner here tonight! My party dined on the fried pickle chips$LABEL$4
So earlier this year I bought a coupon off of Google Offers for Cajun Queen. I had never been here and wanted to try it so $15 for $40 worth of food was a great incentive. It took me until last week to give it a try. The atmosphere was dark and a bit drab. The art on the walls was nice but I was here for food. The menu was concise but could have been a bit more extensive. The prices were on the high side of expensive. Thank goodness for the coupon. Service was prompt but about as drab as the atmosphere. I could have used a smile from someone but it didn't come. The portions that came with my meal were just the way I like them. Not too much but enough for a good dinner. The flavor of the oysters and shrimp was above satisfactory. All in all$LABEL$2
I was quite excited to finally come here after purchasing the Google Offer$LABEL$3
I've been to New Orleans many times and have experienced some great Cajun style food$LABEL$3
Lovely atmosphere$LABEL$5
After waiting and waiting this week me and my spouse finally went to cajun queen and in my opinion it was just ok. We had the barbque shrimp which was ok fresh shrimp in a spicy sauce. My boo did save his dinner rolls for the juice. He had the fried shrimp which was good i had a steak which was ok with potatoes that were ok and bland broccoli. I alsohad gumbo which was not very good. Overall it was ok but for 80 i have had better$LABEL$3
We took our daughter there for her birthday a while ago$LABEL$2
Went during the restaurant week and wasn't disappointed. I had the shrimp and grits with andouille sausage and a small bowl of gumbo.  The gumbo was a little hot (seasoning hot) but not too much.  The Shrimp & Grits were excellent as well.  The live jazz by the 3 senior citizens was excellent as well.  Overall everything was great and we'll go back again.$LABEL$4
Food was very good! Certainly not a creole expert$LABEL$4
I do not understand the hype about this place. Everything is incredibly overpriced and the food is less than mediocre. I did enjoy the bbq shrimp app but the entrees were miserable. I got the shrimp Diane which I'm pretty sure was just shrimp$LABEL$2
Food was bangin. I got the sirloin special with mashed potatoes and etoufee with just the right amount of kick. We requested to sit upstairs thinking we would have a nice date with some soft jazz in the background. Oh man was I wrong. The music$LABEL$4
Eh. I came in with high hopes for Cajun Queen after being somewhat disappointed with other cajun places in Charlotte. It was ok$LABEL$3
This is a place that has earned my business for a long time to come after just one visit.  I will be back next time I pass through Charlotte.  Two friends had recommended this place for a business dinner and it did not disappoint.I brought a potential client here for a laid back$LABEL$5
My boyfriend and I ate at Cajun Queen last Friday night . We had 7:30 dinner reservations. We pulled up and they had a valet service - nice touch! Parking can be very difficult over there. We were seated immediately at a very nice table next to a window. I ordered the Diane and my boyfriend got the Etouffe. Both were very good! My only complaint was$LABEL$3
Good food usually very consistent....Great bbq shrimp. Seating can be tight.$LABEL$4
Service is good. Gumbo was a bit watery and a pinch of salt wouldn't have hurt. Gumbo was fresh. The same tomatoe soupy water they use in the gumbo they also add to my shrimp and grits. Shrimp and andoui sausage  was good but grits its self were under seasoned i.e pinch of salt.$LABEL$2
Popped in here for a dinner date with the girlfriend a few days ago.  I was tasked with picking a place we haven't tried and this place came to mind.  In addition to that I actually had a coupon which actually sweetened the deal even more.We got there and headed upstairs to the bar to give our appetites a chance to ramp up.  The bar is small but doable and the furnishings are a little dated looking.  Not sure if that's the look they are going for but it is what it is.  Not horrible$LABEL$3
Oh yeah.  I was there in the late 90s and loved it. My first trip back to Charlotte in 15 years and this place was my first stop. Excellent meal$LABEL$4
My first time eating here will more than likely be my last. Im big on customer service and i did not like the fact that when i got up to go use the rest room i returned just to have the rest of my food thrown away and after i asked the manager if i could get 5 shrimp like i had he said sorry my food got thrown away but it would be $2 per shrimp if i wanted more. I had just spent $30 there and that was totally wrong$LABEL$2
Me and my friend went here for her birthday weekend and it was great. I was a little hesitant because I'm not real big on spicy/cajun food$LABEL$4
We were in town for my job this past weekend and decided we were in the mood for Cajun food.  This place is in a super cute purple house in a neighborhood.  The place was packed and I was so glad I had a reservation!  We got there around 7:15 and people kept coming after us.TIP: there is complementary valet parking so bring some cash so you can tip these guys on the way out.I started with a Bell's Two Hearted from a nice little beer menu.  At only $4 a bottle this is a great value.  Then we split an appetizer of fried green tomatoes.  I was so glad we decide to split since it was 5 very thick slices of tomato breaded and fried.  The presentation could've been a bit better - they were placed on a bed of greens$LABEL$3
I love Cajun Queen!! I have been here several times and I will continue to go for the ambience$LABEL$4
Mmmm-mmm! I definitely picked the right place for my birthday dinner. We showed up slightly early and got to mingle in the bar for a few minutes- what a fun bar! I'm going to have to go back just for that alone. Then we were seated in the downstairs porch/sun room$LABEL$5
My fiance and I went to Cajun Queen one night as a date night.  I was not impressed by the food nor the ambiance.  We booked a late night dinner due to his schedule  and when we arrived$LABEL$2
Date night!  And where shall we go?  Cajun Queen of course.  This restaurant is located in a beautiful$LABEL$4
This is a cool place in a historic home in Elizabeth.  We loved the appetizers and atmosphere (five stars for those)$LABEL$3
They Lack favor in their food. I ordered the gumbo it lacked favor and good ingredients. it was not good. The popcorn crawfish were so delicious but covered in a mayo based sauce that should be served on the side. I didn't like seeing the stations for busing dishes right as you got to the top of stairs. It has potential but think the chef needs to take a hard look at his food. I want to love this place but the food is not executed well at this time.$LABEL$2
I would absolutely recommend anyone wanting to visit to make prior reservations. It's an intimate environment set up in a converted home.  We ordered appetizers consisting of cajun popcorn((crawfish tails)$LABEL$4
Visiting Charlotte from Los Angeles while husband is in town for business. The good: The upstairs dining room has a live band and lively atmosphere. People are talking loud and enjoying themselves. Have a drink before your dinner comes for an even better time. We each had a glass of wine. The sauce from the barbeque shrimp was the best part of our meal. Not the shrimp$LABEL$1
I found a living social deal $20 for $40. Cajun food is a personal favorite of mine$LABEL$4
VERY rarely do my boyfriend and I leave dinner completely satisfied$LABEL$5
The food$LABEL$4
So incredibly let down by this dining experience. Our waiter was simultaneously overbearing and absent-minded. Half of our table got their meals 10-15 mins before the other half and the waiter forgot to bring two of us our desserts. Meanwhile$LABEL$1
I went to cajun queen with some friends from work a while back. I had the Diane$LABEL$3
Let me start off by saying$LABEL$3
So about 10 years ago I was taken to Cajun Queen by some friends when I moved here to Charlotte from Chicago. Remembering that I was not crazy about it$LABEL$2
Do not waste your money! The gumbo tasted like the roux had burned and there was no salt whatsoever. I ordered the blackened chicken to be safe thinking \""no one can mess up blackened chicken\"".....I was wrong. None of the food (including the blackened chicken) were seasoned with salt and pepper. This was the most bland$LABEL$1
Excellent food the price is comparable especially on the creole dishes. You have to make reservations if you want to get a good seat otherwise come before six o'clock.$LABEL$5
I'd probably give 3 1/2 if I could but I'm going to give 4 stars for excellent service... love the live music every night$LABEL$4
Although I have passed this location on many trips to  Charlotte as well as when I lived her$LABEL$5
I take everyone that comes to visit me to Cajun Queen!  From the great food (my favorite is the bbq shrimp and bread to dip into the sauce)$LABEL$1
I've been to Cajun Queen a few times now and I've been extremely satisfied with both the high level of customer service and also the food quality.  First$LABEL$4
Great atmosphere$LABEL$5
We had heard a lot about this place and decided to dine in here during the Charlotte Restaurant Week. We have been to this place only once so far. Just to be safe we made reservations. I will say this place has a beautiful ambiance. It looks like a house which is converted to a beautiful restaurant. There is valet parking available. The receptionist at the front gave us a nice seat on the second floor. It was just our luck because there was live jazz music being played that night. During the restaurant week$LABEL$4
DISABLED PEOPLE$LABEL$1
We went there$LABEL$3
Very loud$LABEL$1
The owner could care less about customers. He is the rudest man. The food is so so. Nothing Cajun about it. They did not use our Groupon correctly. That was fine with us$LABEL$1
NOTE: Unlike BOA$LABEL$1
Opened up a new account at this branch. Had to wait a few minutes$LABEL$4
I agree w/  a previous yelper who says this place is not really a bargain. It's definitely a solid 4 stars on the food itself$LABEL$3
Area kinda shady...but best fried chicken in the city by far. Great prices also$LABEL$4
I looooovvvvvvee this place.  When you step into the door you might as well loosen your belt a notch or two$LABEL$5
I'm going to need the Chicken Box to step it up a notch.  My last couple of visits were just ok$LABEL$3
best fried chicken in charlotte.$LABEL$5
Oh Chicken Box$LABEL$5
I drove by this place so many times not thinking much about it$LABEL$5
I've definitely had hit or miss days from Chicken Box$LABEL$4
If you were in NoDa$LABEL$5
This is where it's at.  The best soul food in town.  Prices really cater to working class folks.  I love the food and service.  Family oriented and great atmosphere.$LABEL$5
Closest to mom and granma's cookin from back in MY day i've had in the city since i've been in Charlotte$LABEL$5
Have you ever heard the term$LABEL$5
Having a taste for some soul food and reading the previous reviews$LABEL$2
This place hits the spot on a Sunday afternoon! Like the previous reviews have mentioned if you're looking for hot$LABEL$4
This place is so good!!  The fried chicken is juicy but not greasy.  The Mac and Cheese was baked and on point.  And the collards was delicious.  And they give you a big plate.  It was definitely sleepy time when I was finished my food.Also$LABEL$4
One of the first things my son ever read out loud was the sign outside of Chicken Box. He wanted to eat there$LABEL$5
Price's beats this by a mile.I wanted to love this place - I wanted to not have to huddle in my car after carrying Price's magical white box down the street like I stole it. I wanted to sit down and eat$LABEL$3
Greasy overpriced food. Mac and cheese boring$LABEL$2
I stopped by the Chicken Box to grab lunch today.  I hadn't been there for a long time$LABEL$1
This is no longer The Chicken Box Cafe.  Old owners or new owners$LABEL$1
The original owners are back with the OLD name Chicken Box$LABEL$2
I came here on my lunch break at work$LABEL$2
I ordered a takeout here today and ordered my FF extra crispy.  Same old limp soggy under cooked fries as usual.$LABEL$3
Do you feel like these places typically rake you over the coals?!  Look no further!  I am grateful my friend originally referred me to BWP.  They are honest$LABEL$5
Body Works Plus on Parkwood Dr in Charlotte is the best car body repair. We have used them for a couple of repair jobs and they have always given great service in a timely fashion at a fair price. We wouldn't go anywhere else and highly recommend them. You can follow your car's repair progress on their website to stay informed. This is great customer service.$LABEL$5
This place is the ONLY place in CLT for quality body work!.. Great work ethic$LABEL$5
Nobody wants to be doing business at a body shop for the most part but these folks make it a pleasure. You get text updates on the status of your vehicle and they work with insurance to make the process painless. Don't hesitate to get your work done here if your car gets a boo-boo$LABEL$5
I would highly recommend Body Works Plus to anyone in the Charlotte area that is in need of body work. My experience with Brian$LABEL$5
Honestly$LABEL$5
Too expensive. Go to the clears in the wells fargo buiding uptown$LABEL$1
Just witnessed a most sexist and unfair firing of a waitress in front of other customers. The owner was rude to other customers who tried to come to her aid. He said he lost a regular because she brought him the wrong tea. He lost a lot more regulars because of his public display of anger.$LABEL$1
PICKLES FARMERS MARKETThis review is for the farmer's market held at the gallery Saturdays 8am-2pm. I went to the market with about 24 dollars cash after a yoga class. I arrived a little before noon and did a walk around. The space is not terribly big and there seemed to be about fifteen or so vendors. For sale were your usual farmer's market items$LABEL$4
Good BBQ? Please......Chicago style? Well$LABEL$1
Bodrick's is neighborhood BBQ Joint with great food and packed into a small space! Great service$LABEL$5
I work in Charlotte and I like to eat at Bodricks whenever  I'm in the area at lunch time. The BBQ sandwich$LABEL$4
I just want to comment that I wrote to Urban Ministries from the volunteer page that said \""Create your own volunteer opportunity\"" and offered to go to several Room at the Inn sites every Saturday night during the winter months and set up mobile barber shops and cut as many heads as needed for my volunteer job. I was sent a rude reply asking if I was trying to make a paid opportunity. I laughed at first because I have been in the beauty/barber business for 30 years and I own a salon here. Clearly I would not troll the homeless shelters for my money making opportunities. But then I just felt sick and sad that all those men who might have needed those cuts for possible jobs$LABEL$1
All I saw was drugs dealing fights! This place is a big joke! They should shut this place down! Rooms for the inn they give you a place to sleep eat and shower and they talk about god what to know your story! Than go on to say money is bad but the people saying in jumping in to benz high dollar cars funny bullshit here it made me think of PTL telling you shut this place down!$LABEL$1
I've been here several times.I have no big complaints against this store$LABEL$3
I've been here quite a few times. (Honestly because it's very near my house) on 2 or 3 occasions$LABEL$2
Mr. Moore and his team do really great work. Nobody likes having damage to their vehicle$LABEL$5
If you're a male who loves serious go-karting$LABEL$3
I'm not an avid go-karter but I've been enough times to know what to expect.  This go-kart establishment is by far the worst that I've been to. I've been to go karting in places in LA$LABEL$2
This place is really fun!Great location$LABEL$4
Granted I don't have a need for speed$LABEL$3
I have raced at VLK a few times$LABEL$5
Recommend for DATE NIGHT or group experienceSo I am a hiking$LABEL$3
Loved it!I know NOTHING about go karting$LABEL$5
I must say I am very disappointed with the way it's establishment is ran$LABEL$1
Meh. Came here again on a busy Saturday night around 8pm. Maybe since I had such an amazing first experience my expectations were too high. Customer service was seriously lacking. The front desk girl was a little standoffish. I Just didn't feel welcomed. There was a mother with 3 kids that came in after me that was visiting for the first time asking general questions about signing up$LABEL$2
Came in for a private party and had a blast! They let us girls do our own round$LABEL$4
Small station.  Outdated for the volume of traffic handled.     But a nice gentleman volunteer opens the door for you.$LABEL$2
Not my favorite Amtrak location.  It's kinda dingy and in a not so nice location.  I will continue to use this station as it's the only one in Charlotte.... but it's nothing to write home about.$LABEL$3
Old but clean$LABEL$3
Took Amtrak from Durham to Charlotte to see the Panther/Saints game. On the return trip we were stopped by a broken down N&S freight train on the single track around High Point. We didn't move for an hour and a half. Several weeks later I took the train to see the Panthers/49ers play.  The return trip was delayed because earlier in the day the train had run over two people in Durham and Greensboro. We were supposed to leave Charlotte at 5:15. By 6:30 they couldn't tell us any status about when the train would arrive. \""Could be 8. Could be 9. It might never show up.\"" I had to spend the night in Charlotte and catch the next morning's train. On the return we were 15 mins outside of Durham when the train came to a halt. There was a sensor issue that had to be investigated. Never$LABEL$1
Replacing an unsuccessful print and framing shop on the corner of 35th and North Davidson$LABEL$4
Christian and Hayley are rockstars.  Everytime you see someone with an awesome tat in Charlotte odds are they have done it.  Their work is professional and beautiful.  I put down a deposit and was told it might cost more based on the complexity and time but it didn't cost anymore.  Very fair$LABEL$5
I LOVE THIS PLACE!!!!!!!!!!!!!Nathan Fish did an amazing job with my tattoo and I couldn't have been more pleased with it. I saw this picture online that I liked and printed it off as a basis for my tattooo. Nathan took the picture and made revisions for the specifics I wanted. The ending result was more than I expected$LABEL$5
My husband has been researching places to find an artist with whom he could have a long standing and lucrative relationship.  After checking out places on Yelp$LABEL$2
Thank you Fu Tattoo for completely ruining my husbands tattoo. What was once two initials with a heart is now one big blob. If you can't do a touch up on a customer you need to tell them. Awful. I will make sure to add a picture so everyone can see the work you clowns do.$LABEL$1
This Caterer entirely ruined my sisters wedding yesterday.  For a small 50 person wedding$LABEL$1
This place is like something out of a cowboy movie.  The place looks like an old frontier home and has a rustic feel.  And the menu only adds to the manly atmosphere$LABEL$3
I honestly can't remember why I stopped by here$LABEL$4
i agree w/the last reviewer$LABEL$3
Excellent service.  Cocktail Sauce will clear the sinuses.   Steaks were cooked correctly but not up to par with the past.  Ordered a rib-eye$LABEL$3
JUNE 2011 - NOW CLOSED.I just read in today's Observer that the Ranch House is now closed - the owners are trying to find a buyer for it. Sad to lose another Charlotte Institution! This place holds a lot of memories for a a lot of people. (For me$LABEL$3
Old school steak house feel but a good spot to hit if you son't want to head downtown for some real grubbing!$LABEL$4
Course didn't seem well-maintained as others speak about.  Some fairways are overgrown with weed-like plants and perhaps$LABEL$3
So so.  It was the smaller things that SHOUTED \""cheap & low quality\""Crappy hair dryer.  Holes burned in comforter.  Ratty toilet seat.  Stayed one night in 2 bedroom unit.  Liked the layout - 2 bedrooms - each with a bathroom.  Living room and kitchen between.$LABEL$2
The selection of food here reminds me of the menu at Showmars.  I had a fish gyro here and I was filled up$LABEL$3
Eh... It's quick$LABEL$2
Sweet tea is good as is the blue cheese dressing. They are quick and they have ample parking and seating. That counts for something. I did not care for the mashed potatoes - they tasted like instant. That's about all I can say. I'll try them again and try some different things.... Breakfast is good. I enjoyed the pancakes$LABEL$3
It's clean$LABEL$4
As someone who went to college far away from home$LABEL$4
I spent quite a few hours in this airport between flights - on the side before the security gates$LABEL$4
I've only ever connected in Charlotte$LABEL$5
I wish I could give a minus 5.  This was the most unorganized set up I've seen in a while.  We had to stop here on the way back from Mexico.  It took so long to get through Immigration and Customs$LABEL$1
Couldnt tell you a thing about this airport except that right next to our gate for our connecting flight there was a gelato place that had some pretty great flavours.  I made the mistake of getting the coffee flavour which meant that I couldnt get to sleep until about 2am the next morning.  Oh but it was worth it.$LABEL$3
\""Rocking chairs and free wireless.\""  Borrowing from David S. B. [hey it is a great opening.]  Those two things do set this airport apart from others.  The rocking chairs make me think of my grandparent's house at the lake.  They also create an appearance of things are slower here$LABEL$4
Rocking chairs don't mean much to the road weary traveler who has already been on the road$LABEL$2
Yes$LABEL$2
I really just wanted to review the USO at the Charlotte airport$LABEL$4
A very nice airport to have a layover unlike some other places I know. Very clean loo's for 1's and 2's$LABEL$4
I did not have a great experience in this airport.  I think I came in through Terminal E$LABEL$2
Clean$LABEL$3
Not bad as far as airports go$LABEL$3
Flying through this airport makes up for the fact that you're probably on USAirheads instead of United.  But hell$LABEL$3
Yeah$LABEL$2
I had a two-and-a-half-hour layover in Charlotte.  I wasn't sure what to expect$LABEL$3
Pros:Rocking Chairs everywhereA \""spa\"" where you can get a quick massage$LABEL$3
I've been flying in and out of this airport for more years than I care to think about$LABEL$4
While nothing spectacular$LABEL$3
Wine bar with monitors displaying departures.Check.Rocking chairs scattered throughout the terminals.Check.Gelato standCheck.Spa services while you wait for your flight.Check.I may just move in.$LABEL$4
Not a terrible airport....but not incredible either.The security lines are slow and tedious.  Keep in mind that there are multiple security checkpoints so don't think you need to use the one closest to your gate when the lines are long.The rocking chairs are a nice touch as well if you want to grab some Southern culture during a layover.$LABEL$3
Well I've only flown in and out of here twice while visiting family during the holidays and I always go during \""off peak\"" days in order to avoid the holiday rush.. but generally$LABEL$3
This is a very clean airport and loaded with places to eat and drink.  Plus the wireless internet was great as well$LABEL$3
yeah. that's right.  I'm yelping a layover with 4 stars. CLT knows how to do a layover right! I found myself sitting on a rocking chair in the main terminal atrium$LABEL$4
My home airport$LABEL$3
I was actually quite impressed by this airport.  Two things stood out for me:  their free wi-fi$LABEL$4
If I had to have a layover$LABEL$4
Not a bad airport.  You feel the humidity as soon as you walk off the plane.  The airport was pretty easy to get around (though it was quite busy during the day).  Also$LABEL$3
Since I travel almost exclusively with US Airways$LABEL$4
Rocking chairs in the airport?? !  An entire row of them!   What an interesting and distinguishing feature.   Also$LABEL$3
My love for this place just keeps going up!Again$LABEL$5
This is an okay airport$LABEL$3
On my first trip to Charlotte$LABEL$2
It feels kinda funny being a fan of an airport$LABEL$4
This airport is ok.  The thing is there is only one elite line$LABEL$3
When on the road and flying to many cities on the East Coast$LABEL$4
I can't stand this airport.  They put all of the feeder flights at the opposite end of the airport from the longer run flights making it a 1/2 to 3/4 mile jog.  The food court is the best part of this airport$LABEL$2
One of the better airports to transfer in from Boston to Daytona Beach. I've generally found that everyone here is friendly. The rocking chairs are a nice place to sit down and rest during a layover. Good selection of food and shopping to keep someone busy for a while.$LABEL$3
Bathrooms smell bad but there's free wifi.  Food options are ok$LABEL$3
One of my least favorite airports.  The flights I end up taking into Charlotte (e.g.$LABEL$2
Not too big$LABEL$3
I like this airport. I had a stopover from Toronto to Miami and it was very easy finding our next gate without feeling like we were making our way through a maze. The food places were pretty decent (surprised to see Manchu Wok!)$LABEL$3
the rocking chairs in the middle is pretty neat. very southern... only airport/place in the tri-state area that has jamba juice.free wifi if I remember correctly...$LABEL$5
I think its generally kind of an average airport.Pros: CHEAP parking (I'm comparing to Chicago though so...eh)$LABEL$3
I like this airport. It's small but once you get past security all gates are accessible from a central space$LABEL$3
I'm a pretty big fan of airports... I like to see how they are planned and figuring out the layout.  It's interesting to see an old airport with a bunch of additions to it and how it evolves to serve its city.Charlotte-Douglas is ok in that it is an international airport and large enough to pretty much fly anywhere.  It helps that it is a US Air hub$LABEL$3
For a \""Small\"" airport$LABEL$4
OMG this is the slowest AIRPORT i have been to in the last 12 months.I have been in to 15 different Airports in the US in the last 12 months.$LABEL$1
This is the first time I have been to this airport.  We had a layover on our way to Jamaica.  It was clean and pretty well laid out.Because of security and our desire to have control of our bags$LABEL$3
Friendly$LABEL$3
What a cluster$LABEL$2
This is actually one of my favorite airports...especially if you have a lot of time to kill between flights. There are great food options all over the airport$LABEL$4
Never checked in here so cannot comment about the security but the place is really clean and seem to have a lot of food options and i like the main food plaza.  it is very open and feels welcoming$LABEL$3
NIce little southern hospitality airport. I like the rockers they have so you can se the goings on outside. The only drawback is that southerners for the most part should watch the southern food there are way too many golf carts going up and down the halls transporting people who don't necessarily need it$LABEL$4
Charlotte-Douglas is a fairly nice$LABEL$4
It's big$LABEL$4
U.S. Airways has a major hub here and its very clean and modern$LABEL$4
This place has the best USO I have ever been to!$LABEL$5
Kinda weird to write a review of an airport$LABEL$4
Like others have mentioned$LABEL$4
This airport has rocking chairs in it which is fitting since the people here love to do things like stand on the moving sidewalk.  The moving sidewalk is not to take a little break from your day of walking.  It's to help people get to their gates faster.  Charlotte has been my connecting airport several times and I've never missed a flight.  Considering the amount of people standing around as if the rapture is about to happen - it's amazing I've never missed a flight here.  The good news is this airport is clean... and there was an attendant in the bathroom.$LABEL$3
A maze of gates$LABEL$3
If you have time to leisurely stroll to your gate$LABEL$3
This is the first time I have been compelled to review an airport but after reading in a clearly biased US Airways magazine that this airport won a best airport award. I couldn't help myself. This is the worst airport layout ever. Basically$LABEL$2
This airport was pretty cool. Until... Going through that TSA x-ray scanning and pat down! This service should have included four star dining and drinks before hand. Before I head back to the West Coast$LABEL$2
I've made stops here twice - both on connecting flights to another airport.  Charlotte is a US Airways hub$LABEL$3
I love this airport.  Small enough to get in$LABEL$4
Clean$LABEL$4
If you're connecting to a flight in the same terminal$LABEL$3
I'm wondering if it is even worthwhile for me to write a review of my home airport.  It's not like there's a better airport in town for me to fly out of.  I also doubt that the owner of Charlotte-Douglas Airport is going to read my review and send me an email apologizing for his business' poor service and terrible product like a restaurant owner would do.  Writing an airport review is as futile an effort as catching wind with a net$LABEL$2
Easy in and out$LABEL$2
Usually the security lines at the ends of the airport have fewer people. Security is slow but the airport does have Bojangles$LABEL$3
I was just here for a 95 minute layover.  Ate at the food court.  It was crowded for a Saturday!Looks like the airport could use a bit of modernization.  Free Wi-Fi!$LABEL$3
The airport itself has not much to complain about$LABEL$2
Well$LABEL$3
Charlotte-Douglas Int'l is a great airport.  Always clean and as long as you don't park in Long Term and stick to the Daily parking lots you can get to and fro from the terminals fairly quickly.  Couple things they could improve though$LABEL$3
I travel for business for 11years. I had my share of airports. CLT needs improvements in the drop off and pick up areas. Need to expand the roads.$LABEL$2
As an airport$LABEL$4
Was just stopping through on our way to Las Vegas. It was 7:00AM in the morning...the Starbucks line moved quickly...and everyone was friendly.Thats enough for at least 4 stars :)$LABEL$4
I recently flew through the Charlotte airport twice and was delayed both times$LABEL$2
As a resident of Charlotte and frequent traveller$LABEL$3
Good airport. Never had an issue in security line or anywhere else.$LABEL$4
Is it a North Carolina thing to have bathroom attendants in every men's room$LABEL$1
On a recent trip down south I got to experience CLT for the first time as a connecting passenger. I arguably saw the airport at it's best and worst during this trip$LABEL$3
Though I take far fewer flights these days than I used to in my younger years$LABEL$4
Having recently visited the Carolina's$LABEL$3
Unfortunately$LABEL$3
I like the way this airport is laid out. While you may have to walk a bit...at least it is all well marked and clean and fun to walk thru. Wish I could get one of the rockin' chairs. They always are full when I pass thru. The BBQ is really nice............Carolina Pit Barbecue. A little pricey but that is the way airports operate. The Wright Brother plane replica is nice to see as you walk toward E area. Interesting to note that the plane is higher off the ground then the real Flyer ever got!$LABEL$4
As a frequent flyer$LABEL$1
Hate hate hate flying... but being from Portland$LABEL$2
An international hub airport with that regional airport feel.  Take from that what you will.$LABEL$2
I'm not sure which is the worse nightmare. Living in Charlotte [ which unfortunately I did$LABEL$1
I like CLT. I flew through here on my way from Philadelphia (my least favorite airport) to Fort Myers$LABEL$4
Yea$LABEL$1
Actually one of the best airports I've been too. Would I go back? Hell yeah? Anytime soon? Hell no.$LABEL$4
haha when i was here tryin to fly back to LAX and also back to NJ another time my flight was delayed ...it was pourin out...it sure does rain a lot in NC!$LABEL$3
Ick. Wish I had never had to touch down here in the first place and delays dragged it out. Did not understand how the bathroom could have tip jars and Listerine while still having pee covering every other toilet seat. I dig that there was free wifi and I liked the USB/Outlet counter$LABEL$3
Luggage took FOREVER to get.  Must have been standing there for at least 30 minutes.  Doh!$LABEL$2
I've had a few connections at CLT... usually due to missing another flight$LABEL$4
OK$LABEL$1
This airport has ridiculously long lines.  Overpriced food at airports is a given$LABEL$1
beautiful airport- no wall plugs$LABEL$3
my reasoning of giving this airport 2 stars is only because its reallllly outdated$LABEL$2
Not as pretty as SFO$LABEL$3
Get here early.  Security is bi-polar.  Either there is no line$LABEL$3
I like CLT for a \""bigger\"" airport.   Parking costs me $4 a day which is crazy cheap.  THe food isn't bad$LABEL$4
For some reason$LABEL$2
I like how updated and clean this airport is compared to others.  However$LABEL$3
This airport is pretty huge. It has a real nice area by the food that has a bunch of rocking chairs by the windows. The seating areas are a little dated and the chairs are pretty beat. Otherwise$LABEL$3
I love CLT!! My favorite airport to get stuck in. The people are nice$LABEL$5
I like this airport.  Check-in hasn't ever been bad for me.  Security/TSA has been as good as one could expect.  If you have time to spare$LABEL$4
You gotta love an airport with rocking chairs!Welcome to CLT!!  Granted there are nicer$LABEL$4
Clean and a quick airport to get in and out of!$LABEL$4
Meh. I do not love this airport. But that might be because I am normally flying USAirways when I come through here.I traditionally hate them as an airline.I feel like the security line is always ridiculously long here$LABEL$3
Niiiice airport. I usually fly through Atlanta$LABEL$4
All three stars go to the ladies in charge of the bathrooms.  Charlotte has the best bathrooms - its official. Super clean$LABEL$3
I like the rocking chairs and the view at sunrise at the end of terminal D.$LABEL$3
Eh$LABEL$3
Beautiful! Was in US Airways terminal.  Plenty of places open and serving at 10:00 pm (when I had left New Orleans at 6:30pm and there was NOTHING serving except UNO pizzas in food stands and rude people telling me it would be 7 minutes and continued to play on her flip phone from the 80s.)$LABEL$4
I usually have to connect here and it's not too bad. It's a bit sprawling but it's clean. I like the rocking chairs and free wifi as well as the live piano player they sometimes have by the sushi bar. Plus$LABEL$4
These are one of those reviews where I don't know what to say. How do you review airports$LABEL$3
I like this airport. I've been stuck here many a-times between domestic and international layovers.  The layout is pretty easy to understand - you do have to walk a lot between terminals so wear comfy shoes and have good wheels on your suitcase.  Most if not all the terminals are connected via walking so you don't need to catch a shuttle. However this means you are walking a lot - as I said above.The main hub area that connects a lot of the terminals together has a good selection of restaurants.  I've hung out there a few times - once during my layover in 2005 from Nicaragua where I watched the Superbowl at a Chili's or something similar.  There are definitely a few vegan options around for food.There are some good stores for shopping too if you have more time to kill after that first or second Bloody Mary.It's not the best airport but it's pretty good as far as navigation$LABEL$4
Given that this is presently my \""home airport\"" I'd better know it enough to review it given that I feel quick to comment on the other airports I've been through.Bottom line: the place is relatively clean$LABEL$3
There is a restroom butler! Really! Is that necessary in an airport? With a tip jar? Or was this the high end VIP lounge? Huge distances between gates. For a connecting airport this is a tight race. Short notice on change of gate notifications.$LABEL$3
(2.75 stars)  Charlotte-Douglas may be my favorite large airport in the Eastern US.  The arrangement of terminals is easy to maneuver$LABEL$2
While it's my local airport$LABEL$3
Very outdated$LABEL$2
Ok$LABEL$4
Stepping off the plane and into this airport was a bit like a Dramamine induced hallucination.Rocking chairs... white$LABEL$3
Charlotte Douglas airport  is a credit to the area.The place is clean$LABEL$5
Nice airport with good dining choices. The US Airways Lounge is great too.$LABEL$4
It is actually one of the smoothest airports to navigate and has quite a variety of food options$LABEL$4
At least the US Airways terminal (which might be the whole airport$LABEL$4
This airport is just kinda weird. I went to the Caribbean via US Air and had to transfer here twice. The first time I was able to sneak onto the early flight in the adjacent gate$LABEL$2
Ugh. This is one of the more confusing airports for me$LABEL$3
This is a good airport for first-time flyers$LABEL$3
I'm not a seasoned airport pro by any means$LABEL$3
Cleanest.  Airport.  Ever.$LABEL$4
Pretty good airport - average selection of restaurants/shops$LABEL$3
I was delayed at this airport and I must say I was really happy to see a spa there. I got a 20 minute massage for $30 and it was worth every minute.$LABEL$3
We're usually routed through here for our Caribbean trips as well. It's a pretty decent airport$LABEL$4
A nice quiet airport with plenty of shopping. The womens restroom has a bathroom attendant and is very clean$LABEL$4
The two stars are bonus points$LABEL$2
It's an airport$LABEL$3
Long term parking lot was way over crowded. They have at least two but only one was open. Why? People were having to park on the curbs because no parking places were open. Plus$LABEL$2
This is a nice$LABEL$3
After I napped from Vegas to Charlotte we had our 1st lay over here. The first thing I noticed after coming off the plane was a lot of stores$LABEL$4
THIS PLACE HAS MORE RESTAURANTS THAN I COULD COUNT!!! And everyone was so helpful and friendly.  Maybe I should visit Charlotte itself and not just their Airport$LABEL$5
I like this airport because:- It has jamba juice- It has lots of flights and connections- It is clean and the people are pretty friendlyMy complaint?- walkways are WAYYYYYYYY too narrow for the volume of people walking down each concourse$LABEL$4
One of my favorite Airports to be lay-overed in. Wide selection of restaurants to grab a bite and the lay out is very simple.$LABEL$4
This airport is really nice. That is all O_O$LABEL$3
This is my first time being at the Charlotte Airport and I had heard stories that it was big$LABEL$2
I like CLT.  This airport is large and has a lot of people going through it$LABEL$4
We are in the midst of a very stressful transition$LABEL$1
This airport is my go to airport when I have a layover.  There are tons of places to eat$LABEL$4
Half hour layover turned into an hour plus. Here's why: out of 2 gates 3 flights are being called: fort Lauderdale$LABEL$1
Charlotte-Douglas is a very small airport and it pretty easy to navigate as a result. Security is pretty smooth and I usually only have to arrive 1 hour to 45 minutes before my flight to get to the gate on time. I always check in electronically$LABEL$3
I like this airport for a lot of reasons   But one really obscure one popped up recently when looking at the airport map.  Holy cow$LABEL$4
Clean$LABEL$4
One of the lucky airports this week was (opens envelope) Charlotte-Douglas! Woooo!  This is a frequent stop for layover connections due to the fact US Airways uses this as one of if not their main hubs. It is pretty big and has a ton of shops and food available should the need arise.\""The Good\""- TSA is TSA$LABEL$3
Bigger airport than one would think. Very busy and always on the move. Easy to get around however.$LABEL$4
It's airport.  The parking was a little sucky due to renovations in June.  In August they were still renovating but it felt a lot easier.  We left our car here in August when we travelled.  $5 per 24 hour period.  Bargain.  The shuttle ran regularly.The airport itself is easy to get around.  It didn't seem far from check in to the gate.$LABEL$3
CLT has one of the largest selections of dining out of any airport I have ever been to. Shopping as well$LABEL$4
For some reason I always have to connect between terminal E and terminal A. As a hub it's pretty busy so hoof it to your next gate!$LABEL$2
I like this one. Not one of my favorites but it is very clean and TSA is always nice and respectful. My only gripe is the lines at TSA feel like they take forever$LABEL$3
Very busy$LABEL$3
+ Relax on the rocking chairs+ Countless dining options+ Shopping and massage places to pass the time+ Plenty of seating at all the gates+ FREE WIFI!$LABEL$5
It's the place I have to go to get anywhere from Roanoke$LABEL$3
Clean$LABEL$4
It was a pass through. When I stopped by$LABEL$2
It's tough living in Charlotte. If you have to check a bag it usually takes the bag longer to make it from the airplane to baggage claim than it takes to fly it from MEM to CLT - must be the highly efficient union labor...$LABEL$1
Pretty easy getting through the airport to baggage to my shuttle.  Lots of hotel choices nearby and then back again really early in the morning.  Multiple lines for security and any of them will work$LABEL$4
One of the best airports I've ever been to in terms of overall quality.  The airport has moving sidewalks everywhere$LABEL$5
Bottom line at the top: TSA is definitely nicer here but they need to work on dining options. Until that happens$LABEL$3
There is a Jamba Juice here. I like Charlotte's airport for two reasons only:1. There is a Jamba Juice that makes matcha there.2. While US Airways is awful$LABEL$3
Any airport that US Airways calls a hub means that it is going to be a giant disappointment.   The wifi lived up to my expectations.  It was impossible to get on the wifi$LABEL$3
seriously? concierge service and tip jars in the bathrooms? but what happens if no one tips? (shudder)$LABEL$4
I feel like reviewing an airport is similar to reviewing my utilities provider.  Unless I don't like hot water$LABEL$4
So chill. How chill you ask?.... They have ROCKING CHAIRS! Yes$LABEL$4
Weird airport setup. Not really a fan.$LABEL$2
This airport is just about always busy - and that can be a little annoying. Wanna walk from point A to point B? Well$LABEL$4
My home airport.  It's okay but it takes forever to get through the checkpoint.  I'd rather sit at the gate than stand in line waiting to quickly strip down my stuff to go through the checkpoint.  There are lots of options for food$LABEL$3
Is there anything this airport doesn't have?  I have changed flights here on several occasions and each time I fight the urge to stop at Cinnabon... That smell is dangerous.  They have several restaurants$LABEL$4
**Free Wifi** wins my heart every time. There aren't many charging stations but there are plenty of rocking chairs. I've been here a few times and I always enjoy my short layover here. There are a lot of Starbucks scattered throughout so have no fear$LABEL$4
Avg.$LABEL$3
No$LABEL$4
Nice airport$LABEL$4
I hate hate hate hate hate this airport$LABEL$2
Gross$LABEL$5
It's ok... As far as airports go!  I quite enjoy sitting back and watching people sprint barefoot through the airport to get to their connection!!!!$LABEL$3
Positives:Easy to navigate terminals. Terminal E is a hike though.Plentiful eateries$LABEL$3
Lines at TSA PreCheck is short. Love it.$LABEL$3
I connect here when possible. It's easy to navigate$LABEL$5
Not a terrible experience but not an amazing one. I like LAX as my favorite airport. The wifi is speedy and sso are the check ins. San Deigo has a good airport. I didn't check in so I have never waited in line at TSA. I have had this as a stop over ALOT because I've flown US airways a million times. Its wifi its spotty. It restaurants are over prices for a state that ends in Carolina. Also no place to plug in devices like Phoenix$LABEL$2
I've got both good and bad comments about this place$LABEL$3
Just as a southern airport should be.  Clean and cozy. White rocking chairs where one can recharge the feet as well as technology.  Really sweet.The restroom is another nice surprise. It's clean$LABEL$4
I have an inside joke with my significant other about this place. We officially hate Charlotte. Everyone who works in this airport is miserable. So it has made us assume that everyone in Charlotte must be as well.  For its size$LABEL$1
Charlotte Airport is the pits!  Here's why:MAZE - this spot is huge and an absolute maze.  I was flying back on an already 2-hr delayed flight and had to clear customs$LABEL$2
Clean$LABEL$4
Recently I have flown more often than I used to$LABEL$4
I always seem to get placed on the complete opposite end of the airport$LABEL$2
The flight from Myrtle Beach International Airport into Charlotte International was very pleasant$LABEL$3
This place is huge$LABEL$5
Might just be the must confusing airport I have ever been in$LABEL$3
Easy to navigate. Plenty of food options. Careful about the distance between terminals though..$LABEL$4
CLT reminds me of what CVG used to be- huge$LABEL$3
The food options are spread out$LABEL$2
This airport is not the best. Very little seating$LABEL$2
Worst airport ever. I have been here 3 times for lay-overs and 3 out of 3 times my flight has been cancelled or delayed. The worst part is not the incompetence$LABEL$1
Bojangles is awesome in this airport. Great chicken sandos!$LABEL$3
Charlotte Douglas International Airport is one of the best there is. I travel as much as I can and I have never had a problem. The lines are moderate in length and the employees are as courteous as can be expected. Parking is never a problem$LABEL$4
Bojangles in Terminal B$LABEL$3
It's an airport.  It is not near the top of my favorites.$LABEL$2
Plenty of rocking chairs$LABEL$4
I was here while there was a rain storm going on the east coast and I was re routed to the Charlotte airport instead of Philly. I was impressed by the size and organization of this airport. All of the escalators and walkways were functional and restrooms were very clean. They were very fast at moving air traffic as soon as the runway was cleared and we were able to take off about 15 minutes before the scheduled departure time (after being delayed by 30 minutes). There are plenty of options for shopping and dining. I did not have much time to explore everything but very impressed by the sheer size and architecture of it.$LABEL$4
Had my first opportunity to visit NC the other week and flew into Charlotte Douglass International. The airport wasn't as big as I had imagined it would be$LABEL$4
Horrible. Awful. Worst US airport ever!Ladies bring your dollars. No your not going to the strip club$LABEL$2
I've seen a few American airports by now and i have to say that this one is probarly one the nicest and cleanest i've ever been. Nice dining area and great food choices!Staff is very nice and as far as i relember$LABEL$5
This airport is scary.  I've never encountered so many people handing out bibles to people on a layover flight.  I now have no interest in flying back.$LABEL$1
I was only here for about an hour during a layover so I can't really speak for the whole airport but during my short visit I wasn't too impressed. My flight from Tampa let out right near the gate of my connecting flight$LABEL$2
Big airport with many electric walkways that makes it easy to go the long distances between gates.  The Atriums have white rocking chairs. Many trees as well line the main atrium.$LABEL$3
Pretty good overall. the concourses are designed to require lots of walking to go from one to another$LABEL$3
Design isn't very nice$LABEL$3
First thing I noticed were the rocking chairs. Wish I had time to chill out in one of them$LABEL$3
This airport needs a train like Atlanta.$LABEL$2
This airport reminds me of O'hare because it is huge. I mean you 99.9% of the time$LABEL$3
CLT is my go to airport! Living in the Triad PTI doesn't really have that many options to work with so often times I have to drive on over to Charlotte. I like that the airport is all one building no need to take a tram or bus anywhere$LABEL$4
If ever an airport that resembles Hartsfield as far as driving up$LABEL$3
Pretty normal airport$LABEL$4
If you fly UsAir$LABEL$3
If you connect in Charlotte expect constant delays!!!!!   Every time I connect through to Dulles I experience planes with mechanical delays$LABEL$1
Dear Airport:  I've never been inside you$LABEL$1
I have spent more time than I care to share in CLT but it is still my favorite airport. The layout is super easy and I feel comfortable knowing that I landed in C Terminal but am connecting in E Terminal$LABEL$5
Flown in twice now.  The traffic pattern system for incoming and outgoing jets is a nightmare!  Access to outer runways is practically through the center of the inner runway$LABEL$2
This may totally be TMI but what public restroom of such an institution doesn't have toilet covers?? I'm already dodging people in the airport$LABEL$2
There are a good selection of places to eat. Nice lobby$LABEL$2
This is the most outdated and dingy major city airport I've ever seen. I was shocked that such a large beautiful and clean city has this to offer as it's first and last impression. CLT is begging for a major renovation!The location$LABEL$2
This is not a bad airport.  I had my first connecting flight ever here and luckily they were smart to put the star alliance altogether so you do not have to hike 3 miles to your connection.  Since it is a smaller airport there is a lot less traffic and you will leave on time.  I have used this airport twice so far and I remember they were pretty good the last time too.1/2 star off.  High calorie fatty food.  No lighter options.  1.5 stars off.  SHUT THAT DAMN BEEPING HANDICAP GO CART OFF!!!!  The last thing I want to hear is a constant beep every three minutes at 10 o'clock at night with these stupid carts pacing back and forth without any passengers.$LABEL$3
Um$LABEL$1
I've flow in and out of here a number of times and in comparison to the various airports both in this country and around the world$LABEL$3
CLT  Depends on your carrier but there is some nice food options. It's been upgraded recently$LABEL$4
A bit dark in the evening. Could use more signage. Customs can take a while$LABEL$3
i hate US Airways$LABEL$1
I can't speak for going through TSA$LABEL$4
Oh$LABEL$3
My problem here is that I expect better. The Charlotte Douglas airport is one that I sort of dread in that it is so close to RDU that it seems like a complete waste of my time to be there in the first place. It is only about a 30 min flight to and from RDU so I am already frustrated when I arrive. I'll give you that. However$LABEL$2
Nice Airport$LABEL$3
It's been a long time since I've been to this airport. The last time I went through it I just remember spending several hours (due to weather) being delayed. I made many a lap from C Concourse$LABEL$3
Bible belt y'all.  First things first... the airport is just fine.  It is clean$LABEL$3
Oh Charlotte$LABEL$4
Not a fan at all.  Although the place is bright and clean I found the airport staff to be extremely unfriendly.The bathroom attendents are sort of weird too.$LABEL$2
Decent.  I had no clue this place was so spacious for a relatively small airport.  I loved the rocking chair seating options throughout the terminals.  The bathrooms were clean...though I wasn't sure how I felt about the old school bathroom attendee.  Dates the place....and awkward in an airport setting.  It was easy enough to find my way around.  Loved that they had a Jamba Juice$LABEL$3
The airport is going thru some major remodeling and additions to the parking spaces and there is a major construction area going on. This is causing some major delays when getting the bus to the parking lots and it looks that not many buses are available when many people need them. Hopefully the situation is going to improve in the near future.$LABEL$3
Easy to navigate. The best thing each time I connect in Charlotte is the Piano player between Concourse B and A. So nice to see live peaceful music in the hussle and bussle of the airport.$LABEL$3
It's big and busy with a Starbucks on every concourse.  It's not too difficult to make it from one end of the building to the other$LABEL$4
Nice airport in decent condition. The food and shopping selections have improved over the years. While I find it a tad annoying to have a restroom attendant$LABEL$4
CLT:Without a doubt$LABEL$3
The airport is fine but the bathroom attendants have GOT TO GO! especially when they keep talking while you're trying to use the facilities...not okay.$LABEL$2
Worst airport in the area. Never come to CLT on Monday morning. The valet parking was full by 6:10 am. Security lines are ridiculous. I drove up from Columbia SC for the last time.$LABEL$1
It's a big and busy airport with a lot of flights$LABEL$4
Great airport. Air travel is rarely a pleasant experience$LABEL$4
I personally thought this place is the front runner of the new concept of the airport.  I have used this place twice for connecting flight$LABEL$4
One of the few US airports that I have encountered with toilet attendants.  This concept is ok$LABEL$2
Worst airport ever.. Flight to Jacksonville was schedule for 9:19am.. I'm currently still sitting at the airport nearly 2 hours later. The lady on the overhead has been telling the passengers we will leave in 15-20 minutes. At this point I'm tired of hearing that. Now I know if there was something wrong with the plane then it's understandable but no we have yet to board the aircraft due to the 1st officer not being here on time.. Now if you know there's a flight schedule why wouldn't you make sure the person is her or even better have a back up plan.. Ridiculous planning if you ask me!! All I'm saying is SFO left on time and arrived in Charlotte early.. Now that's a good job well done.. As for my first time in Charlotte.. No never again.. I'll just pay extra for a direct flight$LABEL$1
Large$LABEL$4
I arrived at Charlotte 15 minutes before my plane was supposed to leave. I had to transfer from terminal B to terminal E. When I asked for them to hold my flight$LABEL$1
great restaurants and fabulous people.  Have to love the Southern Hospitality even from the TSA agents$LABEL$4
CLT is my favorite major airport in the US. Am I biased because I work for the City of Charlotte and the City owns/runs CLT??? -Perhaps... but$LABEL$5
This airport has the absolute WORST and SLOWEST security lines in the country$LABEL$1
I was only there for a second in between flight but they could have more charger ports. Its huge!! I had  to go from one terminal to another of course but it felt like it took forever!!! I was glade I had a hour between flights$LABEL$3
Not bad for a scare port. Plenty of concourse room... rocking chairs$LABEL$3
Terrible parking/access due to an un-phased parking upgrade.  Slow to nonexistent parking shuttles.  The absolute worst baggage handling times.  They do a decent job but come on$LABEL$2
So it wouldn't have occurred to me to review the airport$LABEL$4
I've been flying into Charlotte for most of my adult life ..... Mostly because flying into Columbia is so god awful expensive. It's always been a pleasant experience with no real hiccups ever.  Current construction on the parking structure means parking further away and taking a shuttle.The airport itself is cozy ( quite small ) but has everything one might need at the beginning of a travel day or at the end. TONS of hotel options in the area. A fair amount of food options throughout the terminal. There IS a Starbucks. The TSA process seems to be relatively organized ( that's saying something ).The staff of the airport are actually very friendly$LABEL$4
Tiny little airport that does what it needs to do - one could also fly directly into Atlanta and catch the shuttle out to Chattanooga$LABEL$3
The one-star review nearly wrote itself as I stepped into an older portion of the concourse from the tarmac. Outdated fluorescent lighting$LABEL$3
Five years later$LABEL$4
Been here several times. Fairly convenient parking$LABEL$3
Good enough airport that's easy enough to navigate.  Okay food options$LABEL$3
Easy to park at the long term lots and at a good rate.  Security lines are annoyingly long for not that busy of an airport.  Usually because they only have 1 scanner open at a time.$LABEL$3
the airport has certainly grown over the last 10 years.  great ambiance with the rocking chairs in the atrium for passengers that have a long wait between flights and do not wish to wait at their gate.  continue to grow and hurry up and finish with the construction with the parking!!!$LABEL$4
I ALWAYS seem to have a lay over here when I'm going anywhere back home to Ohio$LABEL$5
1. Crowded with narrow walkways.2. Wi-Fi - Low capacity bandwidth$LABEL$2
Came to this airport to connect to another flight. Had a 12 hour layover which is fine because I was made aware of this upon booking the flight. Went downstairs to baggage claim because the airline overhead compartments were full (again no big deal). Picked up luggage only to be told cannot go back upstairs where restaurants since we left out the main area of the airport!? I informed the agent that we have not eaten and ONLY came downstairs because that's we were advised to do. She informed us that there was a Starbucks and that we could eat there (totally not what I was looking forward to). BUT I can deal with that..although I was very upset at the moment. What I cannot deal with are MICE running past my feet upon working on my computer and eating my sandwich!! This is totally UNACCEPTABLE for an airport and I advise EVERYONE that comes to this airport to watch your bags..and don't put them on the floor!! This is the last time I will be flying into Charlotte airport if I can help it..and If I have to come here I will just rent a car and drive...smhDissatisfied customer ...$LABEL$1
First time in Charlotte and the VPOTUS delayed my flights by more than fifty minutes.  This time we encounter a bit of a jerk gate attendant from US Airways.  Really unprofessional in her handling of a traveler that happened to have missed her earlier calls to him.  Heck$LABEL$1
Other than the food court that is built at the intersection of the terminals$LABEL$2
Well for an airport I really have no complaints. It may not be the biggest airport there is but it does have the best USO I have been too. Serving hot and cold food 24 hours a day$LABEL$4
Avoid at all costs$LABEL$1
On the plus side: for on time departures this is one of the best airports in the country. On the negative: it feels like a cattle feed lot$LABEL$3
Our company favors US Air$LABEL$3
I fly US Airways all the time but I'm based in Phoenix$LABEL$2
One of the nicer airports to fly into$LABEL$4
Airport is okay$LABEL$3
Shockingly this is an aiport that has more business that you would think. It is always busy here and the most popular airline is US Airways so I am not sure how I feel about that. The aiport as whole is great and has lots of places you can grab food or kill some time while you are waiting for your plane. The cutest thing is also the fact that they have white rocking chairs for you to sit in while you are waiting and gives you a more homey and small town feel. When I landed here initially I got off the plane and was thrown off at the fact that I had to walk doen  the steps of the plane and walk outside before getting to my gate. Definitely a first. Other than that I enjoyed my time at the aiport. The one thing that I did notice though was that all the peope in the aiport who worked there or were from there were extremely RUDE. I am not sure why that is since it is such a nice town$LABEL$2
Dear Charlotte Airport:Why don't you pay your restroom attendants enough money so that they don't have to beg for tips? After spending money for the flight$LABEL$2
Be patient.  It's a nice airport but it does get chaotic.  Scheduling seems to be random and gates get really busy with flights leaving right next to or across from one another.$LABEL$4
I hate airports.  They are like jails.  Except you have to be arrested to get thrown out. Charlotte Douglas is better than most.  There are rocking chairs$LABEL$3
Poor food quality. Ordered the burrito which was not rolled correctly so it fell apart almost as soon as I started to eat it. The guacamole tasted stale and had the wrong consistency. The food was fast though$LABEL$2
The rest room attendants greet you and ensure that you pick up on their large \""tip\"" jars placed by the hand basins - a nice little earner$LABEL$2
This airport was one of my layovers from Puerto and I loved it. The gate signs were well lit and it was hard to get lost. The different concourse were always easy to navigate to. Theu had rocking chairs in some of the common waiting areas and I thought that was so cool. There was a lot of food places on the US airways terminal which was awesome because I was starving. They have some cool decore$LABEL$4
yeah$LABEL$3
I've been in and out of this airport alot lately.   I decided to write a review after passing through today on another international USAirways flight.   I love their customs and immigration$LABEL$4
I showed up at this airport late on a Friday night after lots of travel delays and cancellations-- so I was not in the greatest mood. But every single person that worked at the airport that I interacted with was incredibly kind and thoughtful. They were so wonderful that it made me want to move to NC. Charlotte airport is incredibly lucky to have such amazing employees.$LABEL$5
This airport is having a terrible time with the parking solution right now. they need to get this fix quickly. apparently they are rebuilding new parking decks so in order to park you have to park at the lots across some street and get on a suttle in order to get  back to the airport. so terrible if you are not just picking up and dropping off your friends and family.$LABEL$1
Terrible congestion.  Poor planning.  Poor traffic flow.  Poor crowd control.  This airport is 20 years behind other airports of similar size and volume.  Be forewarned.  You will have a 20-40 minute wait to get to passenger drop off or pick up$LABEL$1
I travel really often$LABEL$5
Over the years I have hit a number of airports$LABEL$5
Us airways is incompetent and unfit to call themselves an airline!  True story emergency landing and stuck in the airport for 4 hours with no answers!!! No one seems to know what's going on?$LABEL$1
Nope not any better this time around. Still hectic$LABEL$1
People honestly review airports? As if you have options? As if you honestly decide whether or not to visit a city because of it's airport? The fact this this has 800+ reviews blew my mind!$LABEL$4
Quickest airport I've been through! The precheck facility allows you to roll through with a jacket and shoes! Also no headache with taking your laptop out!$LABEL$4
If you can avoid checking your bags when flying into this airport - DO SO.  Worst baggage claim area I've ever experienced.  Over 45-minutes to get luggage.$LABEL$1
This airport$LABEL$3
I don't really fly that much and have only been to a handful of airports. Being that I live near Charlotte$LABEL$3
I guess if you fly USAirways$LABEL$1
Nice and simple but effici\u00ebnt layout. Tons of food and drink options. The only downer are the hopelessly outdated furniture and floor carpeting in the waiting areas..$LABEL$3
One word to describe this place- awful. Sure not as bad as Philly$LABEL$1
Not a bad airport.  Layout was okay - wide enough walkways$LABEL$3
Nice airport with a good selection of shops and food.  It's a growing airport which is pretty large and has a large amount of passengers moving about.  Be sure to map your gates out in advance to make your travels smoother.$LABEL$3
Seeing as I am here now for a layover to go back home. I'd like to say.... Some of these people are rude as crap.. This is my first time at this particular airport and the layout is different from the ones I've been to.. Never heard of \""concourses\"" and my boarding pass didn't have a gate number. So naturally$LABEL$2
Its an airport....... they are constantly building and adding on to this airport. It is definitely growing and getting huge.$LABEL$3
CLT is very easy to navigate through and with Pre-check at this airport getting to your gate is easy.Love the large food court as soon as you go through the checkpoint.$LABEL$4
To-date$LABEL$3
Went on several websites to find a map that shows a baggage claim area location. There isn't.  Called several airlines they were unable to find anything. What's up with that.$LABEL$1
Charlotte Douglas parking has been under construction for years - it's a nightmare. The valet companies are terrible and waits have been up to an hour even if you decide to splurge for convenience and avoid the construction. The airport is overcrowded$LABEL$3
I have no idea how things are on the Departure side of Security.   But$LABEL$1
Everything good in this airport is RUINED by the obnoxious level of loud music playing by terminal D7 at \""The Local Rustic Market\"". I was unable to talk on the phone or hear any announcements about my flight status over the music. I asked if they could turn it down and the manager suggested I walk down the hall$LABEL$1
The airport is large which means that you will most likely be walking quite a ways to get to your gate.  That being said$LABEL$4
This airport will one day not be under construction and will be built out to service the growing population in The CLT area. For now$LABEL$3
Been in three airports on our trip to North Carolina. I know it's summer. What happen to the air conditioning. They've lied if its about being GREEN. It's about the other green!!!$LABEL$1
As I fly a lot to Pensacola$LABEL$4
Got nuthin against it. Pretty big$LABEL$3
The most ridiculous airport for connections. New union rules have imposed a ground shutdown if there is lightning within a mile if the airport. You can be siting on the tarmac only a few feet from a gate for over half an hour and not able to get out. In the meantime your connecting flight can be boarding. Once the shutdown is over your connecting flight is ready to go$LABEL$1
Nice airport$LABEL$3
Terrible airport for a layover. Walking from E40 something over to B6 should not be do laborious and definitely would be hard to do successfully with any shorter of a layover or if my other flight had not landed a smidge early. Not to mention half the moving walkways were not working. Will be avoiding layovers here in the future.$LABEL$2
You cannot sleep inside the terminal overnight$LABEL$3
This is a huge airport with flights just about everywhere. However$LABEL$4
The airport$LABEL$3
This is by far one of the warmest and most crowded airports I've been to.I'm not sure how big this airport is$LABEL$3
Very nice airport! Lots of places to spend money!!! No electrical outlets- (few)$LABEL$2
I changed my mind.... Not a bad airport at all. My beef is the airline. Free wifi$LABEL$4
Even with a relatively short layover$LABEL$3
Concourse C..starting with the nasty B at Wolfgang Puck...you VOLUNTEERED for the job. Maybe ringing up pre packaged food is not for you. This is not the first time I have had the displeasure of you nasty attitude. I am sorry your life is so miserable$LABEL$1
All-in-all this is a very nice airport.  Some reviews say it is small$LABEL$4
3 1/2 star rating?! How much crack are you people smoking!? I will give you three (3) reasons this place sucks balls:-The whole point of an outlet is it to supply energy...none of your outlets do this..so what are they? Because$LABEL$2
Well Charlotte is always busy but reasonably easy to navigate to your next gate if your lay over is here.  I have flown many miles and I like this airport a lot$LABEL$4
Bathroom attendant doing a fine job$LABEL$2
I wouldn't usually write a review on an airport$LABEL$2
Parking at this airport is something out of a paradox.  From the outside it looks like this place has more parking than actual space for the airplanes.  However$LABEL$3
The \""moving sidewalks\"" make it efficient to get to your gate quickly through the hustle and bustle. Not enough time for food between connections$LABEL$3
This airport has not evolved or grown to accommodate its business. Similar to PHL; it is over capacity at each gate$LABEL$2
First things first$LABEL$4
Women in baggage claim lied about where my bag was as they wouldn't even look it up in their computer. After burping Chinese food in my face and refusing to look in the computer I accepted what they were telling me only to arrive at my destination bag less. Unprofessional$LABEL$1
One of the smallest airport in the U.S.  Flew here for a short layover to Greenville (GSP).  Can't really stand small airport since all the planes are so small and me being 6'4\"" is very difficult to sit comfortably in my seat.  Next time I'll fly into big airports.$LABEL$3
We have to fly through this airport every time we visit my family who live in South Carolina. I am not a fan. First of all$LABEL$2
This is not a bad airport$LABEL$3
Avoid this airport. Had a connecting stop here on our way back from Mexico and hated every minute of it. Had to collect our bags and go thru security again was a huge pain in the rear. After that no real food in the entire E concourse. Creepy bathroom attendants handing out Listerine and mints. Over crowded tiny gates with no place to sit or charge a phone. Any review that says this place is great seriously has not been anywhere. CLE$LABEL$1
Get ready to walk or run$LABEL$2
Painful getting in and out of here with the construction and insane traffic.  For its volume$LABEL$2
We arrived an hour early for a domestic flight and security was so slow that I had to run to catch my flight.  Their excuse?  \""Some time are a little slower than others.\""Advice to passengers:Arrive AT LEAST an hour and a half early.Advice to the airport:Get your act together.$LABEL$1
It's a nice airport to have a layover in. Free wifi is only for 45 minutes but there are tons of eateries$LABEL$4
Not a bad layout for a large airport.  Lots of convenience here.  Lots of places to shop and eat which makes it nice if you're having to lay over for more than an hour.  I don't like monster airports.$LABEL$3
Totally passable. Clean and compact. Not many amenities. Good place to connect to other lathers airports.$LABEL$3
Disclaimer: I've only passed through this airport for connection flights and I've never had much of a lay over. It's not as big as many of the other hubs like Detroit$LABEL$2
I was not real happy at this airport$LABEL$2
Southern hospitality at its finest! I very much enjoy traveling through this airport. Security check in is usually a breeze and they have so many restaurants and shops in the gates. They are always so decked out too during the holiday season! It's a great airport to be at if you have a layover...shop$LABEL$4
food choices are wide in variety$LABEL$3
Charlotte Douglas Airport is one of my favorites for grabbing a connection. It is very easy to navigate$LABEL$3
This is by far the worst airport ever. We have went to 3 different food place to eat and have had a bad experience at all of them. The first one took over  an hour tonget our drink order then came back and said oh you have 5 minutes to order I said ok I'll take this sandwich \""oh we don't have it or this or this \"" that was a larger portion of the menu so we said well I guess we are not eating here finished our drinks had to go ask for the check and meantime I saw our server dig in the trash for silverware and not wash his hands before grabbing food! The bk and taco place was also awful workers seemed extremely rude and bk took 15 min but the food was right there the whole time. Just don't eat here stay away avoid at all cost !$LABEL$1
I had to go from B to E$LABEL$5
Flew two days after Christmas and there was basically one security line that took an eternity to get through. Technically there were multiple lines but we were told that one was first class & priority (Checkpoint C) and the other (Checkpoint D) we couldn't use for some other reason and we were told to go down to Checkpoint E. I had arrived at the airport with two hours to spare and ended up running for my plane. I've flown out of Charlotte dozens of times but have never seen the staff as unprepared for holiday travel as this. At least they finally have short term parking again.$LABEL$2
For an airport$LABEL$3
Charlotte is usually my layover in transit when I cannot have a straight flight. With that being said I'm going from the gate and I do not have the full TSA$LABEL$4
If \""not as bad as LaGuardia\"" is a standard$LABEL$3
I enjoyed this airport. Pretty quick to get in and out$LABEL$4
Clean and open airport. Loved it!$LABEL$5
Pretty decent airport.  Rocking chairs everywhere giving a quaint look. Pretty laid back and people are nice.$LABEL$4
The museum is cleverly located inside a hangar$LABEL$3
I think the effort to make this a tourist attraction is there$LABEL$2
I took my husband here as a surprise.  He wanted to be a fighter pilot when he was growing up$LABEL$3
\""A Miracle on the Hudson...\""I absolutely LOVE aviation so this was one place my BF and I had set plans to visits. I've been to the aviation museum down in Pensacola and in D.C.$LABEL$4
The Carolina's Aviation Museum is located adjacent to the Charlotte Douglas International Airport. It is a rather small museum consisting of a variety of Military and Commercial Aircraft's housed in a single hanger. The centerpiece of the Museum is the US Airway Airbus A320 which was force to crash land in the Hudson River after striking a flock of birds which disabled both engines. Everyone on-board US Airways Flight 1549 survived what has been described as \""The Miracle on the Hudson.\""   While at the \""Flight 1549\"" display be sure to watch the documentary presentation$LABEL$4
a pretty neat museum.  it's not a large one$LABEL$4
I'm a pilot$LABEL$2
I was flying out of Charlotte and got to the airport really early for my flight so I opted for breakfast.  Being that Burger King is one of the only places open really early$LABEL$2
I felt like a farm animal ordering and waiting for my food in the morning before my flight$LABEL$3
Slowwwwwwwwwww  - I do not normally rate fast food places - you get what you pay for$LABEL$1
We ordered breakfast here during a layover. My croissant was literally dripping cloudy looking water.  Since we plopped down almost 20 bucks$LABEL$1
I asked if it had tomatoes. I said I was allergic to tomatoes. They said there are no tomatoes on that sandwich. Do I want tomatoes? I said no$LABEL$1
Way too pricey for the chain. I realize I'm stuck at the airport$LABEL$2
Avoid this place in the airport. 20 minutes to wait for a standard order is not acceptable. I had to wolf down my food to make my flight when I should have had plenty of time. Epic fail BK$LABEL$1
Had to argue with the cashier while ordering a kids meal. The menu clearly shows that with the kids meal you can choose apples slices instead of a toy. Instead of looking at the menu she asked another employee$LABEL$1
Horrible restaurant. They don't seem to care about customer service$LABEL$1
Young lady that served me was busy chatting (about nothing related to work) with another male coworker$LABEL$2
Wow.  I was the only one in line$LABEL$1
The worst people I have seen in the business. I asked the hostess to substitute a veggie Patty in the 4 cheese burger and she her to make sure that there was no meat in it. She took like half an hour to check if they could even make it like that. I mean what the ****! And then when I get my Burger$LABEL$1
pretty cool club right by where i live staff could be nicer though$LABEL$4
This place is pretty hard to review. Depending on your sobriety level when you leave$LABEL$4
Sundays used to be all you can drink vodka for 10 dollar cover... After paying our cover they let us know that beginning this week vodka drinks are 2 dollars... Why would anyone come on Sunday if they're pouring 2 dollar glasses of cranberry juice?$LABEL$1
Would give it 0 stars if I could. Getto place with workers that don't give a damn about customer service! Never will go here or recommend to anyone that they waste any money on this place!$LABEL$1
hmmm the guy that work up front hates his life but the club pretty fun if you have nothing better to do$LABEL$3
SHIT HOLE!!!  Too bad 0 stars is not an option here.  The staff and management are rude and only want money.  Someone sprayed pepper spray and sent multiple patrons to the ER and the staff just sat there like they could care less.  Save yourself the trouble and just flush your money down the toilet!.  This place is so ghetto and trashy.  All the money they make from $30 admissions and it still looks the same as it did in 1974.  Disgrace to the gay community!!$LABEL$1
This is one of the \""Charlotte institutions\"" that unfortunately has slipped in quality$LABEL$2
This is one of those places you desperately want to love... the decor is amazing$LABEL$2
This place has everything to be a great local Italian place except one thing$LABEL$1
Food tasted less than average$LABEL$1
Unfortunately being a Charlotte institution does not mean tasty food.Open Kitchen has been around for a while$LABEL$2
The Open Kitchen offered decent Italian food$LABEL$2
For typical$LABEL$3
Went to the Open Kitchen about a year ago and the inside was very cool$LABEL$2
It's locally owned. The building is old and historic. The inside has a very cool atmosphere.  It's within walking distance of my house.  For all of these reasons$LABEL$3
World Famous? OMG...World Famous? I am a lifelong Charlottean and the Open Kitchen of my youth must be in a pod somewhere waiting instructions from the mothership. This place gives restaurants...no...anyplace with a kitchen$LABEL$1
I grew up going to this place but will avoid it now. We went there Sunday after a Panthers game. The worst pizza I have had. I told the server. She just said$LABEL$1
I am baffled that this place is still in business and has a packed parking lot at night. It's dying for Chef Ramsey to come in and do a turnaround on it. It's textbook \""We've lost the love of cooking\"" and now takes the easy way out and used canned everything. Even the \""world famous pies\"" are frozen perfectly round manufactured pizzas with congealed cheese in one gross layer and no flavor. It's like a mini-frisbee with a little cheap pizza sauce and gross elementary school cheese. I ate one of the 8 slices of the pizza and called it quits.The lunch side salad came in a little bowl with iceberg lettuce and an INCH of Italian dressing. Yes$LABEL$1
first impressions: the world famous open kitchen has seen better days.  tattered flags$LABEL$2
This is your standard$LABEL$2
Meh.  Went here with a coupon$LABEL$2
I had lived near this place for a year and never made it there.  I'm not sure I'm sad about that either. I used a groupon to go here so I was able to taste appetizers$LABEL$3
Service was good$LABEL$1
I would love to say that it's the food that gets me in the door... but it's more about the sense of history and nostalgia that captivates you when you walk into the building.The food is okay. Not the absolute best in Charlotte... but also not the absolute worst. The lunch specials are the best deal. Big portions for the price. I can usually get two meals out of whatever I order. They come with a drink and a choice of soup or salad. The salad is a simple bowl of iceberg lettuce. My one must get here is the cheesy garlic bread. I always order a side of marinara to dump it in. Warning: you will be charged extra for that. Lasagna$LABEL$2
Within one week$LABEL$2
Wow I haven't been here since I was knee high to a grasshopper and all I have to say is BLEH! Not impressed whatsoever.. I don't know what did it in for me the stale store bought bread$LABEL$1
Groupon led me in and I was real anxious to try it. I'd driven by it for years on the way to Charlotte and the curiosity led me to buy a Groupon for half off. I was very pleased. The food had a lot of flavor. I had the egg plant dish and it was the best I'd had. There spaghetti sauce was liken to an old family recipe. Their cheese bread complimented the meal beautifully. The atmosphere made it much better$LABEL$4
Tour de Italia de Food Lion..Great place if you want to explore the wonders of canned and frozen Italian cuisine! I had the chicken Barcelona$LABEL$2
We decided to pop into the open kitchen for lunch.  Our server was very prompt in taking our order$LABEL$2
I used a groupon and still felt like they should have paid me to ingest this greasy$LABEL$1
The main reason for 2 stars is the decor$LABEL$2
I worked here for 3 years give or take so I can claim expert status on this review.Sausage Crumbles and the Marinara on the lasagna are way better than the normal meat sauce. The Meatballs are hit or miss depending on who makes them.Eggplant Parm is insanely good and my all time favorite.Sweet Tea is insanely sweetChicken Parm is great for low carb but not low fat.The Barcelona is great! but you better like melted butter because there is a half a stick of butter on your plate. and no$LABEL$4
Well$LABEL$5
Just purchased several appliances from Queen City.  I primarily worked with John at the location on Queen City Drive.  John was great to work with!  Actually$LABEL$5
CUSTOMERS BEWARE.. THERE ARE THIEVES WORKING IN THIS STORE.  I live out of state and gave my credit card number to the sales manager at this store location. His name is Robbie ..After one week.. I had over 2k dollars of fraud charged on my credit card at North Carolina Gas stations.  This has been turned over for investigation.$LABEL$1
My wife and I ordered a new washer and dryer from Queen City and everything went as smoothly as possible. The sales rep$LABEL$5
Been closed for months$LABEL$1
Though the Freedom Dr. K-Mart looks like the setting of a post-apocalyptic film and the entire chain is past its prime$LABEL$2
Yep it's in the hood and no I don't even think twice about shopping here for toys during the Christmas season for 2 simple reasons 1) I don't have to fight for a parking spot and 2) there's hardly ever a crowd.....nuff said and see ya next year!.$LABEL$3
Worst service. The cashier was trying to make the mcflurry and knew it was running out of mix. Instead of just telling me we are low on mix she gave me half a cup! Never again.$LABEL$1
I would not eat there any more. I went there late night or lets say after 4am. The staff didn't know how to greet a customer the appropriate way and was dressed any kind of way. I seen a few staffs without there McShirts on. And i know McDonalds have uniforms. Then they messed up my order. And instead of making me a new one. I believe they swap out the bacon and put this dried up steak and dried up onions on the same egg$LABEL$1
WC catered our Thanksgiving office party and did a nice ob. We ordered a traditional turkey and trimmings meal. Everything tasted delicious. The turkey was not dry as it sometimes can be$LABEL$5
I like to think of myself as an intelligent person$LABEL$1
Usaully good service but tonight they burnt all the pizza .....then gave a half done pizza ....then ran out of thin crust ! Too much drama in one night....left my family hungry and waiting 1.5 hours for pizza.....really they didn't even comp the meal but rather gave a discount off the next pizza.......not sure if I'll ever be back!$LABEL$3
This place is like Goodwill on steroids.  They have new and used stuff in just about any category you can think of.  They have furniture$LABEL$3
Value Village is the bomb. Yes$LABEL$5
I find myself wondering the racks here at least two times a week. I shop the opposite season of the current one to find the best deals. I don't never leave empty handed ! I will add this: there are no dressing rooms so be prepared! I wear a flip flops$LABEL$4
I have seen better and I can't say that I've seen worse. This is a very small McD's with only a few tables inside and a couple outside. Watching the crew for a bit$LABEL$2
You're not going here because you want a bite to eat$LABEL$2
I would never review a McDonald's normally$LABEL$1
THE Worst McDonald's I have ever experienced. Believe me$LABEL$1
Of course I got in line behind someone who wanted a detailed explanation of the price difference between a la carte or a meal. Believe it or not$LABEL$3
The ice cream machine is Always broken after 9pm AMAZING$LABEL$1
So I don't own any guns or really care to have anything to do with firearms$LABEL$3
Lemme be clear.  I don't own a gun.  I'm not into shooting guns$LABEL$5
cons      OVER PRICED!!!!!pros       EMPLOYEES KNOW THIER STUFFpros       6 MONTH LAY-A-WAY (for the over priced merchandise)For me.... just because the employess are \""knowledgeable\"" doesn't mean I have to pay an extra 75-100 bucks. This is one of the only places in Charlotte that I would feel comfy (and HAVE purchased a gun or 2 from here) coming to. I would come here to gain knowledge of a certain gun$LABEL$2
I've started attending a defensive pistol shooting club and one of my friends has lent me a gun to use$LABEL$5
No way would I ever go back. I was looking to trade and was offered 40% of what I paid. Gun was brand new. I then asked to see what they had in the price they offered me. Not much$LABEL$1
Very overpriced!!! save your money and go elsewhere. Not willing to deal!  Go to Eagle guns instead.$LABEL$1
Apparently yelp decided to remove my original review \""because it lacks a firsthand customer experience\"".  Well$LABEL$2
I had heard great things about this gun shop from my dad$LABEL$3
Hyatt's has two extremely strong reasons why you should shop there: Selection and Service.   They have the best selection of firearms$LABEL$5
Well$LABEL$2
US airways put me there at a \""discounted rate\"" and it was a hotel like something out of psycho movies. the room was gross and the shower was disgusting. worst hotel I've stayed at in years. If I could$LABEL$1
The level of disgust I feel toward this place is hardly measurable.The inn-keeper was huffy when I inquired about their \""no refunds after thirty minutes\"" policy. Wtf am I going to find in 30 minutes that's going to make me want my money back???I soon found out.Seminal-looking substance on the blanket in our first room... Roach in our second. Never again. I originally gave it two stars because they have free wifi$LABEL$1
Yikes! We won't be staying here again the next time we are in the Charlotte area. The man at the front desk was nice enough$LABEL$2
It's old. Everything was pretty clean$LABEL$2
The place looks pretty legit online$LABEL$2
nice people but the place is prettt run down. There were waterspots throughout the sleeping area and bathroom. The shower went hot to cold to hot repeatedly and I was concerned that there may be mold in the bathroom. Definitely not staying there again.$LABEL$2
Not too bad.  Lots on the menu for a deli.  Atmosphere is fair and it's a bit loud in the dining room especially with a woman yelling out numbers for order pickups (extremely irritating).  Sandwiches are ok$LABEL$3
I just started a job over here and was happy to find a little place that's right by where I'll be working.  It was a decent sized place and when we first walked in I was worried because the line was pretty long. Well$LABEL$4
Decent lunch.. Greek American. We were over at the airport center for training and there are not a lot of choices for lunch so we decided to check out this place that was within walking distance. Menu includes hot sandwiches$LABEL$2
I tried this place and loved it! While the outside may not be fancy the customer service is warm and fuzzy. I tried the black bean and corn veggie burger that was pretty good. I ordered the vegetable soup as a side item is was good but a little to salty for my taste. The coffee is decent and the prices are reasonable. Support this local family owned diner you won't be disappointed!$LABEL$4
Popular neighborhood chinese food joint with ample buffet. Started with take-out$LABEL$2
This place is closed last year.$LABEL$1
I wouldn't take a date here$LABEL$4
If someone took their basement$LABEL$3
It doesn't get any better than this. My heart overfloweth.$LABEL$5
Located in a less than desireable area of Charlotte$LABEL$4
The Milestone is all of the following things: dark$LABEL$4
It's funny this bar/venue when I first came in would have gotten probably 4/5 stars. I've gone to punk and hardcore shows all across the country. So$LABEL$2
Well$LABEL$2
I don't know about nirvana but I'm pretty sure I saw black flag their it looked like a small house the stage was just a raised board so called punks slam danced one dressed like a doctor afterwards the band just walked off the stage and drank with the crowd.$LABEL$5
Great hotel. Good service$LABEL$4
Clean and in a great location$LABEL$2
Ive stayed here about 6 times over the past 4-5 years.  This trip was 3 nights$LABEL$1
Room was very small$LABEL$1
Overall - do not ever stay here if you can avoid it.  I will be posting this review to Hotels.com as well to try and help other travelers.  Read on for details.I got put here by US Airways after my flight was cancelled due to 'aircraft maintenance' and after the attendant apologized for having no other choice but this Microtel$LABEL$1
My 4 friends and I were in Charlotte NC and our flight was cancelled which then made us miss our connecting flight back to LAX. They set us all up in a hotel not too far from the airport so that was great...until we read the yelp reviews that the place is stinky$LABEL$1
This place is the nastiest hotel that I have ever encountered! Stuck because our flight was cancelled and all other hotels near the airport were full or really overpriced$LABEL$1
The lady at the front desk was friendly and helpful. The shuttle drivers were also courteous and efficient. Free Internet and local phone service were nice. Basic breakfast - just bagels$LABEL$2
Fried Okra and Sweet Sweet Tea!  That's all you really need to know$LABEL$4
Great Gyros! Its a hidden secret. Yum! Cheap prices too.$LABEL$5
Use to go here all the time for lunch. Always crowded at lunch time. Everyone that worked there was very friendly.  Had good fish sandwiches$LABEL$4
They have one of the best fried chicken sandwiches I have ever had.  I was blocked in traffic due to the president taking off at the airport$LABEL$4
This is one of those local hidden gems.  Could the walls use a painting?  Probably.  Could the interior be slightly updated?  Probably.  Does any of it matter?  Probably not.  The sanitation grade was 96.  The food is cheap$LABEL$4
I've lived down the street from Mr Gs for almost six years. Good gyros and cheap. Sadly$LABEL$3
Never even heard of this place$LABEL$4
Terrible! I'm just now getting over this horrible stomach bug caused by his place. I ended up paying $10.92 for a salad$LABEL$1
This is a well kept secret$LABEL$4
Just say no. It's smoky$LABEL$1
This place is huge and spacious$LABEL$3
I\""m writing this review frooooom the fuuuutuuurreeeee.Coyote Joe's is a big country bar and by big I mean huge. Large dance floor. Multiple bars and more cornhole than you can shake a stick at. It's not really my scene but it's quite cheap so yay!$LABEL$3
Wow$LABEL$4
Food was mediocre at best$LABEL$2
From the moment you walk in they make you feel like your home. Very welcoming staff$LABEL$2
OM to the Mofo G! This Place Is In the Airport$LABEL$5
(2.5 stars)I haven't had Bojangles since the early-mid 1990s when I was on vacation in the South.  Bojangles is a fried chicken chain in the Southeast region that would be similar in style and menu to a Popeyes.Connecting through the Charlotte Airport on my way back to LA$LABEL$3
we are familiar with Popey's (West coast version of this restaurant) so we thought$LABEL$1
We stopped at a Bojangles off Rte 95 in South Carolina on the way back from the Orange Bowl. Just as yummy as the other times. Boy$LABEL$4
First time$LABEL$1
So the one rule about Waffle House - don't order and eat the waffles.Trust me.I played it safe with a ham & cheese omlette$LABEL$2
Came to this location late at night and was greeted by the friendly staff. Very affordable prices and good food! They even have a dollar menu! I would come back!$LABEL$3
Waffle House is Waffle House so no detailed review here. Only$LABEL$2
I give 4 stars$LABEL$4
It's in the ghetto$LABEL$4
I didn't buy anything here$LABEL$3
Went in today for a kitty-cat laceration repair$LABEL$5
VERY good aviary vet! I took my single hood blue fronted amazon to get wings$LABEL$5
Let's face it- it's a Wendy's.  You know what the menu is$LABEL$1
This is the worst Wendy's I've been too !!!The food comes out nasty looking$LABEL$1
Ok$LABEL$1
Along Wilkinson Boulevard there are a couple of these old drive-in restaurants left.  The Bar-B-Q King serves a large variety of food$LABEL$2
I have eaten at BBQ King for over 10 years. They are the best! My Favorite is the BBQ Plate. I substitute Onion Rings for the French Fries that normally come on the plate. The rings are always good and crispy$LABEL$5
Having grown up in North Carolina$LABEL$1
I wish Yelp offered half stars.After trying many acclaimed restaurants featured on the food network$LABEL$3
Classic American food in an old fashioned drive-in setting. Although I'm not a burger person$LABEL$2
We were really excited to be visiting Charlotte after seeing this place on the Food Network's \""Diners$LABEL$3
CASH ONLYGreat dive place.  Heart attack on a plate.  Lotsa of tasty greasy fattening food.  Loved the chicken bbq and the onion rings.  If you are into  Americana$LABEL$5
The food here used to be good$LABEL$1
I finally got around to trying Bar-B-Q King.  The weather was pretty nice so it was a good day for a drive in.  I always try to keep an open mind when eating at a place for the first time which can be tough after reading reviews about the place.  I ordered BBQ plate which comes with 2 sides.  I got fries and slaw.  My visit was on a Saturday between noon and 1 pm.  The place seemed pretty busy with about 50% of the stalls occupied.  It took a little while to get my food$LABEL$2
Saw it on Triple D$LABEL$2
Don't be deceived by Guy Fieri.  He does not know everything.  I$LABEL$2
Not the worlds greatest BBQ chicken (sorry Guy). It was good. Very vinegary. Second price got soggy and the crust is only good when crisp. If I am back down in that area I will try the regular fried chicken.One thing that really bothered me what the car hop hovering for a tip.$LABEL$2
I moved to Charlotte several years ago$LABEL$3
Not as good as I expected. The food was ok but not crazily yummy like shown on triple Ds$LABEL$2
The food was greasy. BBQ sauce wasn't good at all. I went to try out their restaurant because the food looked good on triple Ds. Turned out the food wasn't worth the drive$LABEL$1
BBQ chicken. Best in Charlotte. Bring a bib---or turn your cape around.$LABEL$5
The popcorn shrimp was good. The pulled pork sandwich lacked sauce. It is beyond me why they don't add sauce to the sandwich. We were all fans of the fried bbq chicken.  It is soft$LABEL$4
Great historic place here$LABEL$4
You get 1 star instead of two because the dude that brought us our food to our car$LABEL$1
Looking at some of the other reviews$LABEL$3
While I love the idea of a drive-in in theory$LABEL$4
If you crave some greasey spoon food at a drive-in style spot not near anything$LABEL$3
I'm leaving California and moving into the parking lot.$LABEL$5
This was$LABEL$4
My Ist time experience was GOOD! Visiting Charlotte for the 2nd time and I made this place a must stop after seeing it featured on the Food Network a few years a go. Saw a few folk carrying boxes to go$LABEL$3
I sought out Bar-B-Q King after seeing it on Triple D$LABEL$2
The BBQ chicken was very tasty. The fries$LABEL$3
Decided to give BBQ King a try after seeing it on Diners Drive-Ins and Dives. I was really wanting to like this place. It looked cool on the show and the fried BBQ chicken was supposed to be the best. Complete failure the moment we arrived. I pressed the button on the 1950s speaker system to order and the lady snapped on the other side was about as rude as rude gets. \""I can't hear you\"" in a rude hateful voice. I wondered if I was in Charlotte or NYC. I had to contain myself from pulling her through that speaker system. Wow lady$LABEL$2
Visited 'cause Fieri featured BBQ King on both DDD and Best Thing I Ever Ate.  Really?  Like other reviewers stated$LABEL$3
Not sure if this is the right listing for AT&T residential service but their internet via the new U-verse system isn't any faster$LABEL$1
AT&T UVerse has the WORST customer service..that is IF you can figure out how to communicate with anyone.   Their website is horrible$LABEL$1
Ditto the other ratings for UVerse customer service$LABEL$1
So frustrated with AT&T's horrible service! AT&T was so bad$LABEL$1
I hit this place up since this place was a local spot and I always wanted to see if it was one of those \""hole in the wall\"" type of places. Yes$LABEL$2
I stood waiting behind another customer and watched a roach climb along the pass through that connects the kitchen to the ordering area.No thanks. You can cancel my order.2013 #181 / 365$LABEL$1
We stayed here on the first night of our honeymoon$LABEL$3
I made an appointment because I had an terrible$LABEL$2
Be prepared to wait. We were told to be here at 11:15 for an 11:40 appointment. Coming up on an hour wait$LABEL$2
I went there for an annual eye exam with Dr. Atlas and experienced some of the worst customer service I've ever seen at a doctors office. The receptionist who checked me in did not know how to properly do it$LABEL$1
I heart Modern Salon.An amazing value - got a great haircut and a relaxing (didn't realize that was possible) eyebrow wax here yesterday... only $65!  Lesley gave me the exact haircut I was looking for$LABEL$5
I got my hair cut here about a month ago. During the shampooing my scalp began to feel a little tingly but no biggie. By the time I sat in the stylist's chair though it felt as if my scalp was on fire. My ears were bright red and anywhere else that the wet hair had touched my face turned the skin bright red. Clearly I was having a bad reaction to their Aveda-only products.  The stylist got very concerned and$LABEL$1
I've been getting my haircut here once a month for the past 10 months. I'm very happy. Prior to coming here I went to salon Cielo in the mall and occasionally would go to barbershops depending on what style I was going for. I love the atmosphere in there and the staff is super friendly. Megan is the stylist that I regularly go to. I definitely recommend her for haircuts$LABEL$5
I've been a client at Modern probably a dozen times over the past few years. This was my first appointment with Kris A. I requested a Junior Stylist$LABEL$2
In my opinion$LABEL$3
For those of you without kids$LABEL$3
Slow unfriendly service. Desert area of buffet was never stocked and was dirty.  I ordered the wings and the wings were TINY.$LABEL$2
I wouldn't normally review a McDonald's on this site because...well$LABEL$5
I can count on one hand how many times I go to a fast food restaurant within a year and you can almost bet it equals late night and alcohol. Last night was no different.  MickeyD's was calling my name.  I stopped at the one on Fairview Road.  Service was fast and pleasant.  My french fries were so hot I couldn't eat them right away.  Le Big Mac was the perfect amount of gooeyness from the special sauce and I don't know what their secret is for fountain drinks$LABEL$4
I used to like this Mcdonald's location. But recently getting really disgusting. A lot of flies are flying around. Their floor is sticky. Tables and chairs are always nasty. It's really turned me off. I didn't get anything there!$LABEL$1
The inside is what sets this McDonald's apart. No point talking about the food$LABEL$3
This is a five star McDonalds so to speak. There's a baby grand player piano and an upstairs with tv. However the service and food quality are standard run of the mill McDs. I'm writing this from the upstairs after buying my daughter a happy meal. Her fries are cold as are the nuggets. The sprite is all soda no syrup. I got a small choco shake which was barely mixed. I think it's actually vanilla. Not fatal errors but either they're short handed or they just don't take pride in their job. Hope this is just a fluke.$LABEL$1
This is a McDonald's that makes me want to put my pinky up in the air when dunking chicken mcnuggets into various sauces.  First of all$LABEL$4
Decent McDonalds. Definitely better than the one in Houston that I used to go to and wrote a complaint on them for being consistently negligent. I like this one and its a keeper! Place - two stories and for the most part$LABEL$4
The restaurant is clean but that is the nicest thing I can say about it.  The food was horrible both times I ate there in the past two weeks!  I talked to the manager after the first time who acted concerned but less than a week later the food was still horrible!!!!  Fries were cooked in old nasty grease( taste like everything but fries) and the burger was not done or hot!!!!!!!!!!!!$LABEL$1
McDonald's is McDonald's there's  nothing really special to say. Quick cheap food with a tolerable customer service. What's not to love?$LABEL$2
I love this McDonald's. They are always so kind and care about their customers. One day this Spanish woman accidentally gave me breakfast burritos instead of my sandwich. When I came back she realize exactly what happened and quickly traded them out. Today when I came$LABEL$5
I've never really regretted choosing to go to a fast food place$LABEL$2
For the inside dining experience$LABEL$2
New$LABEL$1
I hate to give this BK a 2-star review - I really$LABEL$2
I was visiting Charlotte this weekend$LABEL$3
This place was pretty good. It feels like TGIF's or Applebee's but luckily it tastes  better. The chicken tenders were different but the two sauces it came with$LABEL$4
We are regulars at Harper's$LABEL$4
What a nonevent. I went there for lunch$LABEL$2
Dry chicken$LABEL$2
Small menu$LABEL$3
Rather standard over all. They do have a very large wine pour at the bar. It gets very busy$LABEL$2
Before heading home after our ski trip. I decided to stop by and hang out since my home girl/cousin works as a bartender here. So she got me the street side tacos for me to munch on. It was bland$LABEL$2
First$LABEL$2
First time going had a HORRIBLE wait time during lunch... The manager comped my food$LABEL$2
Long ago$LABEL$2
Like the food but the overall experience here isn't as good as the one in Columbia$LABEL$3
Not bad but over priced for what you get. I have only been 2x's within a year and was a little disappointed. I went for lunch last April and it was hard to find something light on the menu. I just went for dinner and ordered the honey mustard glazed salmon. It was ok but nothing special for $20.00. Probably would not go again.$LABEL$2
Average food with a few exceptions. Above average prices.  Waiter was excellent (Darius)$LABEL$3
harper's reminds me of a kid who consistently gets \""A's\$LABEL$3
Sorry$LABEL$1
Went to Harper's yesterday to eat$LABEL$1
I have visited Harper's a few times in the past two years. The restaurant is clean and inviting. The atmosphere is warm and personable$LABEL$2
This use to be the go to place because the food was always consistent.  I hadn't been in about 2 yrs though due to the quality/service had dropped.  So this weekend I was in the area and decided to give it another try.  I had the Ahi Tuna.  The tuna itself was good but the noodle salad had a strange  taste$LABEL$2
More like 2 1/2 stars for the priceA few years back whenever I was in town I'd have at least one meal at Harper's in South Park. The place always feels extremely comfortable to me$LABEL$2
Went to Harper's this past Tuesday$LABEL$1
Service is great. Food is average. Outside seating is lovely when the weather is nice however$LABEL$3
Service is excellent.  Every time.  Food is just ok.  The brisket is totally juicy and fabulous but everything else I have had there is just ok.  They have a gluten free menu which is nice.  Honestly though I just go back because its convenient$LABEL$3
Stopped in here for a business lunch. A bit loud but still was able to speak clearly.  Ordered up some shrimp tacos.  Was warned they had a bit of a kick. They did and they were good!  Really enjoyed them.  Service was dead on too.  Def a place I would go back to again if I was in the area.$LABEL$5
I like it here. My wife and I have been here a number of times. Our first visit we were pleasantly surprised with it being trivia night. The past few times we've gone for dinner and once for Sunday brunch. I like the food here a lot. I'm partial to the prime rib (my wife is too) and the chicken and waffles were nice for brunch. The restaurant is pretty clean and the venue itself has a typical American restaurant dining room vibe. Our service is usually good$LABEL$3
Very friendly staff. Nice selection and food was good. Great for a casual lunch or dinner!$LABEL$4
I haven't been to Harper's in YEARS!  I was a little reluctant when some friends suggested Harper's but I decided to go with the flow and unfortunately$LABEL$3
This particular location is pretty hit or miss. I am still nostalgic about the old location on Woodlawn and the quality of the food. Just isn't the same$LABEL$2
I LOVE LOVE LOVE the chicken supremes! SOOO Good! I also love the sweet potato fries. My husbands favorite is the penne pasta dish with the sausage. It is really tasty.  Great place. I highly recommend!$LABEL$5
I was pleasantly surprised by Harper's! I was thinking it'd be like a cross between Chili's and Applebee's...you know$LABEL$4
Well it was girl's night out and we all wanted to try somewhere different. Harper's had a very cool vibe. It has the open kitchen$LABEL$3
2 stars only because the service was good.  Food sucked.$LABEL$2
Having had lunch here for quite some time during my time working on this side of town$LABEL$4
I was not pleased with the service that I received and I was not satisfied with the value. I highly prefer the Pineville location.$LABEL$2
This is a Charlotte Staple. Their menu is timeless as is their history in the South park area.  Yes but try telling that to the hostess who greets you by chewing gum and texting on her phone.   Yeah$LABEL$1
I have been going to Harper's for years - YEARS$LABEL$2
I went here for lunch and it was okay.  I would have given it two stars$LABEL$3
I lost my IPAD.Where could it be?Retracing my steps after I arrived in Raleigh I thought to call Harper's in Charlotte where I had lunch the day before. Apparently I had let my IPAD slip from my bag and I left it in the booth where I had dined. Thanks to the honest wait staff it was returned to the managers who I contacted and had the pleasure of speaking with Curtis Stevenson who took down my address and promptly mailed it back to me.I appreciate Curtis taking the time to return my valuable tool to me immediately.He understood my needs and took fantastic care of his customer.Thanks Harper's and especially Curtis Stevenson!$LABEL$5
Used to be our staple$LABEL$1
The fajitas were delicious!$LABEL$5
My wife and I have been dining at Harpers Southpark for over ten years. They once had the best patio in south Charlotte. No longer; first$LABEL$2
I don't know why I continue to come here.  The food is decent but it takes so friggin ' long to arrive.  My lunch break is an hour.  I spend about half of it waiting for my food to arrive.  It's a sandwich$LABEL$2
I had the worst service at Harpers tonight. Service was lousy and indicative of how the service and food selections continue to slip.  I dine here frequently and tonight was a real DISAPPOINTMENT!$LABEL$1
The food was pretty good/decent$LABEL$2
I give it three stars based on the service not the food. Came in a Friday before the lunch crowd and sat at the bar for a quick bite to eat. Took several minutes for the bartender to breakaway from a conversation with other servers to acknowledge I had sat down. That's pretty much how the meal went - bartender more interested in chatting with other staff or texting on phone. Food was great. Had a simple club sandwich. That was fast to arrive at the table and was cheap.$LABEL$3
I've been coming here for years. Great service. Great atmosphere. Across from SouthPark mall. Perfect for a date. Great food. Except to be honest$LABEL$4
Harper's. Great place. Good food. Knowledgeable staff. Had the Cajun omelet for lunch on Mother's Day Big crowd$LABEL$5
I went to this restaurant recently for dinner.  Service was bad overall with the food being fair.  The crab cakes were dry along with the pizza crust being burnt.  Took forever for the food.  Will probably not return here.$LABEL$2
Usually there for lunch and the food used to be great.  Quality has went down as the price went up. Not worth going so much anymore.  Made the mistake of accidentally walking thru the kitchen and the manager was using language that was highly inappropriate.  Along with seeing all the cooks in the kitchen plating cooked prepared food and not one of them had on gloves.  That's highly disgusting.  Would never return if it wasn't close and had to bring clients there.  Will strongly be looking for a new lunch meeting spot.$LABEL$2
Was there with an international group of colleagues recently.  I was very unimpressed. Humus dip that had far too much cumin in it. Soggy chips with a good steak. A double espresso that smelled and tasted more like the last bit of coffee that had been sitting in the thermos all day (which it probably was). Don't go there$LABEL$1
They are very good with gluten free$LABEL$2
Came here for brunch one day$LABEL$1
Is it me or does the customer service suck?  I've worked as a bank teller before and we always did what we could to expediate the lines and cater to the customers.  This place seems like the opposite.  I've waited on line for 15 minutes when there were three people in front of me.  I'm sorry$LABEL$2
So Bank of america website is totally broken. That is not the worst problem. If you thinking openning an account -- run while you can and save your soul. I have explained to the customer service 50 times yes$LABEL$1
Very good for breakfast.  Good food for an excellent price.  Many regulars that make you feel like you are at a family .$LABEL$4
I'm not sure how I miss reviewing this place! They have the best beef stroganoff! The beef is so tender and the noodles are so buttery. It just melts in your mouth!  :) It is only served on Mondays! The service is always great and the staff and owner is very welcoming and inviting. Their breakfast here is also pretty decent.$LABEL$4
I grew up around the corner from Rusty's and I've been going here for as long as I can remember. You walk in and they've got a nice selection of canned and bottled beverages - including beer. Then you walk up and order from the guy in the kitchen. I usually get a chicken salad sandwich - so good - but today I tried the black bean burger and it was really good. It had salsa and cheddar cheese on top$LABEL$5
Awesome bacon cheeseburger!!! The people at Rusty's treat you right all the time$LABEL$5
This place is GREAT if you're looking for a tasty$LABEL$4
The food is pretty good - they have a great burger - however my girlfriend found a twist tie in her food so she'll never go back.$LABEL$3
The chicken salad is made with turkey.  If they lie about that what else are they lying about.  The food is good and fairly priced.  I also like the salad that they have.  If i am in the area and hungry I would probably visit this place again.$LABEL$2
I like Rusty's deli - the food has always been fresh and tastes great.  It is a Charlotte institution & I remember going back in the 80s.  However$LABEL$3
Good chicken salad$LABEL$3
I ordered a cheesesteak$LABEL$2
I have driven by Rusty's several times and always wondered what the food was like- now I know. I read the reviews on Yelp like I always do and they were mixed. But I figured why not maybe they ordered the wrong thing. Plus$LABEL$2
Rusty's is the kind of diner/hole in the wall joint that always serves consistency. The menu isn't ground breaking. They're not going for a Michelin Star here and the goal is to serve good$LABEL$4
YUM. Great burgers. Also$LABEL$4
What a great lunch spot. A nice selection and great service. We enjoyed the turkey club$LABEL$4
Tasty sandwich. I gave 3 stars only because I drove 45 minutes to try their sandwich. The sandwich while tasty did not impress me to worth the long drive.$LABEL$3
Best philly cheese steak I have come across in Charlotte. If you want an easy$LABEL$4
Lunch with Mrs. K. who really wanted a New York Jewish deli but we didn't want to drive all the way to Arboretum today. Instead$LABEL$3
Great little hole-in-the-wall type place. Sandwiches are wonderful$LABEL$4
I had a slow leak in my rear driver side tire so I went to Firestone on a Saturday around 4:00pm. I was out of there within 40 minutes with the problem solved. All of the employees were very courteous... not just with me but with everyone else that came in there. I'm out $100 but at least I'm not out of patience.$LABEL$4
HORRIBLE.  I ordered a piece of furniture in September that was supposed to take six weeks to deliver.  It is Christmas and I still don't have it.  They don't answer phone calls or emails in a timely fashion  or at all.  I can't cancel or they will charge me $300 restocking fee and delivery.  What a joke.  Thanksgiving and Christmas ruined by these jerks because I have no seating.  NEVER AGAIN$LABEL$1
Now$LABEL$4
I had a great experience buying my furniture from them BUT if you need any service after the purchase good luck.  3 phone calls and 2 emails later and I still haven't received any help.  I spent about $10K with them and just need a contact number to get a motor replaced on one of my Theater seats purchased through them that is not covered under warranty.  NO HELP at all.  Be careful if you need any warranty work or service after the fact$LABEL$2
The people are so snippy who work there. But$LABEL$3
We have been so impressed with the staff here.  They are always prompt in responding to our service requests.  The two service guys that work here currently are very professional$LABEL$5
We've been here 2.5 years.  At first$LABEL$1
Yeah this place is horrible. I've been here for just under 2 years and I wish I was able to have moved out before I renewed my lease. The previous staff was alright. At least they were decent to talk to and understanding about day to day happenings. the new management team in the office now are cunts and have no sense of urgency or how to run a business. Because the rent payment process is for the most part automated$LABEL$1
Willow Ridge Apartments are a great value for the money. We have a 2 BR/2BA for $639$LABEL$3
My friend leased an apartment at this prison facility in the winter of 2010. Immediately upon moving in he noticed a leak in the bedroom that caused the room to flood every time it rained. It was apparent that the leak had been there for quite some time and that they had leased the apartment knowing about the issue. Requests to be moved to another apartment$LABEL$1
Meh$LABEL$2
OK ...the truth will set you free......(deep breath)This is one of my usual stops$LABEL$2
This place is very close to my work$LABEL$1
Generic$LABEL$3
Burritos deluxe. Nicely done. The interesting thing is that the salsa and the other dipping sauce the give you with your chips. The salsa looks horrible but is actually really good and spicy. The other dip was good$LABEL$3
First time visting this place.  Ordered the burrito with chicken ( had to pay extra 25 cents thought that was different and beef taco.  I was disappointed after reading all the positive reviews.  The chicken and beef had no seasoning that I could taste at all.The refried beans was like sauce.  Well the service was fine.  I was hoping for more.$LABEL$2
Three of our five meals$LABEL$1
I was really surprised how excellent the food was considering the cheap lunch specials. The waiter was very friendly and the atmosphere was very pleasant and authentic. The only thing missing was a live Mariachi band :-) Didnt get any drinks since it was my lunch break but I hope to come back and try their margaritas one day.$LABEL$4
Brian{Syvrud} was patient$LABEL$5
Most Fun and Relaxing Surgery I have ever experienced!Table-side manner is very important when you could potentially experience pain and possibly pass out!  Dr. Lind and his Assistant had a great sense of Humor while being completely professional and were very careful to help me feel as comfortable as possible!This was a minor operation on the same toe that has undergone a similar surgery by a different Physician$LABEL$5
I went to this practice after experiencing moderate to severe pain in my right ankle. When I made the appointment I told the person booking the appointment that it was related to my ankle (so they would hopefully assign me to a physician that was versed in that area).  When I went for my appointment$LABEL$1
Person answered the phone$LABEL$2
Went to this practice several times and saw Dr. Lind.  We were told that my son needed  an orthotic for planters fascia tis.  We purchased a lower priced orthotic to begin with. The first orthotic failed within a month so we returned and purchased a more expensive orthotic (more than $300) and told it had a 1 year warranty.  Unfortunately$LABEL$1
My daughter was referred here to have an ingrown toenail removed.  The doctor did a fine job$LABEL$1
I was a patient of Dr. Lind.   I was prescribed a medication that needed to be specially made and sent to me and after a week I hadn't received and called and found they never ordered it.  Looked past that and this week had terrible pain in my foot. I called on Monday morning and again Tuesday and didn't receive a call until Wednesday$LABEL$1
When I get sick$LABEL$5
Dr. Hull is great but not great enough to overcome the poor treatment from the business office.  Don't ask for anything out of the ordinary like calling in a mail order script.  They are a well oiled machine and you are truly just a number there.$LABEL$1
My doctor is Jessica Kaiser - she's one hell of a lady.  They have a new online system that you can make appointments and ask for refills with$LABEL$5
Run$LABEL$1
Simply put$LABEL$5
My friends and I were looking for a decent but relatively inexpensive Chinese restaurant and we found it in Taipei South.  We arrived around 730pm and while the place was bustling with patrons$LABEL$3
Pretty disappointed. I was excited to try this place out for a late dinner$LABEL$1
The food and prices are decent but the service could use some work. I felt like this one waitress was very rude. Also$LABEL$2
A fellow passenger on us air recommended this restaruant$LABEL$3
This place is a testament to the power of word-of-mouth. So much so that by writing this review I feel like just one more voice added to a cacophony of praise for this place. I've been familiar with Taipei South for about 8 years now and I've never once seen or heard any advertisement for the place anywhere. It's just not needed. Even with the terrible location the place thrives.And for good reason. The food is always good and plentiful (best eggrolls in town). The service is always quick. The staff is back to fill your drink while it's still half full. And all this for the price of a fast food meal.I left that part of town about 3 years ago but still go back probably once a month. I just haven't been able to find a Chinese restaurant in center city that lives up to it. They're all either not as good$LABEL$4
First of all$LABEL$4
1. $10 or less dinner prices2. Garlic Beef with Eggplants3. Chicken wings as a side item..ENOUGH SAID!This my go to place when I want good$LABEL$4
If you are into American Chinese food$LABEL$4
Best Chinese food I've had in nc since moving from NYC. I can at least eat it without saying omg I just wasted money$LABEL$4
I was a loyal customer for many years$LABEL$1
We eat here at least twice a week. You can't beat the low prices and good quality of food. I generally don't like Chinese....I prefer Thai but their food is so flavorful. I love the chicken with garlic sauce with chicken wings. I know it sounds crazy but the wings are good.$LABEL$5
Alright$LABEL$2
Decent food.. there was too much sauce$LABEL$3
We have been coming here for many years.  The food is always great and the service is fast.$LABEL$5
This place has the unfortunate distinction of serving up the worst toro I've ever had--instead of butter$LABEL$3
I figure I'd add to this review too$LABEL$5
Mixed review. I was expecting more$LABEL$3
Family went to Mizuho and found that it was closed (7/11/10)! This was a huge letdown - seems another sushi restaurant with a different name is taking its place - will just have to wait and see how it turns out.Anyway we went to Musashi as a second choice and it was not nearly as nice as Mizuho. Atmosphere is cluttered and tables are too close together for any privacy. I ordered Sushi Deluxe$LABEL$2
Upfront disclosures:I am a sushi snob$LABEL$2
First of all it must be said that this is a JAPANESE-style sushi house. If you are new to sushi or the Japanese culture$LABEL$5
FINALLY$LABEL$5
This place is literally a hole in the wall.  The sanitation score reflects this as well with a piping 92%.  Regardless$LABEL$3
I've heard this restaurant from listening to NPR in Charlotte$LABEL$2
I have been going here for too many years to count$LABEL$5
Worst restaurant I have eaten at in a very long time.  I do not understand why this place has any stars at all.They were out of basic sushi$LABEL$1
This is the only authentic Japanese place in Charlotte. I lived in Japan for 3 years and I can tell you first hand this is a close as it gets without spending $2000 for airfare! The food is awesome. The people are awesome. The place rocks!To all the people giving this place 3 stars and complaining that the chicken was not great and the salad should have had ginger dressing.....this is an authentic Japanese restaurant. Not the American Hibachi down the street. Japanese is not a big room with large grills with guys flinging food all over the place creating small fires. That is an American Invention and THIS is what Japanese food tastes like and how it is served. But then again American Stupidity on what other cultures food tastes like knows no bounds....TACO BELL?The service is slower because you are supposed to talk to each other and enjoy your company and not scarf down your food like a couple of baka gaijin. It's Japanese!Again hands down the best place in Charlotte to get authentic JAPANESE FOOD like it is served in Japan in every small town and small food/bar in the country. This is NOT American style Japanese it's AUTHENTIC!$LABEL$5
This place has delicious$LABEL$4
I had high hopes for this place after a friend said it was a well known gem with the Japanese in Charlotte. I enjoy restaurants that are run and frequented by people who know the food well. My friend and I came here on a Thursday night around 8:30pm and were the only souls in the place. Let me also say how hard it was to find this place. Granted$LABEL$3
I think my expectations were a little to high on this one. I was looking for some good ramen and decided to drive across town to Musashi. Unfortunately$LABEL$3
I would say this place was just okay for me. Nothing to amazing$LABEL$2
Authentic Japanese food in an otherwise nondescript location. Fresh and generously sliced sashimi$LABEL$5
Arrived$LABEL$1
I asked the cashier at Hatoya for an authentic Japanese restaurant$LABEL$3
I hate to give a bad review on a rare restaurant that's actually run by Japanese people (apparently)$LABEL$2
Husband was craving Chicken Teriyaki & gyoza$LABEL$2
Reman was ok$LABEL$2
A group of friends and I had a great time at Musashi.  We were in the elevated room with floor seating.  I have not had traditional ramen soup before - it was great!  I think we were probably a little much for the typical crowd there so maybe don't show up with a ton of bros in tow.$LABEL$5
I used to like Musashi back in the days I lived in Charlotte. My Japanese teachers would tell me to go here and a lot of people who knew about the culture would recommend here. I remember my first time at Musashi I saw the most Japanese people in Charlotte ever and I started to believe that it must be the closest one to have the authentic taste.Well so from my old memories I visited again with my mom but only to prove myself wrong.The lady wasn't so friendly but I don't mind she was like that all the time. We sat ourselves at the bar and ordered a spider roll and another roll I don't remember$LABEL$3
I have eaten sushi all over the US$LABEL$5
This is my local pharmacy and I must admit I\""m not very impressed.  They either give me the wrong amount of my prescription or they forget to list whether there are refills or not.  I'd suggest to check everything before you leave the store.$LABEL$2
Looks like very other cvs. The store is the only reason they get two stars. Unfortunately I usually come here for the pharmacy. They are so slow and are not any help. If it wasn't for the convenience of it being next to my dr I would never come here.$LABEL$2
The staff is rude$LABEL$1
Friendly staff$LABEL$4
I lived there for 12 months last year$LABEL$2
Don't move here this place is horrible! The only thing it has going for it is that it looks pretty... There is something always wrong with the apartment. I would not ever recommend this place to anyone!$LABEL$1
I moved here in Aug. found these apts in a hurry. HUGH MISTAKE!!!! They have \""lost my security deposit\""!!!!! Say they never received it$LABEL$1
I've lived at Alexander Place for almost two years.The location of the complex$LABEL$2
We love Dean and Deluca and head there often$LABEL$3
Ah$LABEL$3
If you're used to the \""right coast\"" or \""left coast\"" locations of this place$LABEL$2
When I moved here$LABEL$3
An ode to my dear Dean & Deluca$LABEL$4
A little too pricey sandwich-wise$LABEL$3
Sigh. I love your food.  But your prices are insane in the membrane. $6 for a tin of gummy bears I can find at the gas station for 50 cents? Hmm...I must be paying for the tin and the D&D sticker.  The salads are super fresh with premium ingredients.  The field greens$LABEL$3
I hate to have to do this but I had such an awful experience today!  I visit the Uptown location so I had high hopes$LABEL$1
This Dean & Deluca makes a soup right. Soup Nazi style! Regardless of the time of day$LABEL$4
Love D&D but not the prices! Wait till Whole Foods Market arrives area markets will really be hit. D&D will have to make some changes.$LABEL$3
\""WOW$LABEL$1
I love Dean and Deluca in theory$LABEL$3
Consumer Fraud part IIYes their selection of cold cuts$LABEL$1
Oh how I've missed you! They didn't have D&D where I moved from and I absolutely love this place. Its fun to come have lunch$LABEL$5
I don't know if I would ever shop here again after buying a bag of chips for about $12$LABEL$3
This place is expensive.  Really expensive.  Expect everything thing here to be \""boutique\"" quality and that means you're going to pay out the nose.  $80/lb of chocolate.  $12 snacks.  $6 coffee.Now if you ignore price$LABEL$2
Great upscale selection. Desserts$LABEL$4
Since I've embarrassed them into stopping the OJ scam I'm updating the review. Two stars because they still charge the same NY style price is no object in Charlotte. Medium cup of tomato soup : $7 don't expect a roll. Prices are for the most part above reach$LABEL$2
Sandwich with a side of pretension? No$LABEL$2
I had such a good experience today in Dean and Deluca. A super friendly employee chatted me up while he was dishing out my favorite tomato and mozzarella side dish. He was extremely polite and engaging. The exchange made me feel like I was a regular and I left the store feeling extremely positive. I'm a huge fan of business that hire people with engaging smiles and friendly dispositions. Having said that$LABEL$4
I think this place is decent considering I live within walking distance away from the restaurant but I would imagine better quality from a place priced as high as this.  Their sandwiches are nice$LABEL$3
My favorite place to get a coffee.  Nice and clean with delicious (if overpriced) desserts.$LABEL$4
I don't have a problem paying high prices as long as the quality lives up to the pricing. D&D is expensive. However$LABEL$1
We stopped by after a movie matinee. The atmosphere is nice and the food is good$LABEL$3
North Carolina has 3 D & D and Chicago has zero? I love the grocery store attached to this place If I didn't just go nuts at Dillard's$LABEL$5
A friend here said you must go here. Well that was some good advice. Nice size bar and plenty of tables spread throughout. Atmosphere very nice$LABEL$5
Yeah$LABEL$5
I love to eat here and pick up specialty grocery items too. Their tuna salad with lemon zest in it is fab and so is the rotisserie chicken salad. My kids love to make custom sandwiches at the sandwich bar. I've never had anything here that wasn't delicious. It's trendy$LABEL$5
Good Irish cream latte though I will say I have been to this location twice and neither time were they friendly.  So watch out for the chill in the air.  The seating outside is beautiful with the water fountain right in front of it.  I have yet to try their food but the location is south park is much better!$LABEL$3
I always stop in for a delicious sandwich before a movie. But$LABEL$2
Overly expensiveOK$LABEL$2
I try to stop by D&D during my Charlotte business trips because the selection is super fresh and absolutely delicious.  The price can be high$LABEL$5
So this place is super fancy. And get ready to shell out the $$$ for the average meal or drink. But having said that$LABEL$5
Mixed experience here. Had we just stayed on the market side it would be fine. We bought dessert and a coffee and headed into the wine bar. A server told us to wait for the hostess and the hostess said we made a grave error by attempting to get a table while already having food. They would have to plate the food and pour the coffee into mug since they were a full service side. And that's fine$LABEL$2
Beware!! They didn't even deserve a one star. This company and leasing managers are racist and treat people like they are nothing. All they want is you to sign on the dotted line and they got you! The 1 bedroom apartment we rented was a fucking DUMP when we moved in. The ceiling fan was ready to fall on our heads$LABEL$1
HORRIBLE PLACE TO LIVE!FIRST OF ALL..... these apartments are NOT IN BALLANTYNE!!!!  This place has changed dramatically since I first moved in. It used to be quiet and peaceful. The genius who decided to design some of the apartments to where their bedroom is literally in the hallway of the building....Smh. I can hear EVERY...SINGLE...CONVERSATION that goes on in the hallway. You complain about noisy neighbors...they won't do anything about them. I have called the police multiple times on neighbors fighting$LABEL$1
Nothing had improved. My toilet keeps getting stopped up and you have to call the office multiple times sometimes to get someone to come out. I NOW HAVE ROACHES AND MY APARTMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN SPRAYED ONCE. I'M BEYOND DISGUSTED.$LABEL$1
PF Chang's$LABEL$3
Dead Roach on the Bamboo on my steam dumpling basket. I got up and left. This is the only time i've gotten up and left besides an hour wait at Denny's.  F'ing gross!!$LABEL$1
I visited the PF Chang's in the South Park area recently$LABEL$3
If you're familiar with PF Chang's and their look$LABEL$4
Gluten Free/Allergy SensitiveHuge GF menu with many options for appetizers$LABEL$5
Gross$LABEL$2
The only thing I like during my experience at PF Chang's was the egg drop soup. The steamed rice served looked like the cheapest long grain rice you can find in Walmart. Aside from being uncooked it was dry and loose$LABEL$2
I tried PF Changs for the first time EVER a few weeks ago. Seeing that I love restaurants and Asian food$LABEL$4
So when I moved to Charlotte I would always ask people where the best Chinese restaurant was.  And if you can believe it$LABEL$2
There was a time when I would eat here on a weekly basis.  While there is very little you could term \""authentic cuisine\"" here$LABEL$4
Somehow this one is the lesser of the PF Chang's that I have tried.  Normally PF Chang's is 5 star.  This one seems to try hard but doesn't quite reach the upper ranges than some PF Chang's I have visited.  Take out is a plus$LABEL$3
And the adventure begins to P.F.Changs.......On this adventure$LABEL$2
PF Chang I love your decor$LABEL$2
I visited this location recently with my family$LABEL$4
I've been here a couple of times$LABEL$3
Nice spot.Can't really complain about this chain - great service and solid food.  Showed up here before closing for a some quick grub before knocking out at home.  Had the chicken lettuce wraps and hot'n'sour soup.  Admittedly$LABEL$4
This has to be my favorite place to eat.  The food is always consistent and worth waiting for.  I have never had a bad meal here.  I crave the orange peel shrimp occasionally and have to go get my fix!  Their lettuce wraps are the best around.  I've tried them from other restaurants and they don't hold a candle to PF Chang's.  It is very moderately priced and affordable but the ambiance of the establishment gives you the feel of a more upscale and expensive dining experience.  If you haven't been yet you have to try it!$LABEL$5
I had a horrible experience getting take out from the local PF Changs take out. I had been home and not feeling well the last couple of days craving take out from PF Chang's. I found it the worst food I have ever gotten at from PF Changs in 2 states in the last 10 years. The gallon of \""fresh\"" tea was so syrupy I could not drink it. The vegetarian dish had soggy vegetables and awful tasting curry that I could not eat it. The side order of fried green beans was soft$LABEL$1
Great chinese food is hard to find... so hard to find$LABEL$3
Ok$LABEL$2
Yes it's a chain and serves non authentic Chinese. Yes it is pretty good. Happy hour has some pretty solid deals.$LABEL$3
I love PF Chang's and have since I was little! It seems like some stuff has changed a little bit though. I was disappointed that our lettuce wraps only came with 3 pieces of lettuce$LABEL$4
Had lunch there this past Sunday$LABEL$4
Had lunch.  Everything was good.  Great service.$LABEL$4
come on.... if you want Chinese$LABEL$1
Overpriced faux-Chinese slop for white people.  It's a chain and has the word \""bistro\"" in the name.  Do the math.If you like overly sweet$LABEL$2
We got a lovely gift card from some friends and we decided to use it for our first time here for an Anniversary lunch.  First of all$LABEL$2
Yes$LABEL$4
I know it's a chain$LABEL$4
Not a big fan of American Chinese cuisine$LABEL$4
Decent for a chain$LABEL$3
i found out that portion size is good$LABEL$1
Years ago$LABEL$2
Great experience in previous visit in Orlando so tried this one in Charlotte. Apps were cold.  Waiter was loud and too casual.  Cream curdled in coffee.  Sea bass was steamed spinach coated in soy sauce.  After I have been to all other Charlotte restaurants$LABEL$1
This night was a packed house. It was a Tuesday and we were expecting it to be light but people were waiting outside. thank goodness it was only 2 of us. We had the wonton soup....tasted good. For entree we had the fried rice an mongolian beef. That was great. Now the rice.....humm missing some seasoning this time. The waitress was good. She was a little slow but no biggie. Maybe she had just came off lunch break. We told her about the rice being bland. She had one of the best chefs make us another order to take with us. That was nice. It was good too. We will return...it just depends on the day of the week. It won't be on a Tuesday!$LABEL$3
I love PF Chang's$LABEL$4
Love this place!!! Food is great!!$LABEL$4
Love the food! Amazing server. Egg rolls slightly greasy tho. Long wait but it was Valentine's night. Love the 3 course dinner for 2 they offer.$LABEL$4
This was my first time at PF Chang's I will start buy saying this location in South park is beautiful I love the area.  Parking is rough to come back in the man lot. They do have complementary Valet parking so that is good if you're not waiting for him.  The decor is similar to every other PF Changs similar to a Cheesecake Factory.  It was VERY loud in there we had trouble hearing each other talk on a busy Saturday night.I ordered the Korean BBQ Chicken Stir fry it was pretty good nothing special or amazing but good.  My girlfriend orderd the Honey Chicken was also was good but nothing special.  All in all it you can tell they use quality ingredients in the food but it really is high priced Chinese food in my opinion. Yes I would go back but not in any hurry to go!$LABEL$3
The atmosphere$LABEL$2
Another bad experience two times in a row. There must be a shortage of waitstaff in Charlotte because these people shouldn't even be working at Walmart. Both times we went for lunch and took an hour and a half. They served soup which took almost 40 minutes to get egg drop and it look like low tide in Louisiana. Big chunks of gray and black eggs floating in my egg drop soup$LABEL$1
I ordered take out from this P.F. Chang's on Tuesday night and have to say that is was terrible. Not only I was the food ready 45min later than the time frame they gave me over the phone$LABEL$1
It's good and cheap(in that area).$LABEL$4
Came for lunch$LABEL$2
I hadn't been here in a while and I figured I'd give it a shot since I was out shopping it up... The Kung Pao chicken has always been my go-to$LABEL$2
On a recent trip to Charlotte$LABEL$4
I'll give this HT one star$LABEL$1
Great staff$LABEL$4
It's a really nice Teeter I will say it always seems to be under stocked whenever I go there. But that could be just the day I go is before there truck is in. Staff is friendly and the place is kept clean!$LABEL$3
Over rated would be my first thought on this$LABEL$3
I have been to this restaurant multiple times.  We use Open Table to book reservation on-line$LABEL$4
I don't understand the hype for this place. Service was ok and my filet mignon was SO overcooked and lacked flavor. The only decent part about my meal was the molten chocolate cake. Will not come back.$LABEL$2
Eh$LABEL$2
I've tried it twice and won't be going back.The first was a romantic meal with the wife; decor is an interesting talking point but creates more of a roadside dinner feel rather than the white table cloth experience. Bread was good and service good$LABEL$1
Five star and all star! Ok$LABEL$5
been there 2 times.  it is way overpriced and the service is average.  capital grille is much better.  mortons is better. not a big fan.$LABEL$1
Another fine steakhouse. Another 5 star review. Palm has been on my list for quite some time and C and I finally pulled the trigger last night.  Happy camper would describe us both$LABEL$5
We had another fantastic experience at the Palm recently. This time I tried the blue cheese & bacon burger. It did not disappoint! Once again Holly$LABEL$5
OK... I think I'm sold that Palm is my favorite Steakhouse in Charlotte.  Basically$LABEL$5
Delicious steaks and crab cakes. Excellent waitstaff. Surprisingly good beer selection. I also really like the decor. With all of the caricatures... Personally I try to stay away from the steakhouse chains$LABEL$5
I was very$LABEL$2
Made a visit during Charlotte restaurant week. My first time to the Palm here in Charlotte$LABEL$4
I had a business dinner here tonight with a party of 7. Wonderful meal$LABEL$4
I have heard great things about the Palm and I think it is somewhat of a staple here in Charlotte but I have to say it honestly didn't live up to the hype in my opinion.I think your experience will depend upon your reasoning for choosing this restaurant..For example$LABEL$3
I have been to The Palm in L.A.$LABEL$2
Late afternoon dinner at the Palm... I wanted to leave when we were not received for about 10 minutes$LABEL$2
The Palm's service and responsiveness to guests do not match their high prices.  I dined there on the 23rd with valued clients.  It took 40 to 50 minutes to be served after ordering$LABEL$2
Ok$LABEL$5
Okay so everyone knows what the Palm is.  The steaks are generally really good$LABEL$2
I love a good upscale steakhouse and the palm delivers. I have only eaten here twice and will base my review on the bar service/dining experience alone. I sat at the bar on a Sunday night with Shannon the best bartender. She is so personable and just great at her job.  If you go before 7 any day of the week the bar food is discounted to a very reasonable rate. I tried the lobster roll and the steak sliders. Both pretty delicious. We also tried the beer carpaccio off the regular menu because I love beef carpaccio. A lot. A whole lot. The regular diner menu is a bit pricey but that's to be expected with these types of establishments. The carpaccio was amazing and the arugala salad on top of it was delicious. With the carpaccio I wish they didn't put grated parm on it (I felt it cheapened it-just go with the shaved fresh parm and call it done!) and there were no capers. I am used to having capers on carpaccio but to each his own. For dessert (which I usually skip) I went with Shannon's glowing recommendation of the doughnuts. Oh. My. God. They are hot and fresh and delicious. Rolled in cinnamon sugar they come with two dipping sauces and some whipped cream. These are made for splitting I would assume because there were a lot of holes. But so good. I loved this place and I will be back soon. Hopefully to sit in the dining room or at least give a steak a try!$LABEL$4
Overall an excellent experience. Service is excellent Evan though she never brought me my lemon for my water. When paying over 200 for dinner for 2 I would like my lemon please. Guess I am picky. The steaks were phenomenal but again she reversed our temperature of cooking mine was the way my guest wanted his and his was the way I wanted mine. But still quality meat so no complaints. They do push to pad the bill but I knew it and accepted so shame on me. Will definitely return soon and maybe be a little more assertive. Also did not have my regular waiter so hopefully will get him back. It is a keeper!$LABEL$4
Honestly I'm not sure what the big rave is about this place. My company celebrates International Women's Day and part of it was lunch and the people planning it chose The Palm. They both raved about it etc. So they have this pre-fixed 3 course power lunch menu going on. So most of us chose to do that. Nothing stood out to me... The ceasar salad ehhh I've had WAY better. For the entree had the steak medallions with the fries/onion strings (the side choices are awful!!) and for a steakhouse that was some lame steak.  Desert choices were flourless chocolate cake and cheesecake. I got the chocolate because I love it and even that was rather disappointing but it was the best thing I ate. Truly I felt like I was eating somewhere like Applebee's and their prices do not reflect that. Thankfully it wasn't my tab and I'd never go back. The service was really good for our large group but the restaurant was empty so they didn't have anything else to do.$LABEL$2
Simply put the service is great$LABEL$3
Another Marriott-tastic property$LABEL$4
Good location for a business traveler. There are plenty of restaurant options nearby$LABEL$4
Recently my kids and I stayed in this hotel for one night.  When we first got to the room it was a bit small but we weren't in it that much.  I rated this place a three star because the breakfast was only okay with the service being good.$LABEL$3
Disclaimer: I base this review on lunch only.I have a dream. My dream is that one day ethnic restaurants that modify menu offerings to suit \""American\"" tastes to the degree that people in the restaurant's native country would have difficulty identifying those offerings call themselves \""(fill-in-the-blank)-American\"" restaurants. Thus...Baoding is a good Chinese-American restaurant in the South Park area. Other Yelpers have described it well: it is attractively appointed with comfortable seating and an upscale bar. The service is consistent$LABEL$3
Not impressed with the food. In fact$LABEL$2
The Szechuan Wontons are actually Thai style peanut sauce wontons.  The Kung Pao chicken is completely lacking in spice.  The pork fried rice is their own mild concoction$LABEL$3
3.5 stars after eating dinner there on a Friday night. First$LABEL$3
Honestly$LABEL$3
This is the best Chinese food in Charlotte that I have found. I am a pretty healthy eater$LABEL$4
Took the family last night because many neighbors had suggested it for a meal. OK food$LABEL$2
Since half stars arent part of the rating system$LABEL$3
Ugh... Way overpriced$LABEL$2
I ordered the seafood special under \""Chef Specialties\"" Was supposed to have shrimp$LABEL$1
I ordered the dumplings and pineapple fried rice.I've never had fried rice that was so white-It lacked flavor. The dumplings were just okay. I don't think I will come back here for Chinese food.$LABEL$2
Found myself alone for lunch and remembered the sign outside while visiting 'Moe's'.  Asian grill $5.99. Can't be good$LABEL$5
I've been here 3 times. Once for sit-down dinner$LABEL$3
We were in the area shopping and ended up eating lunch at Baoding.  The food and service was excellent.  The price was reasonable.$LABEL$4
Went here with my In-Laws who were craving good Chinese. So my friends at work recommended Baoding$LABEL$4
THE BEST Chinese in Charlotte.  Hands down.  Great service.  If you are thinking of going to PF Chang's...keep moving down the street to Sharon Corners.  Shopping center is difficult to get in and out of but it is worth it.$LABEL$5
Waited a long time to try this place. Wish I had waited longer.The service was very good; everyone was very polite. However$LABEL$2
Good for kids?  NO!  They don't have high chairs...it was a disaster!!!!!$LABEL$3
If you are a South Park yuppie you will love it. If not stay away. Nuff said.Staff is rude. And they are idiots$LABEL$1
Went last night with a party of five. Had a reservation and table was waiting for us.  The food was good especially the chicken wonton soup. However$LABEL$3
Wish we had half stars as this is a strong three with high potential to be a full four star.  An excellent Chinese restaurant.The shopping center in which it is located is \""in a hole\"" meaning that you have to slide down into their parking lot and shops.  And Baoding is just about exactly opposite one of the entry drives$LABEL$4
This was my first time having dinner at Baoding. My husband and I were regulars at their sister restaurant$LABEL$4
A nice place. I came in with extremely short nails... ok I bite them. I asked the technician if I could get a manicure or do I have to get a full set of nails. She didn't try to upsell me a full set. The place was clean and the staff was friendly. And the price is extremely reasonable. I would totally come back again.$LABEL$4
I've only been here 2x and both times had a pedicure and gel manicure. The first time was okay$LABEL$2
Got a pedicure here today and it was a good experience. The salon is clean and I like that they have curtains between the chairs to give you a little privacy. I also liked that the employees were not chatting across the room to each other in a foreign language. The price for a basic pedicure is $22 if you pay cash and $24 credit. All tips are requested to be cash.My only complaint about the pedicure is I wish the massage lasted longer.$LABEL$4
The Original Pancake House (OPH) is my 2nd favorite place for breakfast on the weekends (Pewter Rose is the first).  And they're one of the few Charlotte brunch options that opens before 10 a.m.  They offer an extensive menu of breakfast selections$LABEL$4
I went to OPH for dinner and decided on the eggs$LABEL$2
OPH was the first restaurant I came to when I moved to Charlotte three years ago and it was exactly what I was expecting from my experience at many other locations. An excellent breakfast served by friendly and knowledgable staff.I've had nearly everything on the menu and it's all excellent. Waffles (yes$LABEL$5
Fresh coffee$LABEL$4
We went on a Saturday morning and had to wait almost an hour to be seated.  My egg white omelette was runny$LABEL$2
This is an alternative to dennys$LABEL$3
Unfortunately$LABEL$1
I do not get it.  Why does this place get voted Best Breakfast?!  We had been once before and the pancakes tasted funky and the eggs tasted fishy.  Tried again today and were again sorely disappointed.  After struggling to piece together a breakfast and being told we couldn't do certain things because \""the computer won't let us$LABEL$1
This place makes me happy$LABEL$3
My favorite place in Charlotte for Strawberry Pancakes!!The fruit is fresh sliced...not sitting in a pre-packaged \""syrup\"" base.The whip cream is made fresh in house and the Kona French Press coffee is a delight! If you are going with the regular's for a mid morning b'fast on a Saturday..plan to wait....a while.$LABEL$4
For under $8 (in South Park$LABEL$4
Long wait$LABEL$3
Really good food. Good service and fairly prompt seating. Had the crepes and the wife had a dutch baby. Both were really tasty. This is our second time here and will definitly come again.$LABEL$4
So I knew this place was going to be good when we came here on a Monday morning and it was packed.  After reading over the menu with what seems like a never ending selection of waffles$LABEL$4
After going here for years$LABEL$2
I honestly don't understand the love the Original Pancake House gets. The fact that their pancakes and their omelets are above-average sized doesn't make them great. In fact$LABEL$2
Original Pancake House's pancakes are great!  The best I've ever had?  No$LABEL$4
We've been to OPH a handful of times over the years and the service and food are always pretty consistent.  My 14 yo son typically gets some type of pancakes (he likes their chocolate chip) and my husband always gets an omelet and we split it because they are enormous!!!  During our recent visit$LABEL$4
Where do I start.  I'm in love with this restaurant for breakfast. Each time I've been there are always a lot of people waiting which makes you think there would be a really long wait$LABEL$4
oph is so good!  anything on the menu is worth trying and the service is always exceptional.$LABEL$5
This is not in Ballantyne$LABEL$3
Pancakes$LABEL$5
I had breakfast here today with my Cousin$LABEL$5
Love this place!  Great food and huge portions. Love to eat here every time we Re in the South park area around breakfast time$LABEL$5
I love this place$LABEL$5
Even the grumpiest of grumps couldn't find anything to complain about here. The breakfast choices are so wonderfully indulgent. I'm dreaming about the baked apple pancake right now. Wait the 20 minutes for it$LABEL$5
What a cool place! It's a winning combo of college dive/local institution and Guy Fieri hangout.The selection of breakfast and some lunch items is vast. Want pancakes? 42 different means of eating it. I haven't seen a Dutch Baby on a menu in ages! It's what would happen if your souffl\u00e9 fell on hard times into a pancake and was working it's way towards turning tricks as a bread pudding. Dense$LABEL$4
The very basics of breakfast nothing extraordinary here. My trip would have been fine except I ordered hash-browns and instead got home fries. To make things worse when I asked the waiter about it she wanted to argue with me about wether hash browns and home fries were the same. Instead she could of said ok would you like something else instead. Oh well$LABEL$2
For casual ware this place is second to none.  They have a wide variety of comfy stuff and cute dresses.  But the real draw is the jeans$LABEL$4
The Poole Shop drew me in from the outside by their bold and funky window display$LABEL$3
They do take walk-ins$LABEL$4
Cute store. For me it's hit or miss- sometimes I find a ton of great things$LABEL$3
Luna held a sale in the Parkroad shopping center last week and I think it is even going through this week.  They are calling it \""Luna Rack\"" as they basically took a big bite off of Nordstrom Rack.  Anyway$LABEL$2
I'm really enjoying my stay here at the Residence Inn.  It feels more like a 1 Bedroom apartment than a hotel.  The staff is friendly and the Breakfast buffet and Manager cocktail hours (M-W) are a huge plus as well.Great place to stay if your gonna be here for more than a few nights.Shout out to Brian at the front desk!$LABEL$4
Bedside Manor is a fantastic bedding store$LABEL$4
I've had mostly good experiences with this particular location$LABEL$3
A nice B&N with books at full retail prices. If you're looking for a recent release or you just like to browse$LABEL$3
I like books. I enjoy reading. I also have a Kindle...so$LABEL$3
Barnes & Noble in Southpark is a great place to plop down for a few minutes and read the newspaper or a few hours and crank out a full day of work. This location isn't too busy. Nice and spread out between two levels and has a spacious coffee bar with plenty of seating. Not too much of a book reader$LABEL$3
Book Stores Still Exist.  I'm Glad.I'm a recovering book geek.  I used to go to places like this and just browse and browse and buy more books than I could ever possibly read in a year.  There just weren't enough hours in the day or days in the week to read everything I wanted.  But with online buying so convenient I hadn't bought a book from a brick and mortar book store in I don't know how long.I was in the area$LABEL$3
It's a big Barnes and Noble fan.  Not tons more to say other than the staff is friendly and I like the two story set up with the children's section upstairs.  As with any Barnes and Noble$LABEL$3
Horrible customer service. The lady working the cs desk is very short and not very helpful when it comes to looking up something (maybe she doesn't know how to use a computer). From now on$LABEL$2
Stopped by before dropping my sister off at the airport. I love killing time in a book store. It's fun to browse the sections and skim through a few pages of books I wouldn't have normally seen since I shop on amazon for most everything in the book world. This location has limited parking$LABEL$3
My favorite place to come for \""dinner.\""  The cafe staff are really friendly.  The parking is a bit tricky and it fills up quickly$LABEL$3
I find it very ironic that the front display at a bookstore is e-readers. Although the multiple varieties of Nooks greeted me at the door$LABEL$3
I special ordered a 2014 calendar from this store and they never called me to tell me it was not available or anything. Once again$LABEL$1
This store is ridiculous. They need to hire way more people. I was upstairs trying to find an employee to help for what it seemed as if it took donkey's years. I finally managed to locate someone who happen to be on the phone with someone else$LABEL$3
Considering I do the majority of my shopping online... it is a little refreshing to go to B&N to actually feel books in your hands and turn actual pages.  It's a little sad really since I remember a time when there used to be more B&N stores in the Charlotte area.  It is crazy how things have changed.This location is pretty convenient to the South Park area.  The parking lot can be a pain-in-the-butt (but usually the problem is that people can't drive).  I once witnessed two ladies almost get into a brawl over a parking space - spoiler alert$LABEL$3
As a whole$LABEL$3
The experience of shopping in this store$LABEL$1
It was good but parking sucks and the chicken looked pink and I asked if it was ok to eat and they said that's just the way the chicken looks. So we will see if I get sick. Also they had problems with their soda machine.$LABEL$2
Showmars has Gyro's$LABEL$3
Great service$LABEL$4
Food was good$LABEL$1
This isn't my favorite Showmars$LABEL$3
We have been going to this Showmars for years and years$LABEL$4
I love this church b/c the pastor is biblically accurate and the worship is very moving and that God is moving in this church. Life groups are awesome and the people are very friendly. God has his hand on this church and seeing it grow the way it has in the past few years is the reason that God has blessed this church.$LABEL$5
I took up fly fishing a while back$LABEL$3
I just ordered a knife from their online store.  It turns out their picture was wrong and I got the wrong blade.  I wrote them and Tiphany immediately sent me a prepaid FedEx label to return the knife and express mailed me a more expensive replacement at no cost.I'm very satisfied with my experience with them.$LABEL$5
Great locally owned store that specializes in all sorts of outdoor gear.  They are very helpful and will be happy to assist you if you need a special order for anything.$LABEL$4
they always do great job! Love this place and all the staff here are friendly!$LABEL$5
Went a second time and did not have a great experience. Sat in a different seat and that seat didn't work as well. Had to tell the lady that my water was too hot and burning my feet$LABEL$2
This used to be a great company to work with. The products were made well and the service used to be outstanding. Now buyer be ware. I have had nothing but headaches with my orders. First was with the drapery order I placed in July. My drapes still are not up because of one debacle after another. First some of the hardware didn't arrive$LABEL$1
The above \""review\"" was$LABEL$5
I have used Alan several times over the past 15 to 20 years. He is a caring and wise individual. I have always been very pleased with the service that Alan provided. If you need to get \""lawyered up\"" for a domestic case$LABEL$5
My dad and his friends would love this place$LABEL$3
When Via Veneto first opened$LABEL$3
Via Veneto has certainly made some changes in the past year or so. While their shoe selection has always been upscale and interesting (Frye$LABEL$4
My first time walking in to a Men's Wearhouse because I needed a black bow tie for going out fast having lost mine somehow. My fashion sensibilities usually keeps me away from these types of stores otherwise. But I managed to get in and out fast which is nice$LABEL$4
So help me God$LABEL$1
I previously went to this location a couple years ago for a tux and had a good experience. A lot of my friends it seems are now getting married. With having four weddings in a few months I decided it was time to get some new suits. I wear a 52 jacket so your box stores were out of the question as they only carry up to 48. With having a good experience previously$LABEL$4
My groomsman and I bought the suits for my wedding here. 4 of us that I know were sized wrong.  Customer service was terrible. After we purchased our suits they would not correct it.  Highly recommend not buying a suit here.  These people do not know what they're doing.$LABEL$1
I drive out here for these reasons:I like me some fake duck.They have an insane wine list$LABEL$3
My first exposure to Upstream was a few years ago at one of those \""taste of\"" events$LABEL$3
Came here to have dessert and coffee one evening after a big night of sushi and wine.  There were five of us and everyone got something different.  Each dessert ran around $10 and the coffee was $6.  The restaurant is very modern and hip - the wait staff seemed pleasant enough.  Looking around I could see this would be a great date place if you were looking to make an impression.  The dessert presentation was uniquely plated.  We all tasted each others desserts - they were all good...creme brulee$LABEL$4
This is definitely one of the pricier restaurants I've ever been to in Charlotte$LABEL$3
Disappointed every time I've gone...won't be trying it anymore!!$LABEL$1
I went here for lunch time.Restaurant Feel - Romantic. The ceiling is pretty intriguing. Service - Timely$LABEL$4
While in Charlotte for business we ventured to upstream for dinner. My company was awkward$LABEL$3
I brought my partner to Upstream for his first visit.  We had a table in the middle of the dining room.  I love the look and decor of Upstream (especially the ceiling!) so this felt very cozy.  The only disturbing thing about it was the noise level.  There's no wall between the cozy dimly lit dining room and the loud blaring kitchen.  I understand (and enjoy!) the concept of \""open kitchen\"" dining$LABEL$4
Came here for restaurant week last July when I was visiting a friend in Charlotte. We were able to get a table outside and had a view of the shopping area. I started off with the cream of crab soup which was okay$LABEL$3
Go on Half Priced Bottle night!I went one night with a friend and had a bottle of Elyse \""Korte Ranch\"" Zin for $35!!! I wanted to take one home$LABEL$4
Absolutely love this place$LABEL$5
My boyfriend and I decided to go see a movie this past Sunday & wanted to grab a few appetizers before heading that way. We walked over to Upstream to check out the menu and immediately loved their options! We headed straight for the bar where we were greeted immediately and requested two waters and two menus. About 5 minutes later we were still without waters or menus & our bartender was nowhere to be seen (there were only about 3 or 4 other people sitting at the bar)...so I had to go to the host stand to look for some. We each ordered the lobster bisque and decided to share the sweet and sour calamari. The lobster bisque came out lukewarm which made it completely unappetizing and had one small piece of lobster in the middle that turned out to be rubbery when we went to eat it!!!We moved on to the calamari which was AMAZING and delicious!!!! Unfortunately$LABEL$1
We had heard great things about this restaurant and were very excited to go.  What a disappointment.  The service was sooo slow.  I think we got water about 10 minutes after being seated. It must have taken another 10-15 minutes for the waiter to show up$LABEL$2
Upstream is one of 3 main restaurants in Phillips Place (PF Chang's & The Palm are the other two). Known for it's seafood and brunch$LABEL$3
we were hoping for more of a sushi restaurant but this is much more of a fish restaurant.  the sushi was good but the nigri was expensive compared to other places we have been.  with all the other choices out there - we probably won't be back.$LABEL$2
Upstream$LABEL$3
Although I am fairly certain that at some point$LABEL$4
Upstream has slipped... both in quality of food and service. Seems to need a 'refresh?' Once the best seafood in Charlotte$LABEL$2
Disappointing. Overly salted entree as well as very salty side of roasted mushrooms.$LABEL$2
Glad we tried this at restaurant week prices.  Didn't realize it was  a \""corporate\"" place until we got our leftovers in  a bag advertising the network of places it was part of.  We had just said the food was decent but soulless$LABEL$2
Let me start off this review by saying:  I got the hook-up for my trip to Upstream.  At the time$LABEL$5
Pretty sub-par brunch and this place is definitely not headed in the right direction.  Came here for Sunday brunch with a coupla buddies.  Was disappointed at the brunch foods available and the service.Food - nothing really stands out$LABEL$2
Upstream is one of the most well-known restaurants in Charlotte. Pretty much a legend in the culinary scene for locals and those visiting on super special business. I'd say this joint lives up to all infamy and certainly delivers on multiple fronts. I love the bar. Big$LABEL$4
Oh upstream how I love thee. Why am I writing yet another update with the same rating as the ones before you ask? So I can tell you about the brunch of course. This brunch is a monster of a buffet and tapas menu combined all for the low price of $25! Hold on you might be balking at the hefty sticker tag on this brunch but let me tell you about all the stuff you can well...stuff yourself with and you'll be singing praises too after you try this joint out.This being one of my last weekends in Charlotte the boyfriend and I went with a yelpy crew consisting of Travis W.$LABEL$5
Went here for brunch on a Sunday morning.  The brunch is a buffet$LABEL$3
5-STAR Brunch!! We've taken all our out of town guests here$LABEL$5
Upstream is just ok. Maybe I got the wrong thing. I ordered sushi$LABEL$3
Phew$LABEL$4
Wow.  All I have to say is order the sea bass.  Period.$LABEL$5
More like Downstream. In town from CA and wanted to try something new. Bad decision. Bad service. Food was bland & ill prepared. What a disappointment.$LABEL$1
I came here a few days ago on a weeknight with 7 other people. We started out with the appetizer tower which came with crab cakes$LABEL$2
Must try the sea bass. This place is on the pricey side$LABEL$4
Yep! This place gets my approval as another solid Sunday afternoon brunch spot! I came Sunday afternoon with about 10 girlfriends. Even with our large party$LABEL$4
Came here for restaurant week$LABEL$4
I live right by here and go a lot. Staff is super friendly$LABEL$5
It had been a while for me and Upstream hanging out together. We had broken up over brunch one Sunday$LABEL$4
It was ok. Parts were good. The sea bass was ok the crab cakes were very good.   I still prefer the bone fish grill. They had great service.$LABEL$3
So$LABEL$4
I really wanted to love Upstream$LABEL$2
Great food! Great service! Our waiter was Christopher$LABEL$5
I came to Charlotte on a business trip and checked out yelp and picked this restaurant.  I had a reservation for 7:30 but was not seated till 8:05.  I ordered the lobster and it was not fresh.  The server was fantastic but not the lady in the front.  Horrible customer service and just gave me this attitude.  Whatever$LABEL$3
Thanksgving? At Upstream?They were open and served up an extravaganza and if this is any indication of their famed Sunday brunch I need to hustle over to Upstream this weekend.The all you can eat buffet is pricey ($40) but I think I ate that much in oysters alone.Offerings ran the gamete from delicious looking cheese plates and salads (I say looking because I didn't sample - saving my stomach space for...) the raw bar$LABEL$4
Looks like I am not the only one that had a poor experience at this UPS store. I went in to ship a package that I needed to return to Amazon. The owner barely glanced at my package$LABEL$1
This place should have scads of glowing reviews! My family loves this place for many good reasons. It is currently in the middle of a major renovation which is why it gets 4 stars for now rather than 5.Where to start? This is a full service gym and community center with all kinds of programs to serve individuals and families. If you have kids you MUST check it out. The staff here are super friendly and helpful. The facility is modern and clean$LABEL$4
Where I come from the \""Y\"" isn't held in high esteem because not a lot of care goes into the facility. However$LABEL$4
If you are not from the area$LABEL$4
Recently joined the YMCA and this is my \""home\"" ymca.  I LOVE the equipment and 'most' of the staff.  I have hit the gym (been a member about 30 days) at very varied times but have settled on 5 am for strength training (mon/wed/fri) and 3pm (ish) for cardio (Tues/Thurs/Sat).  At either time it isn't overwhelmingly crowded.I will say at 5 am (and I assume other times) there are plenty of meat heads in the weight room - grunting$LABEL$4
This is the closest Y to my house. I am happy with it overall. I usually exercise solo. The Harris Y has a ton of services$LABEL$4
Wait 20 mins for an elliptical. The weights are limited and they don't have a lot of machines. Oversold memberships. I just closed my over priced membership and joined fitness connection where everything is new and only 10 bucks a month. The Y is overrated.$LABEL$1
This Y is huge. It has two indoor pools and an out door pool with diving pad for competition.  The kids have their own building with all kids activities in it. The pool area is huge$LABEL$5
My family and I have enjoyed being members of the Harris YMCA for about 10 years now.  We have enjoyed summer camps$LABEL$2
I like Showmars restaurants and this one is no exception. I went in during the busy lunch hour and received very fast service and good food in a clean environment. This location has a drive thru. I recommend the grilled chicken pita for lunch!$LABEL$4
Inexpensive$LABEL$5
I usually go to another showmars consistently$LABEL$5
Initially the Customer Service from the woman who collects the items was wonderful$LABEL$1
I had been a customer at Morningstar Cleaners for about 5 years and found the prices to be great and the ladies who work the store front to be wonderful!  However$LABEL$1
I took 2 black shirts size L and they came out XXL I gave them the opportunity to rectify the situation in any kind of way and and sorry it's all I got. Customer service goes a long way and If I can save someone to get their clothes ruined at this place$LABEL$1
This is presently my branch of Bank of America. It's a great location because there aren't often long lines (unless you go on a Friday evening$LABEL$4
This branch was recently expanded$LABEL$3
I am a business customer and as such the business teller is NEVER open and when the sign is not up they take customers from the business line. Once I stood in the business line for 10 mins$LABEL$1
Nothing special to note about this location of the Papa John's chain.  They generally perform reasonably well$LABEL$2
Their sauce is terrible...  I like the fact that you can order online$LABEL$2
This particular location has really let me down!!!  I ordered breadsticks and a large pizza. The breadsticks box had grease leaked all over. Both the pizza and the breadsticks are not the quality I used to. The cheese on the pizza is not melted or maybe it had harden anyways I couldn't eat it after half of the slice. My partner and I are great fan of papa johns pizza but this particular location has the worst pizza/breadsticks and service.$LABEL$1
I would hardly call this place a spa. They were extremely overcrowded and the utensils were not sanitized properly. The employees were rude (probably because they have so many clients at once). While getting my pedicure I noticed one of the 'clean' towels being used on me had hair on it. The girl who ended up doing my nails was sweet and I am fairly pleased with the job she did but I would not go back.$LABEL$1
I used to love coming to foxy nails$LABEL$1
I used to get my toes done at Foxy Nails a few years ago and always found it clean and satisfactory but the facility has become rundown and the staff is rude and racist. When another client wanted to know how long she'd have to wait to have her eyebrows done$LABEL$1
This place is also called the Kabob House. Basically its a nice restaurant interior with one guy working as hostess$LABEL$2
I'm glad that someone else mentioned that this was known as the Kabob House$LABEL$3
Beef Kabob gets an easy FIVE Stars!!!  Persian Hot Tea$LABEL$4
Very good.  I am part Iranian$LABEL$4
We were the only people in the entire place. Service was okay$LABEL$2
My husband has revoked my Groupon privileges. If this review was just for the food it would be an easy 3 or 3.5 stars. The food was all delicious - we had the sauteed eggplant appetizer$LABEL$2
The best goat roti in Charlotte!$LABEL$4
I was really looking forward to this place$LABEL$2
For a \""fast\"" food place.. this place is not that fast....  Yes$LABEL$2
I purchased a 2002 Mercury Sable from my uncle out of the area. On the drive to Charlotte I noticed a slight stutter when at red lights. I figured all I needed was a tune-up or just new spark plugs and wires. The folks at Town and Country agreed. They also wanted me to replace the ignition coil$LABEL$1
Unfortunately$LABEL$1
I recently came here for a safety recall having to do with the cruise control of my 2002 Ford Explorer. I had sent an online request for an appointment Tuesday for the recall service (free) and to get \""THE WORKS? FUEL SAVER PACKAGE $39.95 OR LESS\"" which includes free tire rotation. Two days later$LABEL$1
I'm still getting mailers from this place. Nope. I won't go. Keep your stinky coupons. Boo.$LABEL$1
I had an appointment to see a vehicle on Saturday at 10:15 am$LABEL$1
I would NEVER suggest that anyone shop for a used vehicle at this Ford dealership.  The used car Sales Manager is lacking character and integrity.  They had a vehicle priced online right at the price we were looking for so we went in to see the vehicle.  It was a very basic$LABEL$1
I only gave them one star because it may look like I just didn't rate them if I left it at 0. WORST PLACE EVER!! I was told by a rude salesperson and an even more rude manager that I did not qualify for the 04 ford expedition I went to see before I was even given an opportunity to test drive. After leaving highly upset I stopped down the road at City Chevrolet where I was greeted by a courteous sales professional by the name of Avon Spann \""THE CHEVY MANN\"". Not only did he get me in a 2014 vehicle which I didn't qualify for as far as ford was concerned. But he treated me so well I don't want to buy cars from anyone or anywhere else. Even if you want a Ford still go see The CHEVY MANN @ City Chevrolet. He'll get you anything you ask for. My brother is working with him to buy a BMW that is in Tallahassee$LABEL$1
not happy with this dealership because you cant reach anyone in service and it goes straight to the answering machine and then they never return your calls.$LABEL$1
Everybody here is very rude$LABEL$1
We went here because there was a wobble and wup wup wup noise coming from one of our wheels.  After they put the car up on the lift and inspected it$LABEL$1
Hopefully our experience here will be nice$LABEL$2
This is one of those all-american places that serves just about anything but none of it is truly outstanding.  But it is a good place to go to hang out$LABEL$3
Great for breakfast. Good biscuits and link sausages. Also I have not been disappointment with fish dishes$LABEL$4
Came here for dinner and was told to order the Cheeseburger. Good. I must say it wasn't extremely spectacular$LABEL$3
Great breakfast! Food is very consistent always seems a little better than the other similar places around here. The one thing I like is that they know how to fry an egg over medium. I know it is a simple task$LABEL$4
If Sunrise is open then it is usually busy. During lunch it is very busy$LABEL$3
For traditional Mexican fare with large portions and no frills$LABEL$5
Yes$LABEL$4
I didn't want to love it. I wanted to stick to our neighborhood places$LABEL$5
This place reminds me of the Mexican pavillion at Epcot$LABEL$3
This is a nice$LABEL$3
I've been to a few strip clubs and this one is ugh... okay I guess. The girls are really friendly though but are average looking and average dancers. One of the girls played pool with me for an hour or two and talked lol. It is cheap though which is always a plus. I believe $25 for a private dance and $10 for a table dance. My friend and I went there to watch the Heighsman and my friends dude won (Jameis Winston) and he celebrated by getting us a private dance lol. I'd say if you wanna have a fun night bring $55 a person. Also its free before 9 p.m. to get in I think!$LABEL$3
As I was out running some errands$LABEL$2
Party of One deal keeps getting more expensive.  Salad tastes like it was bought from Food Lion.Pizza is what you'd expect.$LABEL$2
We have gone to this Pizza Hut in the past and were not satisfied with the service. When we first moved to our house$LABEL$1
The only shoe repair I know of in a 7 mile radius in this area.  It's a little spooky walking down the corridor between the grocery store and the rest of the strip mall to get to Baker's.  But the friendly staff can help with your basic repair needs.  And turnaround time and prices are reasonable.$LABEL$3
Baker's was suggested as a place to have my daughter's tap shoes built up.  For a split second after walking in the door$LABEL$3
There isn't a whole lot to be said about Bojangles' that you wouldn't know already.  If you haven't had their Cajun-style chicken$LABEL$3
This is just what we needed as a pick-me-up for our 4 hour drive to Myrtle Beach from Charlotte. The people were friendly$LABEL$3
This is the last straw!  I love bojangles$LABEL$1
2.5 stars- It may seem that I don't appreciate the fact that there is a natural food store near my neighborhood$LABEL$3
I actually wondered for a while what was up with this store - I mean really$LABEL$3
Offers the same great items the one on South Blvd does the only downside to this location is the lack of deli and smoothie/juice stand.$LABEL$3
I love$LABEL$3
I don't live in this neighborhood but did have a client in the area that given the lack of healthy places to eat lunch I took refuge here. Upon my first visit I was saddened to find this location does not have a deli like the South Blvd location. However$LABEL$3
This used to be a good place to go to. However$LABEL$2
I wish I could review the Folger Subaru Service Center separate from the Sales Team / Dealership$LABEL$3
Ok$LABEL$5
If you like lip service$LABEL$2
We took my wife's Sorento into for service on her A/C for the first time in March. They told us it was her compressor and they replaced it. Luckily we had a extended warranty and they covered most of it. That didn't work so we took it back. They said it was a bad control unit and wanted $600+ to replace it. I found it online for just over $400 and I replaced it myself. That didn't fix it so we took it back again. They said it was a bad control module and that they were going to replace it. They charged us for the replacement but didn't replace it and then determined it was a bad replacement control unit. They ordered a warranty replacement and I picked it up (much to their disappointment) and put it in myself. That didn't work either and after spending over $1000 and wasting two plus months with them we took it to Dale Jarrett Kia in Monroe. They determined it was a different module that determines the temperature was bad from the beginning and had most likely been the culprit the whole time. They were able to get Kia to warranty TWO new control units that were damaged because the module had burned the other two out. They had it two weeks straight but were able to finally diagnose the cause and origin of the problem. Folger Kia has got to be the worse dealership in the Charlotte area. We spoke directly with Kia corporate and they apologized for how horrible Folger Kia was and how badly they treated us. My wife went in when we were finished dealing with Folger to get a receipt to give to Dale Jarrett and Mike Melton treated her horribly. I will NEVER use or recommend Folger Kia to anyone. They are dishonest and their customer service is terrible. If you have to use a Kia dealer go to Dale Jarrett. It isn't that far but your experience will be so much better.$LABEL$1
My husband and I spent all day on a Saturday searching for our second car and wanted to find a good deal for a pre-owned vehicle.  After stopping at literally every other dealership in the vicinity and just as we were about to give up$LABEL$3
Once upon a time$LABEL$3
This place is slimey as all heck & a disgrace to the KIA brand.  I chose to go to this dealership because I was under the pretense of a false trade-in promotion.  Their claimed minimum trade-in value does not pertain to the vast majority of their car lot. Their selection is extremely weak (they only carrying a handful of each model).  In the last decade I've purchased cars from the Independence Carmax (twice)$LABEL$1
DO NOT BUY A CAR from FOLGER KIA. In march$LABEL$1
We typically go to Matthews Animal Clinic - we just started doing so and always kept at it.  But there was one time that we needed to have something taken care of$LABEL$3
I  disagree with the previous comment.  I$LABEL$3
...and this chit-hole is still open??  WHY???  Must be so the gang-bangers have a place to conduct target practice.$LABEL$1
A lot of folks are talking trash about Eastland Mall and I understand their concerns.  However$LABEL$3
Unfortunately$LABEL$1
For a Mall that's closing down and doesn't have any anchor stores left it's ok for what it is- although the mall is dead there are still some specialty shops that one could go to if they really needed something$LABEL$2
MALL CLOSEDJune 30$LABEL$1
When I moved to Charlotte$LABEL$3
I love this place for my nails and pedicure! I am so particular$LABEL$5
First off$LABEL$1
Purchased the living social for two oil changes and tire rotation. The first one went great- they did an overall inspection and told me about a few things on my car that would need some attention in the future (included on a written report). He did try to get me to get a couple additional services for an astronomical price$LABEL$2
I'm not sure what's up with the 90% off banner...not a lot of the stuff is 90% off...but there are still some good sales going on right now. They've got some interesting things in the shoe and clothing departments$LABEL$4
Stopped here for the first time tonight. The store is a small corner store with three or four tables. You can watch the three cooks cooking your meal. I ordered their chicken chow mein to go. The vegetables were crisp and the flavor good. I will come back.$LABEL$3
My boyfriend called for delivery we didn't know exactly what we wanted$LABEL$2
The crab rangoons are awesome! The rest was mediocre. The eggrolls were ok. The rice was plain$LABEL$2
Laser quest is a fun experience for kids of all ages$LABEL$2
Recently had my son's 9th birthday party here.Staff is super nice but the overall facilities are small and lacking for a child's birthday party.There is not an area for adults to sit while kids are in the laser tag area.No assistance is provided in the 'party room' for distributing drinks$LABEL$2
Always great service.  I never feel like they are trying to take advantage of me.$LABEL$5
This is the most awesome place to get your car serviced if you have a Honda/Acura!  They are knowledgeable$LABEL$5
Excellent service department$LABEL$4
What an amazing car buying experience I had here!!!  They know how to make you feel taken care of.  The dealership is gorgeous but the real treat here are the people.  Everyone is SOOO nice and accommodating.  It's \""above and beyond\"" in everything they do.$LABEL$5
Had to visit Lexus dealership at northlake twice after the initial issues$LABEL$3
I have purchased 4 Lexus . I had a 2001 IS$LABEL$5
This dealer has no intention of making good on discounts offered.  I clearly received an email offer for $50 to be used AS CASH on ANY repair$LABEL$1
Looking for a local greasy spoon in east Charlotte?  This place has slipped under the radar for some reason.I used to go here on a regular basis when I worked nearby.  Ted's has been on Monroe Rd since the early 1980's.  The lunchtime is pretty busy and its nice to see blue and white collar workers mixing together.  The food is pretty good.  It's your typical Greek-owned-Southern-down-home-cooking place.  The lunch specials are around $6.  They have a superburger$LABEL$3
Ted's is NOWHERE NEAR Eastland.  It's a stone's throw from McAlpine Park and the train bridge on Monroe Rd.  That's about 8 miles  from Central Ave at Sharon Amity and shutdown forever Eastland Mall.  Don't say no to Teds thinking it is in the HOOD.  It is not.If you like the big$LABEL$4
This is a great local business to support. The staff is super nice and are more then willing to accommodate you. My husband and I occasionally stop in for bite. I love the friend chicken$LABEL$5
Ted's is like one of those diner's you can find in small towns$LABEL$3
Awesome food! One of Charlotte's hidden gems!  I have been eating at Ted's for over 20 years and they ALWAYS serve excellent food!  I love the chicken on pita.... they have the best Tzatziki sauce!!  Yummy!!!  I also love their special Grecian chicken with the salad!!$LABEL$5
I absolutely love Ted's. They are always friendly and the food is yummy. The superburger for my son$LABEL$5
As a place to try a new brew$LABEL$3
Food: 2Beer: 5 +Atmosphere: 4Service: 5Culture: 5Distance from my apartment for a great drinkery: -10004.5 starsThe bar runs almost the entire length of this rather large restaurant.  And taps are placed every foot or so along the entire stretch.  Intrigued?  If not$LABEL$4
It's fairly obvious when you see an endless line of platters on the wall highlighting those who have had 200 or more different beers... the place is popular and its regulars are very much so.  This place is about beer$LABEL$5
Great beer selection.  Not a whole lot of women$LABEL$4
Obviously$LABEL$4
So I am a fan of the saucer.  I have a plate on the wall and an on my way to number two.  Great place for beer specials$LABEL$4
This is a very cool bar with great beer$LABEL$4
Ding Ding Ding!  We have a winner.  This is the best beer  brewery/tastery/deliciousry/savory place in all of Charlotte.  Well$LABEL$5
This is a great neighborhood pub with a fantastic selection of great beers and nightly events/specials.  If you enjoy exploring the various tastes possible with diverse brewing styles$LABEL$5
If you are a beer connoisseur$LABEL$4
Beer selection:  amazing.  Location:  across the street from my office$LABEL$4
Well$LABEL$3
Waited on by a Beer Goddess!  She knew the correct answer to every question$LABEL$5
I'd been here a number of years back$LABEL$4
large selection of draft and specials on pricing.  Quality staff.$LABEL$3
Great place and enough beer there to please anyone. You have to join the beer club and try to drink around the world. I am in the process of this now and I am having a lot of fun doing it! The food is ok but when you do go there you MUST get the pretzels the dipping sauce is great. You can either dip it in Cheese sauce or spicy mustard. I tell you$LABEL$4
So many beer options$LABEL$4
Great food and great brew! Definitely will be back.$LABEL$4
What can I say$LABEL$5
Went there for the first time last Saturday. While the beer menu is impressive$LABEL$1
Beer$LABEL$4
The beer selection is amazing...definitely a place to check out if you are a beer person...all types of beer from all around the world...and I can't forget the food is pretty good too!$LABEL$5
I would give this place about 3.5 overall. I have been going there for 7 years$LABEL$3
First night in Charlotte and just wanted some bar food$LABEL$5
I am only giving this place 3 stars based on their beer selection and my companion's lunch quality.  When we stopped in with the kids it was a really nice big restaurant.  They have a sitting area and great big bar.  Very fun atmosphere with all the plates on the ceiling of the adventuresome drinkers.  Service was great and fast.  I had the Saucer Dipster sandwich - man what  a let down.  It was supposed to be like a French Dip I think.  It was just two pieces of roast beef on a huge hard roll with one piece of cheese.  What a let down.  And i paid $8.49?!?!?!  Everyone else liked their sandwiches tho so we will probably be back except I for sure wont get that again.$LABEL$3
I like the beer selection and love the Colorado beer connection since I have roots from there. However the food side needs a little work. More pizza selections and sizes wouldn't hurt would they? Appetizers aren't bad in general. Overall it's a decent place to go for a chain joint.$LABEL$3
My advice - come here for the beer if you're in the University area$LABEL$2
Really hate to do it- but last night was pretty awful here. On any normal day you seem to get by with the average slip here or two$LABEL$2
Slow service. Horribly under staffed. Waited a while to get my order taken$LABEL$2
This place was ok.  It had its good points and bad points.  First off$LABEL$3
Great selection of beers. Not the best food but it's a beer bar after all. Was a better place when they had pool tables but not a bad place to watch a ballgame now.  Monday has really good specials for draft beers. And seasonal rotations offer great new selections.$LABEL$5
I feel like sometimes the saucer is over rated but maybe that's because sometimes I just want a Miller Lite$LABEL$4
Awesome employees$LABEL$5
Two things really stood out for me when visiting the Flying Saucer. 1. The beer selection is amazing. Excellent draft selection and a long bottle list. 2. The service is top notch. All the servers were beautiful$LABEL$4
Great set of Drafts available. Great atmosphere for drinking. Its usually crowded on weekdays and weekends are worst.$LABEL$5
I became a fan of the Saucer years ago$LABEL$4
Not a great selection of beer for a place called a \""Draught Emporium\"".  Also the food was less than mediocre and they were out both chicken tenders and pizza when we were there.  There are a lot of much better places to get craft beer and bar food in Charlotte.$LABEL$1
Great food$LABEL$5
Well it was my first time back here in a good long time- probably close to a year. As you can read from a past update$LABEL$5
While this isn't the fanciest of places by any means (two hand-written signs on the wall proclaim \""no cigar smoking in restaurant\"")$LABEL$2
This place kind of reminds me of the restaurant my grandparents used to take me to when I was a kid.  The kind of down home looking place where no one would suspect mobsters to meet and plan their various activities over coffee.  I'm kidding of course$LABEL$3
This is a late night grub spot that has down-home country style breakfast dishes served around the clock$LABEL$3
While not the fanciest place$LABEL$3
Well....it is open 24 hours.$LABEL$2
Great place for breakfast$LABEL$5
This 5 star review is very different from most of my others. This is a 5 star perfect run of the mill$LABEL$5
Good breakfast spot. Can't go wrong with 2 eggs scrambled with cheese$LABEL$3
This store is smaller than the PetSmarts$LABEL$3
Tired of PetSmart ? Give this place a try. Ok$LABEL$4
Great staff!$LABEL$4
This YMCA is tucked away off of Albemarle Rd.  It's easy to miss if you aren't looking for it.Lots of amenities$LABEL$3
This YMCA is very easily missed if you do not have a GPS system.  It is tucked away from eyesight off of Albemarle Road.  The parking lot is very awkward and uneven to me.  This area has a lot of involvement with children from what i have noticed on my regular visits.  The weight room is small but it has a lot of free weights to use if your use to lifting weights.$LABEL$3
I try not to leave reviews based on any one outlying event. This review is no different. I don't recommend this Hertz location$LABEL$2
This place STUNK! Figuratively... I think the customer service$LABEL$1
Where to start with this review?We went with Hertz because I did the Name Your Own Price option on Priceline$LABEL$1
2 words: unorganized chaos. I hate when rental car companies are offsite from the airport. Then the line wrapped around the door & they only had 2 people helping people!!! Will be avoiding this place in the future.$LABEL$1
One of the worst rental experiences of my life. Computers were down and had to write out rental agreements by hand. Waited over a hour for them to process 4 rentals. The line behind me very long and no concession was offered. Got a Chevy piece of junk Aveo. Talk about a tin can on wheels! Transmission sounded horrible (grinding sound) and could feel the vibration at certain speeds/gears. Barely had enough power to go up a hill and still maintain highway speed. Next time it Avis or anyone else beside Hertz.$LABEL$1
Have yet to recieve my security deposit that i was suppose to get over three weeks ago. Horrible customer service and there is so many fee's after the fact that they will not inform you of. Not only will i never use hertz again i will suggest to anyone who visits to get basically anyone but hertz horrible.$LABEL$1
I waited an hour and a half for my car$LABEL$1
I've used Hertz since I was old enough to rent a car$LABEL$1
What a lousy experience.  Perhaps there was a reason they were so unprepared but as a regular Hertz Gold customer I was astonished at the disorganization of this facility. Last Thursday afternoon a bus full of travelers$LABEL$2
The car was nice$LABEL$1
I'm still so baffled... So we take a shuttle to your location. We wait in line to speak with a representative$LABEL$2
Worst Hertz location experience I have ever had.  The car I reserved was not in my Gold space so I went inside.  They told me the class of car I reserved was in the space but would get me the actual car I reserved$LABEL$1
Not a great Hertz location and they need much better signage and training.  I have been Hertz Gold Presidents Circle for the past 7 years$LABEL$2
I am a President's Club member$LABEL$1
This location is actually the best I've found in the country.  Many (most) Hertz locations are chock full of mean people who hate their jobs$LABEL$4
The worst Hertz location I've dealt with! The shuttle driver did not offer to help me or my colleague with our bags$LABEL$1
I'm all grows up$LABEL$3
Even though we had a reservation we were made to wait for a car. If they're going to overbook cars they should offer free upgrades to get people on the road. I'd look elsewhere.$LABEL$2
I got there at midnight to pick up my rental and the entrance was gated... After checking to make sure we weren't missing another possible entrance$LABEL$1
Leave another 2 days for your trip$LABEL$1
Never again.Lines are terribly long$LABEL$1
They have the worst customer service I have ever experienced. Never again will I rent from them. When I needed to turn the car in an hour early in order to get to my flight on time$LABEL$1
What a disaster -- so bad it Hurts. Hertz ruined a birthday surprise that friends lined up for me$LABEL$1
Zero stars of I could for this Charlotte Hertz location- after waiting 45 min in line to get my filthy$LABEL$1
There's about 50 people in line$LABEL$1
I had a Gold reservation but arrived to find my name was not on the board. I waited in line with a dozen other livid Gold members and was then offfered a mini-van or to pay extra for an upgrade. If I gould give Hertz a zero I would.$LABEL$1
Takes terribly long although I am Gold Member. Name is not listed on the board. Endless discussions.... It took 45 min to get the car.$LABEL$2
I reserved a rental through Hotwire for a full-size car. When I arrived late at night to pick up my vehicle$LABEL$2
Bad service$LABEL$1
I usually do not get this kind of service at any rental car places$LABEL$5
It's been a few weeks now since my trip from my house on Cape Cod to my niece's wonderful wedding in Greenville SC.  The trip is basically three legs : 1) bus Logan Airport$LABEL$1
Like the previous reviewers$LABEL$1
Flights we're canceled so I needed to drive 8 hours home. Upon return$LABEL$1
It Hurtz Horrible. Two painful experiences in a month. On my first  the front desk persons were slow$LABEL$1
It is the busiest holiday week of the year and they have one man working and two broken kiosks. 1 hour wait. I would do half a star if possible.$LABEL$1
Horrible treatment. The worst management team ever. They are not interested in helping with your situation at all$LABEL$1
45 minute wait for a car I reserved a month ago??? Ridiculous.  The staff seemed unsympathetic to everyone.  In addition$LABEL$1
I rent from Hertz every week and have been a Presidential Circle member for several years.  I have probably rented from over a 100 different Hertz locations.  This one is by-far the WORST.....EVER! The shuttle is super slow and with one shuttle running$LABEL$1
Very$LABEL$1
Lousy scratched up car. 20k miles on it. No USB port. But it was clean and ran well. The shuttle back to the airport was hilariously bad.  The guy sat I'm the lot empty for 10 mins$LABEL$1
This service really sucks. Reservations are not honored even if prepaid. Only highly \""upgraded\"" cars are available. As I sit here four over an hour I know I will NEVER use hertz again.$LABEL$1
Oh my God. The shuttle ride from the terminal to this Hertz was interminable. Incredible traffic on the access road$LABEL$2
The worst service and slowest employees I've ever seen. Tons of Hertz reps lurking around$LABEL$1
Friendly staff$LABEL$2
****Watch Your Pennies$LABEL$1
Stay away. The whole experience was terrible.I was shown to a phone kiosik to check in with an agent through a video-conference. That was not ideal. Do I want to hold an old school phone to my ear while trying to find reservation documents$LABEL$1
So far...not so good. We are waiting in the lobby with 20+ other renters. We've been here 30 min$LABEL$1
Terrible service$LABEL$1
We made our reservation through Priceline and were really worried based on the previous reviews. Our plane was on time and made it to the Hertz location only having to wait about 5 minutes for the bus. There was only one person in front of us in line and we were out of there in less than 10 minutes with no pressure for upgrades or any other sort of hassle. We were given a Nissan Sentra which was fine for the weekend$LABEL$3
The worst place to rent a car from !! They have no cars . Must wait almost 2 hours for a car and they don't care ! Stay away$LABEL$1
Well$LABEL$2
This is the first time ever I wrote a bad review but I am just that frustrated with Hertz CLT.  I was nodding my head on all the negative reviews on Hertz CLT location cause that is my personal experience also.  I am a Gold Circle member but apparently it makes no difference at this location.  I got on-time Carfirmation once out of five rentals in Sept  and your name is not on the board either.  It is true the lines are super long and not unusual to wait in line at least for 20 mins or more even if you are a Gold Circle member and that you had reserved the car properly.  It is also embarrassing to drive a car to the client site$LABEL$1
Quite possibly the SLOWEST moving place on earth. Took over 30 mins to get a car. Wait line is slow and long to get keys and then super long wait for car to be pulled up. Doesn't this place know that every other rental place is more efficient?Avoid this one if you can.$LABEL$1
Do not rent here.  Bait and switch.  Book a car at a rate and then they give you a smaller car$LABEL$1
Uuuuuuh this place isn't so bad it hertz but it does hertz a bit.  I got my car through orbitz and granted it was Christmas eve so it was crowded$LABEL$3
I rent from National in Charlotte about once a month$LABEL$5
Showed up in NC for a business meeting.  The National shuttle driver was very nice and helpful.  As soon as we got off the shuttle things turned unorganized.  People wondering around the lot to pick out their cars.....and many employees standing around smiling ....okay fine.  We picked out our car$LABEL$1
Was treated kindly and quickly. Saw some others mischarged$LABEL$3
DO NOT BOOK A RENTAL CAR THROUGH NATIONAL. Our shuttle driver Terry was fantastic & friendly$LABEL$1
No complaints here. The workers at the desk are informative$LABEL$3
Ordinarily I have good service from National and even great in some locations$LABEL$3
At the CLT location counter we were offered an upgrade (we had reserved a premium car$LABEL$2
Nice selection of cars$LABEL$1
Great selection$LABEL$5
The staff was very nice and helpful because I signed up for the Emerald program which made the return of the car so easy.  The rental location is very close to the airport through shuttle.  Recommended.$LABEL$5
We love being part of the Emerald club. Debbie was great. Our goto car rental location.$LABEL$5
I've heard of supply demand but this place truly capitalized on other rental car companies in airport being unavailable.  $600 for 4 day rental of a ridiculous Mustang!  I took for the day then reserved a vehicle with Avis the next day.Enterprise also doesn't have a preferred program worthwhile...I'll stay with Avis and now I know why Time Warner doesn't use them as a corporate provider.$LABEL$1
The most seamless car rental experience ever.  The agents were super friendly and helpful$LABEL$5
Very crowded Enterprise location based on the fact they are at the airport.  They seem to do a decent job of staffing the place so that keeps the flow of folks moving pretty well.No real complaints$LABEL$3
After a fiasco with another car company$LABEL$5
Enterprise. First time because AMEX for whatever reason didn't book National this time. They even told me it was the same company which is clearly not the case.Arriving$LABEL$1
Amazing customer service. Quick$LABEL$5
Worse check-in system yet encountered in my travels.   About a 20+ minute wait after checking-in at the counter.   Will not go here again.$LABEL$1
At the end of July I contacted the 800 reservation line at Alamo to make plans for a car rental from August 6-August 13 at the Charlotte airport location. I was going to be using my Hilton Honors points to secure this car$LABEL$1
I am a big fan of Enterprise. The people all have  a great attitude. This location was a bit different somewhat due to the insane amount of construction at Charlotte airport. The place was crowded and for some reason the process to get a car was painful. Waiting on 3 different lines for a car while others allow you to check in and go grab a car seems a bit dated.$LABEL$3
Everyone was very friendly and accommodated my needs$LABEL$4
The chicken wings are great. Everything else was ugh. I had the shrimp with broccoli which by the way was mostly broccoli and the rice tasted like pool water. Never again!!$LABEL$1
This place used to be good. It is convenient to me and while not great$LABEL$1
I ordered General Tso's chicken and beef fried rice and both were vastly sub-par. The chicken was tangy and had an off taste. The rice was soggy and the beef was over cooked.  Also it took a hour and a half for the food to show up and even the egg roll was only average. I will not be ordering from this place ever again and I would strongly tell anyone I know not to order from there either.$LABEL$1
I Must start with saying that I Can't Believe what has happened to this place! My father and I used to frequent WOK BO for years initially after them opening! The good \""WAS\"" great the service \""WAS\"" great and the quality was top notch. Over the past couple years they have been dwindling down Quality and Service have become BIG Issues! They have a man I apologize I can't remember his name a younger guy. Since he has been there They have lost all of our business! He is cocky and a complete smart A$$. My apologies but there is no other way to put it! He really could care less if you have or had a problem. He is nice upfront until an issue arises! We have received wrong partial orders and orders that have been half wrong half right when we ordered delivery recently trying to give wok BO another chance. After a \""FEW\"" wrong orders one evening I decided to call it back in. After The delivery took 45mins beyond what we were told initially I got nothing but attitude from the young man and was told that What I received is what I ordered. No it wasn't! Still had the paper that we write our orders on and called in with. After I was politely told by him that I must have thought we ordered the other stuff he says that they will send the driver back out but would be about an hour and asked for us to pay the 5.47 difference in price and return the other meal. Maybe it's just me but that's bad business! We had 3 people there to eat as I explained to him and now for everyone to eat together there food would be cold as well as the inconvenience. This happened several times recently as I have said but the COMPLETE ATTITUDE this young man always has when there is a problem makes thus past Friday my last meal from them. Mrs. Nancy and her husband(Assuming they are still the owners) that owned wok Bo are great people I only hope that they see how detrimental to the business this guy is before its to late! I would live to have the old wok-Bo back it was by far a favorite but my business will not return until this young man is gone! Many others I know have had the same sorts if problems with him and will not return either. So much for an 8+ years of being a customer!$LABEL$1
This place is horrible!  The ONLY reason we order from them is because they deliver.  Most of the time we tolerate their food if for the grace of god they get our order correct.  2 out of the last 3 times we've ordered they have screwed up our order.  It takes them normally over an hour to get our food to us.  The most recent horrible experience I order the Shrimp Chow Mein.  My order came without the crunchy noodles.  So all i had was a pile of lettuce soaked in some liquid with shrimp.  I called and complained and the lady that answered said the next time I ordered she would give me an extra bag of crunchy noodles.  I told her I might not order this again next time.  Then she offered a free drink.  We don't go there in person we only order.  I wasn't going to take a free coke for them messing up my order.  I told her how about you knock $5 off our next order.  The lady refused.  Don't waste your time.  They don't care how crappy their service is.  Take the extra time and drive to Red Bowl or a better restaurant.  I'd give them 0 stars if I could.$LABEL$1
Horrible customer service and when I talked to the manager she apologized but you can tell she didn't care.$LABEL$1
When we needed to replace our heat pump$LABEL$5
They do good work but be aware that they do charge extra for weekend and afterhour calls.One of the sites I looked at said they had no extra charge for afterhour calls(like many now offer)but their rate is $30 more for the trip and higher rates for the repair.Just FYI$LABEL$3
Just ate Miguel's for lunch today and got my fill of fast food Mexican for a decent price.  I'm not overly impressed by the place$LABEL$3
Good mexican food at a great price conveniently located near the Charlotte airport.  Simple as it gets.  Service is friendly and food is good.  All of the other reviewers do a good job of explaining the ins and outs of this place$LABEL$5
I would have never waked into this placE without the reviews from Yelp and man am I glad I did. Great food served up in a shed. Will return.$LABEL$4
Basic little Mexican restaurant with so so service. The food is reasonably priced and relatively good. My favorite part about this place is their outdoor seating area. Covered booths with open air windows. My suggestion for this place would be the fajitas$LABEL$3
As other Yelpers have mentioned$LABEL$4
I come from a Mexican family and growing up in San Diego$LABEL$3
I look for a place like this near every airport I visit.  There is bound to be something good and cheap around the corner$LABEL$5
I remember the first time I ate here. It was near my best friend's home$LABEL$5
I think the only reason why this place has so many reviews is because it is centrally locate by several key hotels and ctl airport. If you are starving and need something quick$LABEL$3
I think this place is awesome and not because it has my name!! I used to go to CPCC and I would eat here at least 2-3 times a week. The chips and salsa are great and so is almost everything else on the menu. Do not let appearances fool you$LABEL$5
I'm officially a fan. There's room for improvement but it's everything I'd look for if I was looking for a locally owned$LABEL$4
Whoever said this place has good food$LABEL$2
Had to stay overnight in the area and the hotel suggested we try this place but that had warned us that is was a \""hole in the wall\"" and that was exactly right. It could use some TLC.Moving onto the food$LABEL$3
Don't be afraid by the exterior! Lunch date here with my co-workers after our weekly meeting. First off...I really should have gps'ed the address because this place off the beaten path...or maybe too beaten. It's actually on an I-85 service road nestled between a chain hotel and an old motel. I must say I was a wee bit concerned when I got out of the car. But it was all good when I got inside.I ordered the Quesadilla Rellino (sp) and a side order of guacamole. Of course the guac came out first and maybe its because I make a mean guacamole but this was a watered down avocado mousse with very little seasoning. I had to ask for a lime and shake some s&p before I could convince myself to eat it. Not okay!! My quesadilla however was awesome!! The chicken was seasoned so perfectly$LABEL$3
We had the fajitas for two$LABEL$5
Being near my office$LABEL$5
Great Food$LABEL$5
Mexican food was the last thing on my mind for my first dinner as a newbie NC transplant from San Diego$LABEL$4
I love Miguel's. It's not fancy but the food is really good. You could miss this place easily if you weren't looking for it. But do look for it$LABEL$4
Walking distance (right next door) to the Wingate$LABEL$3
Miguel's is a pretty ordinary joint - canteen type place. Nothing special about it. The lady who served us was so cold & uncourteous$LABEL$1
food quality a 4$LABEL$3
I was split between a three and a four star review. The salsa was watery and bland$LABEL$3
Great food!!!  Great service!  Great prices!  Authentic Mexican food in a casual setting. Three of us enjoyed three different entrees and all said we would definitely go back. Was close to the motel we stayed in while waiting for our next morning flight out of CLT.  Wouldn't stay in that motel again but will eat at Miguel's again for sure!$LABEL$5
what an amazing restaurant ...quaint$LABEL$5
Mixed review: chips and salsa were good$LABEL$2
The first time I went to Miguel's I ordered the fajita plate. That was pretty good. The second I brought my wife and we ordered the special Steak Burrito plate. We also ordered guacamole on the side. Nothing was authentic and nothing was fresh. The steak was like the Philly cheese steak you would get from a frozen box and the guacamole was definitely not fresh avocado. The chips and salsa... chips were made fresh as they were still warm and salsa could be freshly made but not sure. I was disappointed the second time. Not sure if I would go back. I can make better Mexican food than this place.$LABEL$2
When I first arrived in Charlotte the first order of business was where do I need to eat before going home and this was top on the list ( grilled cheese food truck is #2). We drive up to this hole in the wall style place with a wing of outdoor seating that was packed with people. We go inside and are met by our server who was very friendly. We ordered our queso appetizer as I begin to scour the menu for goodies. Settling on the enchiladas was an excellent choice! Overall lovely experience for a quick and reasonably priced meal. If ever in the area craving authentic style Mexican foods stop in and carb up!!$LABEL$4
This a a quinsential hole in the wall. But the food is really really goid$LABEL$4
Good bread$LABEL$2
This place is great for a great price. Every day there is a special which is a footlong sub for 4 bucks. Also if you get the special that day you can add the extra large drink for 99 cents! The little rock special is a Philly cheese steak with grilled opinions$LABEL$5
Let's face it.  Papa John's pizza is phenomenal compared to other national chains.  Their ingredients are simply better.  I order from this location and others very frequently.  The Freedom Dr. location sadly has a lack of attention to detail at times.  More than half of the time$LABEL$2
I am not a huge Papa John's person. I can say though$LABEL$3
Called from the airport for a pickup and was told the van broke down so they had an employee in his POV pick me up.  I got there and was helped immediately and was in my room within 5 minutes.  They have old CRT TV's with the typical channels.  The room was clean$LABEL$3
I hate to dis on a place that I stayed for free after being stranded in an airport after a cancelled flight....It wasn't great but it did the job.  The AC was loud and made it hard to sleep$LABEL$2
I mean$LABEL$3
Ok....I believe in giving a balanced assessment of a property when I yelp because I'd want nothing less when I read a review of a potential place to stay . That said$LABEL$3
Horrible.....horrible.Hole in the shower Stains on carpet Horrible stench I could go on forever.Stay here at your own peril!$LABEL$1
Gross$LABEL$1
It is what it is. A budget airport hotel. The staff are friendly. The free cookies are fresh and tasty. We were there from 1230 - 6. Slept in a comfy bed. Had a hot shower. No complaints.$LABEL$3
This place is promoted as a 3-star hotel.  All hotels are not the same.  All cities are not the same.  When traveling from one region of the country into another adjust your expectations accordingly.  If you are coming from the NY or SF/LA area into Charlotte then your expectations for a 3 star hotel according to the ratings need to be adjusted.  This hotel is billed on-line as a 3 star hotel.  It is a 2 star hotel at best.The staff is friendly$LABEL$2
I recently stayed here through Priceline. I was pretty disappointed. It was overall not nearly as clean as you'd expect it and furthermore what appeared to be the manager at the front desk was berating a woman who appeared to be a new hire in front of the customers. I felt terrible for this woman. Just a terrible presentation overall and if I had a choice$LABEL$2
DRAT.  I booked this three star hotel via hotwire Im not an expert on the 5 star rating scale$LABEL$1
Delay after delay with USAirways and I ended up missing my connecting flight back to Florida. The airline put me up in this hotel for the night.The keys weren't working so I had to be escorted up to my room. Anytime I wanted to leave and go back in my room$LABEL$2
The place reminds me a lot of my freshman dorm. Peeling walls$LABEL$1
This hotel is stuck in the middle of nowhere. The restaurant staff is relatively friendly$LABEL$1
Nice staff.Dirty. There was fecal matter on my shower curtin. Cleanliness is not a priority here.  Hotwire is the reason for all my problems. I will never do name your own price.$LABEL$1
Louisheta (spelling$LABEL$3
We stayed a week for a conference.  The hotel is under renovation.  The rooms are really nice.  The bathrooms are a little small.  We were told on check in that there was free continental breakfast on Tuesday  through Fridays.  That was weird in itself shouldn't it be everyday?  The front desk person went on to say that we needed vouchers but we would need to wait until the next day to get it.  Red flag!!! The next day around noon we go down stairs only to be told that we didn't need vouchers.  So my mom goes down on wed. To eat only to be told afterwards that there was a $9.99 fee.  She was able to eat without being charged...but management needs to get it together.  For the record...its not worth $9.99.  I hate having to beg for towels....and please dont give me a towel with someone else's make up.  You can see it just like i can when you are replacing them.  The Holiday Inn Brand shouldn't be abused just because there is a conference in town.  I forgot to mention that we were also charged for a suite when there are no suites in the hotel.  They did take care of that after a day of run around...my advice stay at another holiday inn until they get it together!!!!!$LABEL$2
Not a total sit down restaurant$LABEL$2
I've been here several times and the service has always been quick and friendly. The food has always been tasty and hot.$LABEL$3
I had the country fried steak with brown gravy$LABEL$2
After reading the other reviews$LABEL$5
Nearly a Charlotte institution$LABEL$3
The Flounder  sandwich and onion rings  at this place will set you free ! Good fresh cooked food..fast$LABEL$5
Very  friendly service and suprisingly good food.  We had the gyro and thought it was as good as anywhere else.  For getting there 5 min before closing the food was fresh and not old tasting.  Only issue was no green salad stuff on the wrap.  I would definately eat here again.$LABEL$4
Did a park and fly on our way to Alaska out of Charlotte. This was a quick hop away from our hotel. So-so menu. Adequate food...nothing fancy. Large portions. Quick service. Clean. Friendly. A safe place  a good meal.$LABEL$3
I think one has to be local to really enjoy Shomars.  The food is marginal$LABEL$2
I want to start off by saying that Chinese food should not have YELLOW Rice!!! They do have good lunch specials and again this Chinese food wasn't very good. Still searching for a good Chinese food place here in Charlotte. The only reason why I tried this place because I was next to it at the time. Still searching!$LABEL$2
If your're looking for a country breakfast$LABEL$5
great local business$LABEL$5
Great food and prices. The people are really nice.  Try the greek omelet.$LABEL$4
Good diner food$LABEL$5
I go to this place a lot for the buffet which is ok. Not really that big of a buffet and if you don't get there when it is fresh you might get some pretty cold food. However this review is about their take-out service. I give them a C- for this experience. They do not give a good portion size to take home and the food was a little bland. I expected more from them. I ordered the pan fried dumpling and the sauce that came with it was very gross it was like they didn't know how to make the proper sauce so they just gave me soy sauce and some spices to go a long with it. It was not good at all. I will probably be going back but only for the buffet would not recommend take out and i will not be doing that again.$LABEL$2
The CT2 buffet is decent.  It's small and the selection is not over whelming but it works for us.  We eat there every week or so because it's close to home and the food isn't terrible.  The family running the place should leave the kids at home as it sounds like a daycare sometimes.  The dining area is cold and drafty in the winter....  So I'm recommending take out.  We love the salt and pepper shrimp.$LABEL$3
Ordered take out which consisted of sesame chicken$LABEL$1
We have tried this place two times. Food was decent at best the first time for dinner. The second time we walked out before our meal even started due to the dry burnt food on the buffet and rude service. It's now an ongoing joke in our household of \""are you hungry enough to even eat at China Town?\""We're shocked it's survived this long with so little customers.$LABEL$1
We hunted and hunted for a good chinese place by our house$LABEL$5
staff is friendly enough..drs are quick and dont really listen or ask any questions... ive changed drs since my last visit and am very happy. i had an appt that i had rescheduled here and they keep sending and will not stop sending a letter asking me to pay for a missed visit when i called to cancel a week before. found a way better dr...little better to drive but at least i feel like im getting the customer service i deserve...$LABEL$1
Northwest Family Physicians is the best!  I have been going there for about 10 years or more. Incredible service all around.   Dr. Larsen is my favorite physician ever. He is very personable$LABEL$5
Amazing staff and doctor.  I've been seeing Dr. Larsen for years and trust his diagnosis.$LABEL$5
I have been a patient of doctor Larsen's since early 2014. I have seen the other doctor in the practice$LABEL$3
Thanks Microtel for saving us from a hotel disaster that we checked out of at around 1am. The front desk was super friendly and understanding and made us feel truly welcome here. The continental breakfast was luxurious$LABEL$4
In the time I've been living on the road I have never had a worse experience.  Bad service$LABEL$1
I was NOT impressed! The service was good...that's about it. The chicken sandwhich tasted like it had been left out a while before it was cooked...definitely not fresh!Their mashed potatos were good although they served it with sausage gravy which was unique. The cost was ok. Typical chicken place. The (women's) restroom wasn't cleaned very well and neither was the restaurant. Trying to find a clean table was not hard... only one amongst several messy tables. The only plus to the restaurant was the servers. They had smiles and treated us well. It was the first Bojangles I've been to and I was not impressed in the least.$LABEL$1
They got that Chicken! It's like I'm sayin. Mash Potatoes! Biscuits$LABEL$2
Steak biscuit Mac and cheese  green beans but no sweet potatoes pie....Not sure what all the hype is about this joint??? Guess next time I gotta try the chicken ?!$LABEL$3
The service at this location is really good$LABEL$2
Food is pretty good. Always go during the day. The night shift is ratchet! Seriously! Very selfish with bags. They will try to stuff everything in one bag. Dining area is clean.$LABEL$3
I hate to be negative. But not good at all. The worse I have had in a long time. The chicken had some weird batter on it$LABEL$1
HORRIBLE over fried unrecognizable meat in hard batter. Rice is reheated.$LABEL$1
I wouldn't eat here if it were the last food place in Charlotte. They have burnt broccoli. They also have a lack of good customer service. Oh not to mention how slow they are when you are waiting for your order. Don't waste your time!$LABEL$1
So tomorrow night is the first night of Hanukkah. YAY!! Oh wait I think I need to get some Hanukkah candles. I think I should stop at Harris Teeter on the way home from work.      I have not been normally shopping here$LABEL$3
This store is well put together and in a shopping center close to rite-aid$LABEL$4
Mmmmmmm.  The hubby and I met up with some friends here after spending a wedding weekend in Charlotte.  This place isn't much to look at$LABEL$4
Coming back through Charlotte to catch my flight$LABEL$3
I had heard really good things about Bubba's.  So many things$LABEL$3
I'd skipped Bubba's for a few years and must say that this latest Friday night on the way to Florida experience was a letdown.  The place was nearly empty$LABEL$2
meat was not smoked$LABEL$1
I've eaten Bubba's on a few different occasions and it's always been solid. It's a bit out of the way for me (Sunset Blvd.)$LABEL$4
Anyplace named Bubba's is a place needing a visit. Any place that combines Bubba's and Barbeque is a no brainer in the QC. Located in North Charlotte off exit 16 (Sunset Blvd West)$LABEL$4
This is one of the best BBQ places in the Charlotte area (and one of the older ones since it was originally Spoon's Barbecue)$LABEL$3
Now$LABEL$4
Whenever I am out of town for an extended trip I always try to find some local BBQ.  A local recommended Bubba's$LABEL$5
A good kept secret.Location is off of I-77 on Sunset....just look for the pig in the yard!Great food$LABEL$4
Being born and raised in Eastern North Carolina has made me really biased about eastern style barbecue$LABEL$2
I'm no barbeque expert but this food plain didn't taste good.  Ribs were laced with so much fat I couldn't even bite through them.  Hush puppies were the bright spot.  They used to serve a kick ass sweet potato pie with soft serve but that's no longer on the menu.  The restaurant was completely empty and a man I believe to be the owner was a little too friendly with us lingering at our table for a couple of awkward exchanges.  I wanted to love it but I couldn't.$LABEL$2
We drove a long drive to try this bbq. I do not recommend it. The food came out cold and not fresh. The server is clueless. Kept forgetting water$LABEL$2
Ribs was good and the cole slaw as well even for me because I hate cole slaw$LABEL$2
I wanted to like this place$LABEL$2
Called for delivery and was told they were closed though Yelp said they were open. Either they're wrong or Yelp is$LABEL$1
Cafeteria style Q.  Bubba's Barbecue is a regular old barbecue joint that you can find all over our great 50 states.  If I'm rating Bubba's against other Carolina Q joints that make an Eastern Carolina Q...Bubba's would get a zero.  Eastern Q is made from a whole hog pit barbecue.  You can tell immediately that a whole hog was not pit smoked for an extended amount of time.If you're looking for some pork with a vinegar sauce$LABEL$3
Finally stopped in for lunch today after driving by Bubba's about a thousand times.  I had the BBQ pork plate w/ slaw and beans.  It was OK.  Nothing special.  Just OK.  The pork is the finely chopped eastern style. Sauce again the thin eastern style.   Which is OK$LABEL$2
On our driving travels$LABEL$4
I am always leery of restaurants that display 20 year old accolades and newspaper articles.  This is what I was greeted with after being seated.With the temporary closure of Beatties Ford$LABEL$2
The service was nice$LABEL$1
This was okay$LABEL$3
1st time in.   Typical old school BBQ joint.  They do have both eastern and western NC sauce which is nice since I do like my tomato sauce with a vinegar kick.   O rings are beer battered.  Price is a bit steep for the portion but I understand the rising cost of pork.   Good waitstaff.  No complaints there.  I recommend it for lunch if your headed this way.  Update. I hadn't tried the o rings prior to posting.  Pass.  They are frozen. Or atleast not spectacular.  Like i said.  Good lunch spot.  Will come back though next time Im thinking ribs.$LABEL$3
Wow. Just was refused service because we had a large group. When we offered to break up and just sit with the family. Nope....not an option. Empty restaurant$LABEL$1
I've taken my car to Tuffy on S. Tryon near Ayrsley since I moved to Charlotte$LABEL$4
Why is your gas at the pump still $3.30 when everyone else around 3.18$LABEL$2
Didn't mind the high price! Dropped my vehicle off a week ago and am still waiting. Every time I call it's 30 more minutes. Will not be going back for any service. Even though I was referred by a friend of the owner$LABEL$1
This McDonald's has the slowest staff I have EVER seen. Absolutely pathetic!$LABEL$1
Drive-thru open 24 hours and the staff is always great.  One of the best McDonalds in the area.$LABEL$5
Having played Sunset Hills a number of times over the past two years$LABEL$2
Played a couple of rounds here to get a good feel for it.. and I'm not impressed.  Will likely not be coming back here.I'm +18 handicap golfer and I didn't like this course very much.  It's a pretty simple layout$LABEL$2
This place is best for its value - 30 bucks for 18 holes is pretty decent.  Unfortunately$LABEL$2
I came here for lunch$LABEL$4
Always enjoy the burgers and that's about where I call it quits. If you enjoy really good fried chicken$LABEL$3
LOVE circle G! I live nearby and it's always a great place to get some good ol southern food done right. Prices are super reasonable and portions are hugggge! the service is always great here. They sure do take care of you at the circle G!$LABEL$5
Good stuff - great service - big menu - looks like a lot of good options to choose from....and it is always busy$LABEL$3
Great as usual this a most for southern food. I always just trust the waitress (Liz and Christy) and their recommendations and the food is a blast! Not to mention the desserts. This is just a gem. Nice to see all the regulars eating.$LABEL$5
Old fashioned cafe. Simple meat and three menu plus a bunch of sandwiches. Massive amount of food. Most of patrons work nearby.$LABEL$3
Hey you know that sports bar with a just-okay beer selection but really yummy potato skins and ranch cheese fries and nachos that all of the teachers hang out at because they give them half off of those yummy apps?Oh yeah$LABEL$4
Sports Page is a West side classic. I have been eating there for many years. Way back when they were still in the original location at 16 and Hoskins. Anyway$LABEL$4
The several times I've been here or gotten food to go$LABEL$3
Sports Page used to be a fun spot & I've been going for nearly 10 years. I just recently moved to the area but used to travel to Charlotte to meet with friends & we would always meet there. The last 3 times I've went is was drastically worse. The bartender ignored us (each time)...It seemed like a bar where only locals are welcome. The food has gone downhill as well. I couldn't even finish the nachos...mostly because I had no drink to wash it down. They still have potential but I doubt I'll be returning.$LABEL$2
I have such fond memories of 1982.  I'm glad the Sports Page could bring them back with their assortment of old Sports Illustrateds and other sports pictures.  This place is cozy and friendly.  It's dated to...well...1982...and they weren't even located here in 1982.  I'm inclined to like places like this for that reason alone.The food is what you'd expect from a classic southern joint.  It's good$LABEL$3
The service was nice$LABEL$3
Horrible showers$LABEL$2
Unfortunately I found this hotel to be more like a motel. The room that I stayed in was so filthy and the odor was so grand I had to move to another room. The pool was dirty to the point the staff advised me not to let the kids swim until they had it cleaned. The housecleaning staff took it upon themselves to help steal my 7 yr.old daughter Kindle Fire after I left it in the room. And the hotel manager then advised me he did not appreciate the fact I contacted corporate. He also told me after several attempts to get this matter resolved that he did not appreciate me for slandering his hotel. I had to file a police report$LABEL$1
Stopped here on the way to Fort Jackson.  It's not in a great neighborhood & right off of the freeway so it's noisy. The staff was really friendly but the rooms were dirty. The shower looked like the showers in RV's.  we were supposed to stay for three days but after we saw people having relations in the pool at noon we decided it wasn't the safest place to be. The staff was very understanding about canceling our stay. I wouldn't recommend this place.$LABEL$1
WOW this place is a complete dive I don't even no where to start. Ok our hotel room smelled of marijuana and a bathroom cleaner combo. Then learned the bathroom door was a slider. Yup no door knob a hole for a finger slot. So when your in the bathroom you can watch tv. Not my type of place the shower is like an RV camper the neighborhood is terrible tour next to a Waffle House and jack in the box I put the ac on smelled like burning hair  I heard Police and fire truck sirens All night very noisy the next-door neighbor was either living there or been there along time tons of people coming and going must of been dealing drugs then breakfast was a joke hot pockets and water down waffles SMH shameful the lady stood there while we are preparing our food like a security guard overlooking everything making sure u didn't take two unsoft butter overall I would never recommend this$LABEL$1
The place a hole in the wall with handwritten signs all over the place. The food is decent at a fair price and the people are friendly. I most likely will return.$LABEL$3
This is the place for great priced hibachi. The selections are the same as those restaurants who put on a show (but also charge double for the food). The food is always fresh and the service is always friendly. I moved back here from California recently and I can say that I've really missed these guys! Would recommend to friends & family.$LABEL$4
Don't waste your time. Overpriced low quality hibachi. You can tell from the moment you walk in (cardboard handwritten signs screaming no return/ not responsible for food issues) that maybe you should turn around and leave. I however made the mistake of staying. I purchased the beef teriyaki combo (which was rung up wrong and had to be fixed after I waited for my food for 20 mins). The beef was over cooked and too lightly sauced$LABEL$1
This place is good if you want a quickie! Good Japanese hibachi and an inexpensive place. It is a simple restaurant with no fancy decor. No private parking. Large dining room and has public restrooms! Would recommend!$LABEL$3
Good food and good service$LABEL$4
My food was pretty good$LABEL$4
Have not been to this location in awhile.  I was very disappointed.  First the food took forever .  Both of us ordered pancakes mine was regular pancakes and my husband was blueberry . Mine looked fine but husband blueberry pancakes was undercook as far  very light in color and just a few blueberries just thrown in at the center.  I ask the server about it all she said that the pancake is upside down so that we would know it had blueberries in it. We ended not eating it.  Not good.The little bubble in my head said what does she mean by that response.  I figured the cook forget the blueberries at last minute .  Did not look like the menu pic.  Can't  believe that they serve us that. Oh$LABEL$2
They are too high! A Belgium waffle should not be $5! Sorry$LABEL$3
I didnt want to give them one star but didnt have a choice. Not good service at all went in on a saturday morning around 10 a.m got seated they didnt take our drink order just sat us with the menu. waited about 20 mins saw the waitress a couple of times never made eye contact with us then finally after 30 min of no drinks or any contact we got up and left manager was no where to be found.$LABEL$1
Such a great local coffee shop! Delicious pastries and great coffee selections. (They have coffee ice cubes in their iced coffee!) The staff is friendly and there is never a long wait. I uses to live in a city where there was a Starbucks on every corner. When I moved here$LABEL$5
First time stopping in today and won't be my last. Nice$LABEL$4
My father$LABEL$4
I visited Todd's Flowers in Plaza Midwood for two reasons:  1. To support a local business2. To get my wife a congratulatory bouquet for her new office.  As soon as I walked through the door$LABEL$1
My mom in Dallas$LABEL$2
Horrible service. Terrible showroom from 1980. Poor attitude by employee. $17 bucks for two balloons$LABEL$1
I wasn't sure about how much paint I needed so I asked for their recommendation and was very clear on what I was painting.  They said one gallon was plenty but even applying it super thin$LABEL$2
Associate was indifferent to my presence the day I went in.  No greeting$LABEL$2
Nurses at the front counter are a little spacey and slow but otherwise this urgent care is just wonderful. I asked the front nurse for some tips on preventing an infection I keep dealing with and she just looked at me blank and said she didn't know. I'm sorry but you're a nurse$LABEL$5
If I could give zero stars I would.  Waited almost a half hour for my number to be called to even be registered$LABEL$1
This is the worst Pizza Hut that I have ever ordered from. The pizza was cold and the sauce was nasty. The crust tasted like it had been sitting for days. The wings were sitting in pool of sauce and grease and the bone was red like it had been sitting in blood before it was cooked for a while. It was so nasty that I could not eat it because I thought I was going to get sick. I called the manager and her best idea was she could come and pick it up and reimburse me but it would be another hour or make me more. I will never order from there again and hope they get shut down.$LABEL$1
This is the worst pizza store in Charlotte. I have ordered from this location three times and they have never gotten my order correct. Ever. As the other reviewers noted the management is horrible and rude. Don't waste your money.$LABEL$1
This place is awful dont waste your money go somewhere else. delivery took almost two hours and pizza was cold. Not to mention my order was wrong. I used to work here many years ago i hate to see this franchise go down the toilet. DO NOT ORDER FROM HERE!!!!!!!!$LABEL$1
I only rated 1 star because I couldn't select a half or none.  Placed a delivery order at 5:30 and was told 30 minutes.  Called at 6:50 am was told it was on its way.  Called back again at 7:15 and it was not in the system anywhere and they have no record of it (after taking our credit card mind you).  Will never order from there again and suggest you use caution as well$LABEL$1
This is the best restauraunt I have eaten at in Charlotte. The food is really world class. The small 20 table dining room really makes it feel very warm and personable. Chef Bruce Moffett really pays attention to detail when preparing his dishes. Their signature starter in my oppinion are the mussels$LABEL$5
I was so excited to eat at Barringtons for my birthday dinner. I'd heard and read so many rave reviews$LABEL$2
I am a fan of Barrington's...but just barely.  The food here is good and it's probably one of the places in Charlotte you have to eat$LABEL$4
My wife and I came to Charlotte for a nice dinner at Barrington's but we were extremely disappointed especially with the service.  The food was good but my wife's duck was not prepared as she asked and when we were finally able to get the attention of our server she said that she put the order in for the duck to be medium taking no responsibility for how the duck was prepared and served.  I have had better service at the Waffle House.  In addition the wine was served by over filling the glasses so that she would not have properly attend to our table.   Attention to detail is what makes a good restaurant great.  Barrington's has a ways to go when it comes to service and attention to detail.  I do not recommend this restaurant if you want a great meal and with great  service as we had expected.   In sum$LABEL$1
This was just a fabulous restaurant - very intimiate - wonderful menu selection - great service - and just an overall great experience - strongly recommend listening to the staff  - they have great recommendations and great insight$LABEL$4
I can't comment on the food because we never made it that far unfortunately. Me and husband had gotten a babysitter (4 kids) and was so looking forward to going out to a restaurant that we hadn't eaten at before but when we arrived a lady explained that we didn't have reservations. I told her that I had made reservations on their web site (not open table or the like--but their reservation web site) but hadn't recieved any confirmation or e-mail that they were booked. I had gotten a little concerned a couple days before because I hadn't heard anything so I went in again and commented that I'd like a phone call or e-mail to confirm or deny but nothing again so we showed up hoping it was okay---the place had 2 people sitting in it at 6pm (our reservation time) and she said that they couldn't accomodate--even though there was 20 some tables empty--we were very upset by the lack of service and understanding--we love to eat out and do it quite often but will never go here again---Ruth's Chris down the road was very accomodating and the food was delicious!!!$LABEL$1
An absolutely great dinner experience. I went here with coworkers due to other yelp reviews . I got the gnochi and requested to have sausage with it as well. it was absolutely delicious. Also$LABEL$5
I chose this restaurant based off its Yelp reviews.  Wow$LABEL$4
Hubby and I really enjoyed this place. We will definately be going back. The menu looks rather limited$LABEL$4
Have only been once so far but it was wonderful.  The restaurant is very intimate$LABEL$5
I really enjoyed Barrington's the only time I've visited. The dining room is TINY to say the least and you obviously must have a reservation. My date and I brought our own bottle of wine$LABEL$4
Must have been an off night. My app was a tad fishy$LABEL$2
When my good friend notified me that Bruce Moffet had recently been recognized as one of the best chefs in Charlotte on the cover of Creative Loafing this month$LABEL$5
Meh.  That's how my wife and I would explain Barrington's as we came here after much hype for our anniversary dinner.  The waiter wanted to hang out and be our bud$LABEL$3
Always a great meal.  The menu changes seasonally$LABEL$5
First of all$LABEL$4
Agree with Jennifer the service was a big disappointment. The food was good. Presentation was nice. My Sirloin came out a bit on the medium side. I ordered medium rare. The highlight was the dessert.... Oh. Wine list is eh! Oh... So I should lower this rating. I guess a candle request was put in before we came.. It's my birthday and it didn't show.. Guess special requests should be confirmed. :(  no candle...$LABEL$3
we were so disappointed to not have eaten at your restaurant$LABEL$1
The JCC has a great gym. I highly recommend going to Lyn's zumba classes$LABEL$5
Played a recent tennis match here and the place is really nice. I would dare say is a massive complex behind the trees off Providence Road. Open for membership to everyone of culture and faith$LABEL$4
I have a new hangout when I feel the need to get out of the house and away from the office. This Caribou is in a small shopping plaza that most people probably breeze right past$LABEL$4
I absolutely love Caribou Coffee especially this location because it's located in the beautiful South Park/ Fox Croft area! The baristas here are super friendly and if your looking for a nice place to study or get work done on your laptop this location is not too noisy it has a beautiful cozy cabin feel to it!$LABEL$5
There are several Hickory Tavern locations in the Charlotte area$LABEL$3
I've got a lot of fond memories from Hickory Tavern. It just so happens to be right around the corner from my house$LABEL$4
Friendly staff$LABEL$3
The Fish Tacos are what brings me to Hickory Tavern for lunch. They are absolutely fantastic. However$LABEL$3
Good beer selection. Service sucks.$LABEL$2
Nice patio area.... when the weather is nice.  There was a decent crowd on the patio on a Monday night.  Absolutely dead inside though.Service was a bit confusing as we had 2 waitresses - but we were just there to drink and also eat a light dinner.I definitely recommend the Chicken Salad Plate....  good portioned salad and seasoned chicken salad also comes with a side fruit plate that was good.$LABEL$3
Since I live in South Charlotte (not because I want to)  I have had to come here for a drink or two every now and then.  The patio is pretty nice$LABEL$2
Stopped by tonight with a friend. We both ordered bottled beers. My bottle came with a \""Best consumed before May 11$LABEL$1
I have never eaten a full meal at Hickory Tavern$LABEL$3
Love going to this place. Excellent burgers and wings. Make sure to get the wings charred. Service was great especially by Jordan and Kaitlin$LABEL$5
I haven't been to this Hickory Tavern in years.  We used to go hit buckets of balls next door and then swing over for some drinks and dinner.  The years have been fine to this location$LABEL$4
This 4 star rating is based solely on the charred wings!  I've never gotten anything else!  If you don't know about charred wings$LABEL$4
Stopped here after dinner for desert. Had the brownie sundae. Brownie was warm and chocolate sauce was sweet but not syrupy. Waitress was courteous and efficient.$LABEL$4
I am by far the biggest fan of Hickory Tavern's build your own salad. I literally could eat it every day. At this location$LABEL$1
So bad compelled me to download yelp app and write review. Went for lunch with family (wife and 3 young boys). We've learned to not be picky as our crew can be a little rambunctious. First off in an empty restaurant we were seated directly next to the kitchen in/out door. Next the waitress spilled water on my wife and table. Then when asked what the specials were I was told \""um$LABEL$1
It's a hit or miss here depending upon what stuck up college kid you get serving you.$LABEL$2
How can you complain when it's all a DOLLAR ? I love this place !!! A dollar a hollar ! Yeah !$LABEL$4
I stopped by this restaurant for lunch the other day with 2 friends and was very impressed by all that they have on hand.  The menu$LABEL$3
I came back here today (6/21/2013) to grab a veggie griller sandwich for dinner with a side of potato salad (see picture).  When I walked in I was welcomed by the worker at the order counter. She was very courteous and nice$LABEL$3
I am not sure if it speaks to the location of the restaurant$LABEL$3
I had my first ever eye exam at Providence Eye & Laser Specialists$LABEL$5
- Excellent staff- Excellent service- Excellent patient care- Excellent technology- Excellent EXPERIENCE!No doubt about it$LABEL$5
This location isn't consistent. Sometimes our service/order filled/etc. will be perfect.Other times.... it leaves a bad taste in our mouth when we're driving awayThere is one lady that works at the drive thru that is so rude. I can't stand it. When we ask for condiments (ketchup or honey mustard..whatever) she always looks at us like we are aliens and gives us ONE. There are two of us and I'd like more than one packet of ketchup for my fries. And then when we ask for more than one she rolls her eyes and makes it a big deal.  I'm not asking you to stock my refridgerator up...I just want to eat my fries with a couple packets of ketchup$LABEL$2
This location is pretty much an accurate reflection of most of the MdDonalds in South Charlotte.. The associates are rude$LABEL$1
The associates are slow and rude. One time I ordered a bacon ranch salad with ranch dressing$LABEL$1
Chuck e Cheese is going to be Chuck E Cheese. Lots of germs spreading without a doubt but this is the only Chuck e Cheese I would take my kids to in town. It's overprice of course$LABEL$3
What can I say the kids love it and wouldn't know the difference if it did suck; in this case it sucked big time! None of the machines seemed to work properly at all. Plus like 80% of the games either ate my coins or did not give me tickets for my kids. I continuously had to call employees to either retrieve my coins or tickets. The games that did give you tickets were cheap as hell. You can't fool me chucky!! BUT THE KIDS!! SHAME ON YOU!! Your lucky to get a 2 out of 5! The best part was the McDonalds across the parking lot.$LABEL$2
Games are fun and my child enjoys it.  It is HOT and very crowded!  Lots of kids not be supervised.  Also$LABEL$3
Best of the best Chuckee's around.   A lot cleaner$LABEL$5
I typically wouldn't take the time to review a fast food chain but the overall experience was so terrible that my children wanted and insisted that I YELP about it.  When we walked in the door two of us almost busted our tails because of the wet and greasy floor.  There wasn't a caution sign indicating the floors might be slippery....definitely a lawsuit waiting to happen.  The service pretty much sucked.  The folks acted like they didn't want to be there and appeared bothered when we asked them for extras such as ketchup and hot sauce.  The guy in front of us left mad because they couldn't seem to get his order right.  As my son said their \""legendary sweet tea\"" wasn't very legendary.  It tasted old and not very sweet.  The fries were greasy and not hot (pet peeve of mine with french fries).  To top it off the place looked and smelled dirty.  Pretty unacceptable considering that it was dead in there.  Or maybe there's a reason for that....$LABEL$1
I wish I had read the previous review first.  My boyfriend and I were craving a Cajun Chicken biscuit for breakfast so he picked it up and brought it home.  The chicken was so dry$LABEL$1
I rarely crave Bojangles but I did craved some dirty rice over the weekend. 2 hours before close and I asked for the grilled chicken bites. They were out for night. I ordered an order of dirty rice. They were out for the night. I almost left but just ordered fried chicken tenders and too salty fries. I asked for a Sierra Mist fully expecting the fountain machine to be down or the Sierra Mist to be out. I'll probably try it again but if they fail a 3rd time$LABEL$2
I tried them again$LABEL$4
This was probably the worst bojangles I've ever been to.  First traffic makes getting in and out hard and when you do get inside you see a store that doesn't look like it's had a major cleaning or remodel in years.  I'm the only customer there is I go to the register and service was pretty apathetic with a hint of ghetto attitude for making them work.I get my order and see that all the tables are dirty and the floor hasn't been cleaned so it's a game of find the least nasty. Sit down and the sandwich is overcooked to the point of being rubber.  The fries were pretty average so I ate quickly and left$LABEL$2
Nothing really special about this place.  The bar food was probably a little subpar but I wasn't expecting much.  Thought the pool tables were pretty well maintained aside from the fact that there isn't very many pool tables to begin with. If you're looking for a typical place to hang out$LABEL$3
The service was friendly and the beer is cold. Have to give a thumbs down on the food though. I had the mahi mahi$LABEL$2
Here for Pool League game.  Most tables are well groomed$LABEL$2
It's nice to have a place that opens late on Sundays. We had some friends in from out of town and couldn't figure out what to do aside from the usual eating. One of my friends suggested Bailey's. I've never been$LABEL$3
This place is your typical sports bar... A ton of TVs and pool tables. If you are sports fan$LABEL$3
This is a sorority ran facility. I was uncomfortable the majority of the time I was there. Lots of pool tables is nice. The clientele is all male and I'm not surprised with the staff they have. I will not go back to this Baileys/Fox and the Hound.$LABEL$2
I usually hit this place on Mondays for their lunch special.  The burger and fries are some of the best I've ever had but the wait is what kills it.  I've never been in there and gotten my food in less than 45 minutes$LABEL$3
I have been going to Bailey's for two years to watch the UFC pay-per-view events.  Their food is good$LABEL$2
If your young and live in the Ballantyne/Pineville area this is a great spot! I reccomend Sunday Funday (a collaboration of karaoke/beer pong/pool/darts and great drink specials).  The staff is why I come back! (Jillian/Melissa/Lindsay/ Colleen and many more) The staff is friendly and personable.  It's honestly the Cheers bar of Charlotte. Super laid back and safe!$LABEL$5
Absolutely the worst bar I've been to . After about 5 drinks I realized they purposely made their drinks extremely weak. I spent so much money and barely got tipsy. I told the bartender I was disappointed with my drinks and she literally screamed at me as I walked out of the door ( I still left her a good tip!) I will never ever go there again. Trashy$LABEL$1
Went in the other day and it was my first time hearing that they were a private bar. I've been here about 5 other times through the year. I didn't want to sign any forms for membership that night$LABEL$1
Went to Baileys about a week ago to celebrate my birthday with some friends. There were four of us and two of us got up from the table to use the restroom. When we came back my best friends iPhone was no longer on the table. In a panic$LABEL$1
Your staff is horrendous to say the least. I will be filing complaints to the BBB$LABEL$1
This is probably some of the best Asian cuisine in Charlotte. The menu is comprehensive$LABEL$4
For an Italian-American$LABEL$4
Even with $30 Groupon for $15 its still overpriced....... Food is what you would expect from most fast food Chinese food places$LABEL$1
Wow!  Wan Fu is excellent.  The restaurant itself is huge and well appointed.  There is plenty of space for large groups.  We had a large group and ended up getting a ton of food and passing around.  One of my favorite dishes was a kind of duck taco.  It was delicious!  Everything else I tried was great as well.  Wan Fu is definitely a far cry from cheap Chinese buffets.  The service was very friendly and attentive and being locally owned is a big plus!$LABEL$4
Have been here twice on our drive back to New York from Florida.The first time we were very happy with the quality of the food. Flavor was excellent. Employees were friendly. Took a little longer that expected to get the food$LABEL$3
Consistently good food.  Outstanding service.  We love the Wan Fu Scallops and order it often.  Inexpensive bottles of wine are a nice plus.  Their portions are large and it is a cozy place.   Definitely give it a try.$LABEL$5
I tried Wan Fu back in August 2012 because of the rave reviews and friend recommendations. On the menu I noticed the prices are considerably higher than other Chinese restaurants in the area. Now$LABEL$2
From living in NYC for 27 years I tried this place and I took one bite and threw it all away. And very expensive$LABEL$2
This place is like Baoding in the South park area except more expensive. You can get pretty flavorful traditional Chinese dishes if you know how to ask for it. Other than that I think it is standard American Chinese food. The ambiance is nice$LABEL$4
Wan Fu is excellent. The food is atypical of your usual Chinese restaurant. They serve an outstanding variety of Chines food. Nothing here is common place.The service is marvelous.$LABEL$5
We have been coming for 10+ years and have enjoyed our visit up to now. Same d\u00e9cor which we like but a new menu. The new menu is laminated with that \""fish camp\"" design to it....cheesy. No longer are available are the Thai spring rolls with peanut sauce. Hot and sour soup still excellent. Smaller size portions are the pork fried rice (also excellent) and the bang bang shrimp now has fewer shrimp$LABEL$2
One of the best places in Charlotte! The chicken and broccoli was very good! The chicken and shrimp fried rice was good as well. It says 2 people could share one item.....not so sure about that.$LABEL$5
Food was okay.  I'm Asian and I am not discriminating when I say as most Asian restaurants$LABEL$3
I have been a long time customer of Wan Fu over the last 10 years and I must say last nights experience was pretty bad.  Christmas Eve$LABEL$2
Oh Wan Fu$LABEL$2
My husband and I have been going to Wan Fu for years. The food is fantastic$LABEL$2
Best Chinese restaurant hands down ! Food is always wonderful and wait staff all greet you like your family! You don't have one waitress or waiter - every wait staff will check on you and serve you or clear your table or bring you whatever you need! It's the most friendly hospitable group of waitresses and waiters I've ever encountered! The food is bar none the best. Meals I've had : lettuce wraps$LABEL$5
Good$LABEL$3
Wan fu is the best Chinese in the area ..I know my Chinese and this is the place to go and we do often . anything they make is great . sa cha scallops. Kung pao chicken . hot and sour soup . the dumpling/pot stickers are the way to start .. And the building its self is a site to see its very fancy'ish but they love the kids !! Lunch specials are cheap$LABEL$5
The atmosphere of this restaurant is five star.  Decor and lighting set a great mood. I actually felt a bit under dressed in a tee-shirt and jeans but I wasn't the only one dressed so casually.  The food was so so.  If you like Americanized Chinese you will be delighted as it was certainly a cut above most with that sort of menu.  I$LABEL$3
I love their ready made foods! It's a bit pricey with most items but I enjoyed a 1/2 turkey & swiss panini for ~$3.50 today. My husband devoured the most beautiful rotisserie chicken breast either of us had ever seen. If they sold Naked Juice$LABEL$4
IIt is more expensive than your average Harris Teeter$LABEL$5
Know what?You can't buy toilet paper at the Fresh Market. I hate that. Otherwise$LABEL$3
i was actually on my way to trader joes but fresh market was closer so i thought i would give it a chance. stupidly$LABEL$2
Go on the weekends for a surprise good time! Free wine tastings$LABEL$5
I usually go here after the gym for a quick snack. They have bulk salted almonds and chocolate coconut water that is great to tide me over before dinner. Fresh Market also has good options for dinner. They have several different types of chicken roll ups including chicken cordon blue$LABEL$4
I have been to this Fresh Market a lot over the years.  Back in the day it was the grocery store that was different.  Fresher$LABEL$3
My$LABEL$2
One of 2 locations in the Charlotte area if you're looking for inexpensive slightly used kids clothing$LABEL$3
Nothing overly nice$LABEL$1
No matter how often I'm there$LABEL$1
I've never tried to sell clothes here$LABEL$2
I've been here quite a few times and never had a problem here$LABEL$4
Don't get me wrong the food here is great$LABEL$3
***NOW CLOSED***I've been here twice and no complaints. Brought it home when my mom was visiting and she loved it.  The marinade on the chicken is wonderful.$LABEL$4
What a train wreck! I stopped in there for lunch at 11:15$LABEL$2
No way will I be back any time soon. My husband and I went here for restaurant week and we were very disappointed with everything. I was able to make a reservation easily at the last minute and I was glad I we did. The line was endless and crowded. We get seated and our waiter takes around 10 minutes for him to take our drink orders. Through dinner$LABEL$1
This is another restaurant I tend to eat at solely with my parents.  That's not really a bad thing; it's just not typically a place I would seek out on my own.Trio certainly has a few things going for it.  First$LABEL$3
A high three stars for Trio.  Nice bar$LABEL$3
The first time I ate here I loved it.  The second time I went$LABEL$2
I don't know why I keep going back to this place.  While talking to my wife about trying to find a home for a pit bull puppy$LABEL$1
When we first got in$LABEL$2
This is a bit of an odd one because the ambiance and decor don't match the food that we had.  We went for Restaurant Week and the $30 prix fixe for 2 ended up at $95 with the addition of 2 beers and a glass of wine$LABEL$3
This is one of my grandmother's go-to lunch restaurants$LABEL$3
Trios is always our go to place when we want a good meal$LABEL$5
Not a bad place to get lunch... Food was good$LABEL$3
I think I have woosah'ed enough over the past few days that I can write a relatively (that's subjective) coherent review of this place.I don't think I have been to Trio since it first opened many years ago (mid 90's?).  From my memory$LABEL$2
Trio is our girls' night out spot.  Jim. the bartender$LABEL$4
Mediocre food for the $$$ price but great atmosphere and service.  I had the filet because I was feeling picky about the amount of dairy in the other items.  But the steak wasn't nearly as good as anything I can cook at home.  Drinks and desserts however were well worth it.  I would come back to socialize rather than enjoy the cuisine.$LABEL$3
Best Reuben sandwich I have had in the Carolinas! Closest one to my favorite one at Carnegie Deli in NYC.$LABEL$5
I have liked trio since the mid nineties...I still do. Good food$LABEL$3
We ate dinner here yesterday and I can honestly say it was one of the better experiences I've had at a restaurant in a while.  The server was attentive and friendly (which for some reason is getting rather rare!) and the food was very tasty!  The salmon was cooked to perfection$LABEL$4
A nice diner with your average dinner decor.  It was very crowded so I assumed it would be a good place to eat. I had the brunch pizza which was pretty decent.  Nothing to write hope about but good.  They brought out dishes off assortment muffins before your meal and wow.  These little lemon poppy seed warm muffins were great! I don't know if they were homemade or not but they tasted great!  Hopefully I will be able to get back here and try more of the menu.$LABEL$3
Very disappointed. Oven wasn't working so no pizzas available. Had French onion soup. Not enough cheese and I think Campbell's soup is better. Over priced for average$LABEL$1
Good food$LABEL$4
Friendly staff!$LABEL$3
This store can be a bit overwhelming at times with all of the selections. I spent about 10 minutes wandering around looking for streamers and was never asked if I needed help finding anything. I finally found the streamers$LABEL$3
This chick fil a is extremely busy during lunch time! I came here with my mentor for a quick meal during a job. Lines were very long$LABEL$4
I love chick-fil-a and I really wish they were in New York. The prices are completely reasonable and the quality of food is so good! It would put McDonalds to shame. Their chicken nuggets and strips are so fresh it honestly gets me every time. Additionally$LABEL$5
I'm not a golfer but I can fully appreciate a pretty$LABEL$4
I attended a wedding reception here and it was a great facility for a dinner event.  Of course$LABEL$4
Horrible food.  I hate to rag this place but...The sushi is \""mall-quality.\""  It's not horrible$LABEL$1
My kids love this place and judging by the number of other families in the place their kids love it to. We usually split the meals between the kids and my wife and I split also. They give you so much food you can never eat it all. We've asked for special order food here before (due to food allergies) and they have bent over backwards for us. If you are looking for high end sushi or Japanese food this isn't your place. I'd say it is a nice place to take your kids$LABEL$3
My closest sushi is complemented by a neighborhood friendliness in the staff that makes the environment a great meal.I've never received an order of sushi from the chef$LABEL$4
Our favorite sushi restaurant in Charlotte$LABEL$4
I have to rate Kabuto on the level of all the other places in charlotte and surrounding and it certainly does not match up well at all . I did try their sushi and the teppanyaki. The sushi was basically grocery store level maybe even worse and the teppanyaki was overly salty. The quality of all there food simply was not there. They did put on a decent show though and I would recommend it for families with kids or if you live near by and do not want to travel to the other better places. Other than that they have similar prices to other places so it is a waste of your money.$LABEL$2
The japanese food here is nasty compare to other places in Charlotte. I've been here a couple of times with my co workers$LABEL$1
I've been to the University area and Tyvola locations and this year we tried this one for my oldest sisters birthday dinner with the fam.  I found a buy 1 get 1/2 off coupon online and brought it with me.  It was pretty empty at 5:30 on a Wednesday$LABEL$3
after my Liquid Diet at Mellow Mushroom and STILL craving Sushi$LABEL$4
Kabuto is one of those places I can come once a year and be done with it. Average Japanese Steakhouse experience.  The service is friendly and the food is good but it's just not as amazing of an experience as it would seem. The bar drinks are not very innovative and are just sugary mixers and liquor. The kids do enjoy the 'spectacle' of the noise and cooking but once it's over everyone is just sitting there eating around a huge table.$LABEL$2
Initial reaction upon walking in - in need of renovation.   I decided to stay as my daughter had never been to this type of restaurant.   Staff was very friendly (hostess$LABEL$2
Excellent food and service. The staff is very friendly and make you feel like home. I will recommend this please.$LABEL$5
If it were possible to give a restaurant a negative rating$LABEL$1
I remember coming to Kabuto and the chefs would actually entertain you - no matter how old you are. Nowadays$LABEL$2
Oh no$LABEL$2
When we came to Kabuto for lunch on Saturday we had in tow a couple of sad kids who had just been dealt a little bad news.  So we drove to one Japanese steak house for lunch; closed until 5:00.  Looking on our phones for a new place to go$LABEL$4
First off$LABEL$2
The service is a highlight. But the rice tastes... plastic-y to me. The paneer is very bland compared to what I've had at other restaurants. It left me missing Bombay Cuisine and wanting to try the Turkish restaurant across the parking lot. The sauces were really tastey and they do a good job of adjusting the heat up or down according to tolerance. The garlic naan seemed really thick- which could've been a fluke because I don't remember it ever being like that before. I've been here about 5 times.  Nice atmosphere$LABEL$3
The food and service here are both great.  Any dish you get will be unique and flavorful.  My favorite is the chicken vindaloo.  Be careful the vindaloo is extremely spicy.  They also have a fairly extensive lunch buffet worth checking out.$LABEL$5
Reasons I will never go to this restaurant again:-Out of all the empty tables$LABEL$1
Visited here for the first time on 1/21/2012 with a Groupon!Atmosphere was nice$LABEL$3
We have been dining at BG for several years now and it is still the best all around Indian experience we have found in Charlotte.$LABEL$5
I'm teetering between a 3 and 4...but I choose a 4 and I'll tell you why in a second.I came with friends a few Sundays ago and I fell in love with this type of buffet-I generally equate buffets with Golden Corral and run the other way.  For a newbie to Indian food$LABEL$4
First time eating Indian food.  Great staff great food.  clean.  All around excellent.  Can't wait to try it again.$LABEL$4
Great Indian food! There is always great food on the buffet. Great for take out or dine in. Kid friendly.$LABEL$5
Bombay Grille has excellent chicken korma. Their weekday lunch buffet has really tasty food as well. You can find authentic tandoori chicken$LABEL$4
Despite the atmosphere (not too inviting)$LABEL$3
After reading some of the reviews here on yelp$LABEL$2
I teeter between 3 and 4 stars on this review but I decided to be nice :)We almost missed it because the \""bomb\"" on their sign is not lit up so it says \""AY GRILLE\""  currently.  That almost turned me away.  I have this weird stigma with restaurants or shops that have half a sign lit up without fixing it.  It just seems so bootleg.  But$LABEL$4
Loved the lamb madras and the Peshawar Nann. The lamb was cooked well with just the right amount of spices. The peshawar nann was something I never had before. It was filled with shredded coconuts$LABEL$4
I love the food here!I have tried many dishes here and everything has been solid.  My favorites being the vindaloo$LABEL$5
I love Indian food$LABEL$2
Probably one of the worst Indian  food I have ever had in USA. Went there for Sunday buffet and the food was terrible. Serving is bad and avoid this restaurant.$LABEL$1
Tried takeout yesterday. One of the worst Indian meals we have had in a long time.- Lamb Kabobs - undercooked and falling apart. They may have run out of time or maybe they had too many takeout orders. No excuse. A big F for this.- Chicken Makhni - C minus. tasted bland for what is supposed to be a very flavorful dish. Very small portion. - Saag Paneer - C+ The paneer tasted rubbery. Good flavor though.One can understand$LABEL$1
Am less thrilled with Bombay Grill than I have been over the last 7 years of take-out$LABEL$3
All around mediocre experience. The app was slow to come out. The lamb roganjosh was under-spiced and the lamb was tough. Disappointing first Indian experience in Charlotte.$LABEL$3
Great service for the price point. friendly$LABEL$4
The food is not real Indian food$LABEL$2
Worst indian food I have ever eat in US.  If you read my review I bet you that you will regret if you give a try to this place. it's a joke of indian food. I have been eating paneer kadhai from 20 years and I know how it should taste. It was horrible. first time I went for dine in and the food was horrible$LABEL$1
I dropped into this place for lunch$LABEL$3
We were looking for a good Chinese place and I saw the reviews for Great Wall of China.  We decided to try it on Sunday after church. It  looked like it might be crowded with all the cars in the parking lot but when we got in the restaurant was bigger than it looks and it didn't feel cramped at all. Another surprise is apparently Sunday's they just do a buffet.  The inside was your typical American-Chinese restaurant look with the brass bars$LABEL$3
I've been going to this place for the past 15 years and it's definitely gone downhill recently. I used to rave about the food and service to all my friends$LABEL$2
Been coming here for years. Alex$LABEL$5
For Chinese food this place gets a three (3 yelp stars) from me.  I love the Chinese Cabbage and that was about it.  The Beef Dish I ordered was too salty and the Beef was over cooked though I do not think that was the determining factor   it tasted too plain  for my dish I rate it 2.55 yelp stars.  The Pineapple Fritters were perhaps made exactly as they were supposed to be though I did not like them.  The batter was too thick$LABEL$3
Meh exactly meh. Ive been here twice over the past 2 months or so....The first time there was a screaming kid there the entire time. Not the restaurants fault right? Yea technically i know but after 45 min of it$LABEL$2
I had checked out the reviews on Great Wall south$LABEL$2
I went to Great Wall for lunch since I was spending some time at Carmel Commons on patrol for my company. I hadn't eaten there in a very long time. I believe the last time I was there was at a Wednesday night supper with the Queen City Corvette Club. As I remembered it then the food was good but the service was iffy. Well fast forward to September 2012. The food is still good. I had a daily special called Twice Spiced Scallops that was rather good. Their sweet tea tasted better than say sweet tea from Cracker Barrel. I was seated next to the large aquarium. The only thing that wrecked the ambiance was the small child screaming at the top of her lungs about lobsters and the clueless parent who thought that the youngsters screaming was akin to angels singing. I would have ejected both of them.$LABEL$3
I went on a saturday night and was quite surprised that there wasn't anybody in there. The waiter wasn't exactly friendly but he wasn't rude either. My friend and I started with the egg rolls$LABEL$3
Stopped in for lunch$LABEL$3
This would be an A-OK (-).  We have been here a number of times over the past two years and recently moved back to the Charlotte environs.  So$LABEL$3
Not a bad chinese place. They had a buffet on Sunday which looked good although I choose not to go that route. The staff was very friendly and the place looked clean. I wonder about the bar area though. How long has some of those bottles been up there? Sesame Chicken- below averageEgg roll - Above average$LABEL$3
I came here with my in-laws to celebrate Father's Day. My Mother-In-Law called ahead and was told we could reserve the private room in the back. When we got there we were told that her name was mixed up with another woman$LABEL$3
There's a Chinese menu in addition to the regular menu$LABEL$3
We have been coming here for several years and the service and food varies to the day of the week and server. Week days are best$LABEL$4
We had some friends out shopping and told them about this good Chinese place. It was big$LABEL$2
This is the Real Deal. Classic American Chinese food served fresh and hot with excellent service. I can't believe that I had never eaten here until I got a Groupon. I even suffered severe\"" Groupon Guilt\"" when the meal was over and the check came. To be completely honest I could not bring myself to use it on my first visit. The food had been too wonderful. The wait staff was too good.  I ordered 3 entrees that day...figuring I would take home the leftovers. I had scallion chicken made with dark meat chicken (your choice)$LABEL$4
I've been going to The Great wall of China South for quite a while. The owner Alex and the staff always accommodate to your liking. I am a pescatarian so I don't know how their meats are however I can tell you about a few of their dishes. My all time favorite dish is one of their specialties the \""Crispy Scallops\"". The portion size is very generous & the scallops are sweet. This does not come with any vegetables. I recommend ordering the mixed vegetables with brown sauce. I always tell them to make the sauce spicy :) For appetizers the \""Steamed Veggie Dumplings\"" are amazing with a sweet soy sauce. The \""Crab Rangoon\"" is okay. The \""Spring Rolls\"" are greasy but good. Make sure to have extra napkins. Also I've tried the \""Sa Cha Scallops\"" during lunch and definitely a yummy dish! Although I like it very spicy. The restaurant is always clean and they have stayed consistent on everything for many years. Love this place!! Always keeps me coming back$LABEL$5
Excellent choice.  Food was tasty.  Portions were plentiful.  Service was attentive$LABEL$4
I have been going here for many$LABEL$2
Absolutely horrible experience. We were seated and drink order was taken by that person. Few mins later drinks were dropped off by a different person who said waitress would be over to take our order. Then 10 mins later someone came over and asked us if we wanted appetizers which we did and ordered Crab Rangoons and Spare Ribs. This person said someone would be back to take our order. Never happened. The apps came out and the guy said again someone would come take our order. So we ate our apps and still no one. No one even acknowledged us$LABEL$1
This place is bad! The service is bad$LABEL$1
No go. Bought the Groupon despite the other reviews and decided to give this place a try. The location$LABEL$1
Since 1985 Great wall has focused on quality and great food. I live about 30 min away now and still come here to eat. Passing at least 10 other Chinese restaurants.$LABEL$5
Gone downhill.  Service was awful.  Ordered soup$LABEL$2
I can only comment on carry out. I have ordered carry out food from here a number of times and am always impressed. I typically get a shrimp or chicken dish$LABEL$4
Great Wall has been in Charlotte longer than me - I got here in 1987 ! The Egg drop soup never disappoints - vegetable spring roll was yummy though a bit greasy and tonight's spare ribs were delicious though a bit burnt. Service is always good and the food for American Chinese is always good.   Over the past few years the food isn't up to where it was in the 80's(seems the quality has dropped)  but for American Chinese food it is good.  The restaurant is clean and the staff are eager to serve you.   Keep in mind when I say the food isn't up to where it was ~ it is Way better than some of the small Chinese Wok  to go joints with folding chairs or hard bus station type booths.  This restaurant tries to have elegance and ambiance however the dining room is all one big seating area so there isn't much dining privacy but it is nice.  The \""to go\"" line is always busy - so apparently  most of the  locals all carry  home rather than dining in ! I am completely guilty of doing that too ! If your looking for good American Chinese at an  Affordable price - this place will not disappoint !Not the best in Charlotte but certainly a nice change if your looking for somewhere different to eat.$LABEL$3
I called about 930 and the nice man ordered my food as the last order. I was starving Marvin and they were the only place to stay open and take my order. Such great people. And even better food. Must eat$LABEL$5
My husband and I went this past Saturday for dinner. I saw a few Chinese people there eating and thought to myself this food will be great. Because I usually judge a restaurant for being authentic if their own people go. I was wrong. The wait staff leaves a lot to be desired$LABEL$2
Great for large groups! They have rooms with tables that can accomodate up to 12 at one table equipped with a large lazy susan. Food is also usually fast. I say usually as one dinner trip$LABEL$3
Bedbathandbeyond is usually my last choice when searching for home goods.  Their prices are always higher than everywhere else$LABEL$2
Two things hit me when I walked in here.  The decor and the delicious smell.  First off the elaborate wood carvings and other ornate decorations really set the mood for a good meal.  Then there was the food itself.  It was actually pretty good$LABEL$4
Decor may look pretty legit$LABEL$3
Not my favorite place$LABEL$3
Hubby loves this place...I however do not really care too much for it. The curries are too sweet and their stirfry's are always packed with too much cabbage! and I mean raw cabbage. I also don't understand how they expect us to eat dry stirfry with rice.  We eat here if hubby has serious thai food hankering and I have decided to stick with their noodles which are actually decent.$LABEL$2
This is one of my favorite thai restaurants. Best pad thai in town. The food and service is always great and they have huge portions. I am a big fan of art and mainly oriental artwork and this place is full of it. The wood work in this place is unreal. Even if you do not like Thai and appreciate good artwork I would strongly recommend going into this restaurant and checking it out.$LABEL$4
Stumbled across this place almost by accident$LABEL$4
Went again this past weekend and it's official- I'm in love! Excellent Pad Thai$LABEL$5
Fellow Yelper Elisa S. & I have been here 2 times in 7 days for lunch - that's how MMMMM this place is! The lunch specials are just hands down hard to beat. With soup$LABEL$4
Went to Thai House on a Thursday around 8PM.  A few others were in the restaurant but not crowded at all.  Like other reviewers$LABEL$2
I've been here a few times and it was pretty decent. The food is alright$LABEL$2
I stopped into Thai House for lunch on a Saturday afternoon.  The restaurant wasn't very busy and I was seated right away.  The decor is very interesting$LABEL$3
I never quite understand why some people look so miserable... especially when one works at a restaurant$LABEL$2
I picked up take out for lunch on the way back to the office after an appointment today.  They are really fast with take out orders and my food was ready in under 15 minutes.  Instead of just getting an entree which I would normally do$LABEL$4
Excellent every time. Try the Green Curry$LABEL$5
I LOVE great Thai food and I have eaten here a few times$LABEL$4
I usually cringe when I hear or read someone say the word \""delish\"" but I'll have to use it for this restaurant. I'm a bit of a newbie with Thai food and I've rarely ventured outside of this place's Chicken Pad Thai just because it's soooo damn good. Nothing like slathering it with sides of jalapenos and spices given for that added extra bonus. Coming on a Thursday at lunch is the \""must\"" day because they have the best Egg Drop Soup I've ever tasted (and it's free with your meal). If a fruity-Asian hybrid of iced-tea is your thing$LABEL$4
Not bad for Thai food if your in the area. Offers decent lunch specials that include soup$LABEL$3
Stopped by for lunch today.  Except I didn't realize they don't serve lunch on the weekends.  They serve brunch.  The single sided paper menu offered ten to twelve different options to choose from$LABEL$3
Nice decoration feels cool and the foods is ok$LABEL$3
Goooood Thai place.$LABEL$4
Best I've tasted in Charlotte thus far!$LABEL$4
We have visited this place now couple of times. The folks are very cheerful here and the wooden sculpture of chain of elephants is cool. On our quest for finding places that offer vegetarian choices$LABEL$4
Okay so I've eaten here a few times now and I feel it's time to review.  I'm not a fan really. Every food experience I've had here has been mediocre$LABEL$2
Not sure why the $$ this place is over priced and bad bland food. 12.95 for beef basil? They don't use real Thai chili peppers$LABEL$1
Decent Thai food and decent service.  The inside of the restaurant feels \""more Thai\"" than other places I've been to in Charlotte with a more traditional feel.  I dig the dude in the front with the MC hammer pants in purple seating everyone.  That was pretty fun.  I actually went for pho$LABEL$3
I got take out from here today for lunch and it was ok.  Portion size was good but I'd prefer to go to pei-wei. Their food is a lot bettee plus thai house messed up my order.$LABEL$2
This used to be our go-to place for Thai$LABEL$3
I ordered vegetarian pad Thai and if was pretty tasteless$LABEL$2
Went here yesterday for lunch! Their lunch prices and portions are the best!-First you get some type of soup...they change it every day. We had some type of rice and chicken. It is always broth based.-I ordered the Red Curry Chicken dish. The curry sauce was nice and watery with a creamy cocounut taste. Pour the bowl of chicken and red curry over the rice and then enjoy! The small spring roll was a nice little touch and very good!They are quick serving and are a great lunch spot option!$LABEL$4
Great food for the price.  I enjoyed their vegetarian options especially the pad Thai. Love the inside. Great service as well.$LABEL$5
The Thai carved wood and overall decor is amazing- and the service was fine. Sorry to disagree with others$LABEL$2
First time going and I loved it! Will go again soon. Only complaint was they got our duck orders on medium heat when they were supposed to be mild. But I still liked it$LABEL$5
I am 8.5 months pregnant and ordered green curry for take out from here. When I placed the order$LABEL$1
Amazing food and a beautiful atmosphere! I got a delicious coconut dish that tasted like heaven. The sweet tea tastes like green jasmine tea which is a nice new flavor and goes well with the cuisine. However it was really really sweet and they kept refilling our glasses without asking$LABEL$5
Exquisite. Beautiful interior$LABEL$5
I've been going to the Thai House about once a month for over a year now. I love it! I've tried a number of other Thai restaurants in the area and this is my favorite.I often bring friends and no one has ever disliked their meal here. My favorite things to get are the Pho and the Green Curry (which is really spicy). The food is always great. The service is even better than the food. They are always prompt and friendly. Most times I am surprised at how fast the food comes out. After going here a while they treat you like family. I would definitely recommend it to others!$LABEL$5
The urge to consume Thai food has hit once again and once again we are back at Thai House. Though it was crowded tonight we were given a booth right away. I've ordered Thai ice tea$LABEL$3
Tried a different Chinese Restaurant in the area and wish I did not. Got shrimp with mixed vegetables. The shrimp were small and very overcooked (very mussy). Also got the Teriyaki beef which  was like shoe leather (very tough). Will not be going back.$LABEL$1
Read review prior but my aunt wanted to eat so figured they may have improved since last reviews. Nope. Hot and Sour soup was bland. Crispy noodles were stale. My Sa Cha \""spicy\"" dish was missing the spice and broccoli in dish was visibly old. Should have followed my Yelp-stincts.$LABEL$1
It was awful.  not even sure that it was beef.  really$LABEL$1
Let me start out by saying that many of the reviews here are unfair. I live very close to this take out Chinese restaurant and have used them many times over the years. It is true that they were better before the change in ownership but they are still pretty decent. This place like many Chinese restaurants does some things better than others. For instance$LABEL$4
This place was ok.. could have been great. It took 20 minutes for us to even put our order in$LABEL$3
Best thing about this place - it was convenient to the shopping I needed to do at the Arboretum!Food is only fair - burger was pretty flavorless and dry.  Onion rings were awful - crunchy on the outside but mushy and wet (actually had onion \""juice\"" or water run out after biting in to one) on the inside.Service was ok.  My only complaint is that the server left the check on the table before asking for dessert orders.  If it was a.) busy and b.) we appeared to be a business lunch (not likely - me and the parents) I would understand that move.  But the restaurant wasn't busy - worrysome at 12:30 pm on a Friday - and we obviously were not a business group.Thought it was overpriced too - almost $9 for a dry tasteless burger with a side of onion rings and $5 for a chocolate malt?  Would not rate it a great value.Fake 50's decor and kitsch - primary reasons for visiting here.  Need more really GOOD casual (not fast food) eateries near the Arboretum.$LABEL$2
This place reminded me of the neighborhood diners of old.They serve breakfast and burgers and other diner fare.While the food was pretty good the service left a little to be desired did not have the excessive wait as other posters{thank goodness)but was disappointed with the friendliness of the server in general.If your planning on grabbing lunch have patience because they have pretty heavy lunch traffic.$LABEL$3
The food is actually fairly mediocre.  But with an endless supply of buy one/get one coupons they distribute$LABEL$2
What's up Richie Cunningham?  Not to offend$LABEL$2
This isn't my usual Lowe's but the one I wanted couldn't find the lumber that I needed so they sent me here. Where we learned that railroad ties are stored outside because a) they weigh too much to steal and b) they stink to high heaven.The people were very friendly and offered to help me load the dang things but I realized quickly that there was no way I could get them out of my car when I got home. Hell$LABEL$3
My husband and I have always been big fans of Lowe's$LABEL$1
It was an overall bad experience here.  The tables were sticky.  The glasses were dirty. The service was slow and the food was tasteless.  I would probably not return here.$LABEL$1
Let me start by saying$LABEL$3
The wait was over 30 minutes and the waiter was next to the worst. Even the mgr offer us a free dessert$LABEL$1
I frequent this location often as a great place to get a quick lunch that is not \""fast food\"".  Today however I think was not a gear experience.  The food was ok$LABEL$2
I can't tell you how the food was because after waiting 10 minutes (with no line) to get a table$LABEL$1
Robert is our waiter. He made some really good table side guacamole for us. We had no wait to get a table and we're seated immediately. I ordered a lemonade and a mushroom swiss burger. My wife ordered sweet tea and chicken crispers. The guacamole was very filling. Now to see what the burger tastes like. It's average$LABEL$3
\""So many friends$LABEL$4
I had breakfast here this morning$LABEL$4
Manger greated us soon as we walked in$LABEL$4
I believe I was the first Yelper to give this place a 5 star review.  I used to love this place and came here every time I came back to Charlotte from the west coast.  However$LABEL$1
I got the club. Being as though I am from Jersey and our club is turkey without ham the sandwich was ok. I feel that kraft singles do not belong on any sandwich whatsoever so I was taking that off my club. The fries were horrible. They reminded me of when BK changed their fries to that weird crispy and then over cooked. French fries should be easy...dont get cheap on the fries and dont put kraft singles on sandwiches. Judy is a great waitress. She was extremely friendly.$LABEL$2
Unfortunately I didn't even get to try their food as I was ignored when I entered by I'm guessing the manager or host woman.  I stood there as she looked at a phone after helping another guest. Then some guests entered behind me and she said hello to them immediately and then looked at me and said$LABEL$1
I'm not even sure where to start.  Horrible!$LABEL$1
Good ol' fashioned diner food with friendly service.  Though they could use better coffee from a local roaster.$LABEL$4
Very upsetting!  Park 51 cafe is under new management.  Some of the new staff not near as friendly.  Norman$LABEL$1
I ordered delivery this evening and I must say that I was pleasantly surprised at the level of customer service on the phone and at my door. I usually get my Chinese take out from best wok 2 and they pale in comparison to lotus 2. I ordered the exact same things that I usually order from best wok and everything tasted better and was of better quality and was even a little less expensive. I am so happy that I've found a new Chinese take out. And they deliver! Of course its not P.F. Changs. But its well worth what you pay.$LABEL$5
As far as fast-food takeout Chinese$LABEL$5
So I have ordered from them many times over the years and got the food quickly; food was so so$LABEL$1
I was afraid of ordering from this place for no good reason....but now this is our go-to takeout Chinese place when we're feeling lazy.  I always order the steamed dumplings (kids love them) and the Delight of Three dish$LABEL$3
Good value Chinese food. Baoding is much higher quality but the price point and convenience is hard to beat at Lotus II.$LABEL$3
Not good. Sanitation score 90. The whole place$LABEL$3
Recently moving to the area$LABEL$3
I dunno if I just get bad luck but I'll never order from this place again. I keep giving it a chance but this was the last straw. Twice I have ordered from here and found metal from scrub pads in the lo  mein noodles. I luckily did not ingest it which would have possibly torn up my intestines. When I brought the metal in and showed them they offered to rebook another order. I don't think anyone really understood the seriousness of this. I told them it was the premise of it. That is a hazard not someone complaining about the tastiness. I got a call saying they would give me a $10 credit if I came back. To be honest I was offended and just shook my head. So I though 4 months later since this place is literally right around the corner I'd give it a try. This time honestly it just tasted aweful. It tasted like everything was cooked in a pan with something that was burned before. I am not being picky here it literally tasted like I was sacking on a charcoal briquet. I'm pretty much done with this place and question the quality of food ordered and hygiene practices. Chinese restaurant are notorious for bad sanitation scores and this place is clearly pushing it. For your own health as far as eating metal stay as far from this place as you can. I'd rather get frozen Chinese from grocery store and microwave and it would be better.$LABEL$1
What happened lotus cuisine? You used to be OK but now you just don't care anymore. The last 3 dishes I've ordered from you tasted awful and the local me in in particular had as much flavor and eye appeal as a cup of water. You no longer deserve my business.$LABEL$2
I had been to the University location several times and that one is great.  The one in Pineville$LABEL$3
Good Hibachi$LABEL$4
We have eaten here uncountable times typically about 6-8 times a year. And after our experience on Saturday my husband refuses to go back. The portions were tiny$LABEL$2
This is one of my favorite places to eat since I was a kid growing up here in Charlotte. We still go there a few times a year as a family when we have a large group together. Great place for birthdays as well. Always seems like the food is consistent and has remained solid over the years. Ingredient quality is much higher than other Hibachi places I have been to. Service is accommodating.  Recently I have been hitting the sushi bar sometimes and we have been very pleased with the nigiri and rolls. We have tried some of the newer sushi places that keep popping up but have realized that we should stick with Nakato's.$LABEL$5
We went to Nakato last night for dinner.  The food was average in taste$LABEL$2
Very busy place for rather mediocre food. We rarely eat at hibachi grills$LABEL$2
I went here with a friend$LABEL$3
My husband and I came here on a Wednesday night because we had a Groupon for $30 worth of food.The Groupon said to call ahead with a reservation and to  mention the Groupon$LABEL$3
Found this place on yelp as we arrived in charlotte 4pm with our 5 yr old and 2 yr old.  Figured they'd like hibachi...we were right!Service was great$LABEL$4
Decent prices$LABEL$2
I enjoyed the show$LABEL$4
Love this place$LABEL$5
Far better than it's competition just down the street! I've eaten here many times and have never once had a single complaint! The quality and quantity of the food is fantastic! The sushi is superb! The staff are welcoming and efficient! The only thing I would tweak would be the decor. The carpet should be removed because I've been coming here for years and it's always been the same$LABEL$4
My husband and I are sushi lovers and we sat at the sushi bar. The sushi chef Jin was very experienced and delivered some delicious rolls and nigiri.. The management was also friendly and conversational$LABEL$4
One of my familiy's favorite places to eat. Ever. Armed with this knowledge I was bracing myself for an... interesting experience. Hibachi is generally standard across the board for me. It's not a hit or miss type of cuisine. In terms of the actual hibachi$LABEL$3
This little Thai treasure consistently delivers!  I have ate there and had carry out many times.  The service is excellent$LABEL$4
This is probably a better place for lunch than dinner.  The lunch menu is reasonably priced and has eight traditional Thai dishes a day$LABEL$3
Lunch here is soo good!  Their house noodles are amazing. They are perfectly spiced and cooked everytime!  Comes with soup$LABEL$5
We really wanted to like is place. We have yet to find a really excellent Thai place in charlotte. We ordered take out of pad Thai$LABEL$2
These guys have the best scallops I've tasted in a landlocked area! I don't know how they do it. House Noodles with Scallops is a must try!!$LABEL$4
I was really disappointed in this place. I had heard it was good$LABEL$1
Pretty good experience I had with my friends the other night. They close at 9:30 and we got there about 8:50$LABEL$3
Even though I've lived just down the street for 8 years$LABEL$3
Nice atmosphere. Soft music and no televisions. A lot of food for the price. Pad thai was kind of bland. Good spring rools and thai iced tea. Attentive staff.$LABEL$3
We ordered delivery from them tonight and we are so disappointed ! Coconut soup is too creamy$LABEL$1
The store is kind of small$LABEL$2
The Book Rack is squeezed in older shopper mall in Pineville$LABEL$3
Pretty good selection of used books especially in the fiction$LABEL$4
This little take away counter is overlooked  and some people might not even know it exist$LABEL$4
The food here is decent$LABEL$2
Precooked noodles in Ragu like sauce.  I got the Thai food (Phod Thai).  Don't do it!  There was a sprinkling of vegetables and not much else.  I asked for extra lime and onion and they gave me a tiny end of a lemon (not a lime) and no extra onions.$LABEL$1
I feel like discount or bargain stores like Burlington Coat Factory are a hit or miss. Sometimes you luck out with incredible stuff and other times$LABEL$2
Just a heads up$LABEL$3
I popped in here looking to see if they had any antenna balls. They were out and were getting new ones in$LABEL$3
Gluten Free/Allergy SensitiveEveryone knows outback but$LABEL$3
Love the kooka wings! I wish they would bring back the spicy new egland clam chowder! I can just eat appetizers and be happy!. I am a sucker for prime rib$LABEL$5
I have always been an Outback fan. For a chain restaurant$LABEL$3
Outback food is fairly consistent.... Not bad for a Sunday night takeout....however they consistently FAIL to give us everything we order.  This was our last takeout night from them....  Shame....matching what's in the bag doesn't seem to be that difficult to me.$LABEL$2
My wife and I ate here this evening for our 15th anniversary.  The interior had changed drastically since our last visit in terms of decorations. The menu had also changed with some items doubling in price.  A coworker of my wife had given her a $25 gift card for Christmas.We ordered sweet teas and a Bloomin onion. The onion had a definite spicy taste to the batter that reminded me of old bay seasoning.  My wife had the chicken tenders and I had the pork tenderloin.  It wa a good but wasn't outstanding. At one point during the meal a skinny white guy knelt next to our table. He didn't introduce himself. He asked about our meal and disappeared. I told the waiter about him. We were both too full to have dessert on this outing but the French toast bread pudding looked delicious.$LABEL$4
I was so pleasantly surprised!!I had such a nice experience at the bar in this ridiculously packed restaurant!  I stopped into outback for dinner because of the Outback Bowl deal - free bloomin' onion with any purchase!  Yes.  Yes$LABEL$5
Ordered take out and wanted mashed potatoes....they have me a baked potato. I know it's not too big of a difference...but taste and accuracy are important to me. I waited over 30 minutes for my food that was supposed to take 15-20 and it was extremely cold. I work in the restaurant industry but I make sure my product is accurate and hot when it leaves the restaurant. I also ordered 2 breads with it and only received one. I'm extremely disappointed in this restaurant and it's not the first time I've had a problem.  Not just in this location but in a couple others.$LABEL$1
After having a sub par meal last night a table that wasn't bolted to the base took a tumble and i ended up at urgent care for stitches.  The owner didn't bother comping our meal ($135) and my MIL had to fight for her to bring it down.  She ended up paying $24. What an insult.  Then$LABEL$1
Sllooooooww service - make note Dinner here last night for my daughters birthday. Just three adults and a baby$LABEL$3
So dinner was filet & lobster$LABEL$5
To take a step away from the more authentic Mexican places we've been eating lately$LABEL$4
Was in town for a 2 day visit and stopped by this place for lunch with 2 guests.  We were in a bit of a hurry as we had a meeting scheduled in about an hour.  Food was quite good and fresh.  Service was excellent and speedy.  We had some of the lunch specials and they were very reasonable.  Would definitely stop by next  time in town.$LABEL$3
Went here for lunch today. A big \""A-OK\"". Nothing special$LABEL$3
I go here alot cause its right down the street and the waiters/bartenders are so cool.  I also eat the bean dip and one of the shrimp dishes.  Food is always consistent.$LABEL$4
The Food was good.. However$LABEL$2
Salsa's has been at this location for a long time.  I believe they just changed the name to Cabo's.  The remodeled and added a stage for live entertainment.  I have been there several times.  I have discovered that branching out from the standard taco/enchilada/burrito is the way to go here.  I really like the Chile a la Mexicana$LABEL$3
First off$LABEL$2
This is now called Cabo's Mexican Grill. This is the 2nd time visiting and 2nd time being disappointed. The first time I went with a group of 3 other friends. The service was less than okay and food was mediocre$LABEL$2
I think they must have changed owners. The place looked completely different. The service was slow. I ordered a lunch plate of taco$LABEL$1
Always a pleasure to come here!  Genuinely awesome staff$LABEL$5
Super friendly place!  I started getting my cut and color done here and went a few times before I felt I could submit an accurate review.  They do not use Aveda products FYI.   I love the hours - they are open super early so you can get your appt finished and then pop into work!   Great views of College and 3rd street while you get your hair cut.  They are right above Panera in Charlotte Plaza.  if you are parking probably you would want BB&T garage and then walk across the street.Price ranges for services run the gamut - they are willing to work with you though - just ask!  :-)$LABEL$3
I would not recommend Uptown Retreat. First$LABEL$1
This place is alright.. It not what you would expect from Starbucks though.  They are usually much more spacious and helpful.. The staff here is snippy and not friendly.  Hey.. Free Wifi!!  Cant complain about that.. I am yelping from here right now.. But it makes me wanna go try Caribou Coffee.  Eh..-Ian M.$LABEL$2
Starbucks - meh.  I've definitely had better. I prefer local$LABEL$2
This is location always has 5 or 6 people in line from 7:45 to about 9am every morning Monday thru Friday. This day I decided to brave the line because I got there at 7:30. I understood why the line is always long. There were 3 people working$LABEL$3
Let me just say$LABEL$4
It's a Starbucks like every other Starbucks$LABEL$3
When in doubt$LABEL$4
The best way I can think to characterize Showmars is that it's kind of like that girl/guy (maybe an ex) who has evolved into a fairly reliable 11PM hookup when you can't find anything better. The familiarity harbors comfort. The basic need gets satisfied and sometimes it is simply mind-blowing. But when you're done$LABEL$3
Solid gyros. Tasty and they serve it up QUICK at lunch time.Don't eat it for lunch$LABEL$3
Good solid home style food at a very reasonable price served in a place that is quite possibly the friendliest I've ever experienced in CLT... honestly. The overwhelming majority of patrons are on a first name basis with the staff. ~Mel's diner... renamed Showmars$LABEL$5
This version of Dick's doesn't get me excited. Well...no version of Dick's gets me excited - but you can avoid this location and fear no missed opportunity.This is a scaled down version with not much selection$LABEL$2
Bank of America  ah yes the power of Ken Lewis squirming his way out of insider trading while he buys $100++ trash cans for his office and lays people off . Go figure ... screw the little guy. My trouble with B of A started I guess about well maybe 4 months ago . I decided on a Disney vacation and went on their web site ( Disney ) and booked everything with my Visa check card that is supposed to have fraud protection well it seems that the call center that Disney was using for these transactions had a team of scum bags that stole peoples credit card #s . Ok so I normally check my balance about every day or so anyway I checked it must have been 3 days after I booked and I had 3 charges one for nearly $10$LABEL$1
Convenient location... traffic pattern around the location is a downer though!  Way way back in the day$LABEL$3
I didn't not go to this branch specifically but I am writing a review on Bank of America in general not happy with here customer service. When trying to say something they pretty much tell you are even though I have papers in front of me showing when stuff have gone through and they are telling that stuff went through a different way. All I wanted was the fee taken off but they didn't even try they said they couldn't. I acknowledged I was going to go negative no matter what but it should of been a lower amount them what I was charged. Leaning toward leaving Bank of America because of poor service. C$LABEL$1
This week$LABEL$2
These days we only seem to see shows \""out\"" when we get tickets to a preview screening (thanks$LABEL$3
Several years ago I grew weary of our movie-every-weekend habit. Not so much the price$LABEL$4
It's not the best theater in the world but for a Sunday matinee it's perfect. The concession stand does not offer a huge variety and it's in a very weird location... right in the middle of the place when you walk in. But they have the basics$LABEL$3
I feel like I'm in the 80s at this movie theater . This place is in need of a major renovation and carpet cleaning$LABEL$2
I have been frequenting Zapata's for years and I love it! My favorite is the street tacos which are always fresh and delicious. I have never been disappointed with my food at Zapata's and I know many people who are patrons as well. It is a really large restaurant so there is always seating available. The service is always great. I can't say enough good things about it. I am a big fan of Mexican food and I have tried a lot$LABEL$4
Decent food$LABEL$4
This place serves Mexican with a Spanish bent. I've been here for dinner dozens of times over the years$LABEL$4
I have yet to find a dish I like there. I feel like there are better places for Mexican besides here. Food was mediocre I thought.$LABEL$2
My new coworkers invited me to go get \""cheap mexican\"" with them for lunch. Now$LABEL$2
I was pleasantly surprised by this place after going here for lunch.  For some reason I thought Zapatas was \""upscale\"" mexican (with upscale pricing) but I was totally wrong.  I think this is due to the fact that the only other location I know of is in Ballantyne and things tend to be a bit elevated whenever you go to that end of town.There's a decent lunch menu offered to go with the complementary chips and salsa - which was awesome.  I'm a huge cilantro fan and you can tell they make their salsa fresh (not out of the bottle).I had a chicken taco salad and was surprised at how big the lunch portion was.  It was packed full of chicken and the sour cream and guacamole was off to the side so you can choose to make your salad \""even healthier\"" if desired.Service was great and quick.... definitely a great spot for lunch and I am assuming a good spot for dinner as well.$LABEL$4
Was taken here for a work lunch the other day.  The food was reasonably tasty but unexciting.  When I order carnitas$LABEL$3
OK Mexican dishes. Not authentic but good and tasty. Quick fix if your in that neighborhood.$LABEL$2
Not the best mexican restaurant. The food was very bland and a little bit over priced for what it really was. I ordered pollo fundido which is pretty good$LABEL$2
Terrible$LABEL$1
Terrible.  The food is bland and boring.The service was fast and friendly$LABEL$1
Fist I will say the staff is friendly and the patio has a great view. They have pretty good drink specials. Really the only reason I would ever come here again is to drink on their patio.The food is quite bland. I mean$LABEL$2
Um...no!Chips are obviously from bags.  Salsa were runny and definitely not spicy.  (Remember - \""made in New York City?!?!?)I had the carne asada.  It was ok.  I usually devour the entire place but I just couldn't get into it.  The rice was bland.Overall$LABEL$1
I've eaten here for years.  I used to like it alot.  But over the past year or two$LABEL$1
The food is average americanized mexican but the service can be improved. Although the waiter was prompt$LABEL$3
This place has authentic Mexican cuisine. I came here with my sister who has been talking about the wonderful food here.We tried the vegetarian fajitas and Mexican stir fry. Both were delicious. Their tortila chips were served hot and the salsa was a little different but okay. The servers were courteous and the service was pretty quick. I will visit this place again!$LABEL$5
One of my favorite spots in university to have s good time! The service is fast and the food is ok. although I believe the margaritas are not made from fresh ingredients$LABEL$4
love this place$LABEL$4
Service gets 5 stars$LABEL$3
Went here with my Girlfriend and let me tell you that first off the Customer Service was GREAT ! I mean they was on point.... The food was Great also and I highly recommend.$LABEL$5
Been here a few times. But nothing about it is wow to me. The food is ok$LABEL$3
Torn between 3-4 stars$LABEL$4
I should've just gone to Taco Bell or Monterrey. After hearing rave reviews from Mexican$LABEL$1
Food was only ok here. Wasn't what I was used to like back home in California. A good thing about this place is that they give you good size portions for a good price. They have a good happy hour here as well for margaritas and beers. The place is comfortable with dinning availability upstairs and downstairs.  Again the food was quality was average. If you are looking for a place to satisfy your hunger then this is your place.$LABEL$3
The service was good but I got the 'pollo poblano' entree and it was so not appetizing. The rice and bean stuff was fine but ugh I am never getting that again. They gave us some chips and salsa. The salsa was too liquidy. It sort of seems like as thought they added much more water into it. The dessert thing that they just gave us was interesting. So technically got an appetizer an dessert for free and they give you more so that's nice$LABEL$3
The food was pretty good$LABEL$2
Some friends and I were staying at the Hilton Charlotte University Place just on the other side of the lake and walked over to Zapata's for dinner on a Saturday night$LABEL$2
Absolutely best Mexican in Charlotte! The service was prompt. The margarita was amazing! Best wings in Charlotte! The area are large and price is fair. Absolutely love the deck atmosphere. Must eat here frequently!$LABEL$5
Just moved from San Diego$LABEL$4
Legitimately the worst Mexican food I've had in Charlotte. Possibly the worst Mexican food I've ever had. Tacos were cold$LABEL$1
My family visited the restaurant recently. There was a dispute about the bill and the manager was called in at the request of my family. The manager was not only not nice but very unprofessional. We are hard working people. We expect good service because we pay for what we order and also tip accordingly. We have never been treated so disrespectfully. There was not even an offer of$LABEL$1
This is the only place I trust and can depend on to make a delicious-tasting smoothie.  The ingredients are fresh and the staff are SO FRIENDLY.They offer a great variety of smoothies ranging from protein shakes to \""bulk-up\"" smoothies$LABEL$5
I agree with the other folks.  I always get the orange (sunrise I think) and it is wonderful.   They also have a great mango smoothie.   IN fact$LABEL$5
Seriously?  Are these smoothies made with some prized Tibetan yak enzyme or something?  What on earth justifies a smoothie costing 8.99???Even the smoothies that had nothing \""special\"" about them except a little protein powder were 6.99 or so for a medium.It's frozen fruit$LABEL$2
Now I remember why I only get a smoothie once every 2 years. I can't afford them.$13 something for a medium and a small smoothie$LABEL$3
I come here frequently on my lunch break from work$LABEL$4
Being from Louisiana$LABEL$1
The other Maggie Moo's locations have closed$LABEL$1
Place is dirty.  Both bathrooms were out of order.  Young lady was very nice.  Will not go back.  Placed smelled like industrial cleaner.$LABEL$2
Decent lunch buffet.  Large selection$LABEL$3
I prefer to go at lunch since it is a buffet and I can have a little of everything (plus fresh fruit for dessert). I went once for dinner but it was more expensive and took a long time. Good Indian food and a great value for lunch.$LABEL$4
Jack-In-The-Box is the best fast food place. I made a trip from the raleigh area to charlotte  just for jack in the box and Ikea. Their food is always tasty and there is so much to choose from. They must have the biggest fast food menu ever. when i was in HS this is where we went when everyone wanted something different. they have all kinds of burgers from the 1.29 jumbo jack(1/4 pound burger with lettuce and tomato) to the sourdough jack(grilled sourdough with bacon$LABEL$3
The location itself is a little hard to get to (why is Charlotte so full of medians?).  The staff is generally pretty inattentive.  Often$LABEL$2
Food was good at this location... Morning service was the worst ever... Don't stop here if your in a rush in the morning take my word for it.$LABEL$3
My first Jack in the Box East Coast sighting!  I was thrilled to go and get my oh so favorite breakfast bowl.  That was until I arrived and the menu was completely different than what I had remembered from the California Jack in the Boxes.  If the food was more consistent with the west coast this place would be a 4 star easily.  It is very clean$LABEL$2
I really tried to like this place. A couple months ago I tried Jack in a Box for the first time because they sent me a free birthday dessert. After that$LABEL$2
Worst Italian food I have ever eaten. Think Chef Boyardee at ten times the price.$LABEL$1
Went to Ciro's for lunch and ordered the fresh mussel appetizer with the white wine sauce. It was pretty good. The muscles were small$LABEL$3
Good food$LABEL$4
I can't speak to the food$LABEL$1
Went there once for a Valentine's Day dinner. Not a big fan of their food but they do have the best Tiramisu in the world! I have yet to find something that can beat theirs. I have gone back but only for dessert. I'd give them 0 stars for their food and all 3 go to their tiramisu.$LABEL$3
I don't get up to the University area that often$LABEL$4
again$LABEL$2
A great italian dining experience.I like this place because it's upscale casual.The menu is diverse and the food is excellent.I had the grilled salmon with shrimp with linguini...goodness.The service was great.The romancing accordian player was a bit loud and annoying at times.$LABEL$4
Overall$LABEL$3
I dined at Ciro's while traveling for business in Charlotte. We were staying nearby and found the restaurant while walking around our hotel. We ordered appetizers for the table one of which included the fried calamari. While I didn't have any the table agreed it was quite salty. I ordered the gnocchi with meat sauce for my main entree. My guess is that the gnocchi was not homemade. It was good$LABEL$3
Dined here recently.  I have been here before but it has been years.  The place has been around for a while so I guess they are doing something right.  Food is decent.  No complaints there.  Service was good as well.  There are better options for Italian food but Ciro's is not a bad one.$LABEL$3
Had the worst Italian food ever.......$LABEL$1
I always get nervous when an Italian restaurant brings out less than stellar bread. But Ciros served up some great appetizers (Caprese$LABEL$3
Excellent atmosphere (accordion player in the evenings) and delicious fresh$LABEL$4
Overpriced and underwhelmed. The excellent waiter could not make up for for overcooked broccoli and sausage over mediocre quality pasta. Pity as I like to support the local businesses.$LABEL$2
There aren't that many nice restaurants around University but this one is close.  Your basic Italian fare with and accordion player.  The plastic/parchment covers over the table cloth's lets you know right away that this place isn't that high end.  They don't have a website???Don't get me wrong$LABEL$3
What do you do when you don't know the area and you have an urging for Italian without the use of a smartphone to go on Yelp? You improvise with the use of primitive 20th Century devices.  Naturally$LABEL$4
Average food$LABEL$2
Had lunch today with clients for whom this was their 1st visit.   They were not disappointed!   Over the past 20 years I have dined at Ciro's and have always been treated as a guest in an Italian home.   Yes$LABEL$5
Good but probably the most expensive Italian Restaurant I've ever been to. The food is good. But not worth the price. We have cheaper and better options like Olive Garden.$LABEL$4
I want to establish something before I review my dining experience here:It doesn't matter how hard I slam this place.  No one that works there can do ANYTHING about it.  If you stocked Chili's with the greatest waitstaff$LABEL$1
Chili's$LABEL$3
Go here often when the late night crave doesnt crave anything like taco bell or mcdonalds. The food usually comes out on-time and service is usually good. Though I did  have an experience where the server seemed to rush me and my girl because I guess she didn't think we'd tip well or something lol$LABEL$4
I had a enjoyable dinner ... Friendly staff$LABEL$4
Nick our server was very kind to us! Great service! Fun funny guy! Engaged my entire family! The girls that brought our food out was awesome as well!$LABEL$5
Pretty standard Michael's store... I did feel a bit cramped with the high shelves and narrow aisles.  The store seems to be as big as most other Michaels I've been to$LABEL$3
I like the sales (especially clearance prices) they offer but I shop at Hobby Lobby more often for a few reasons.1.  This store is usually in some state of disarray when I go.2. The aisles seem a bit narrow and are tall and it feels a bit claustrophobic.3. There is a manager who sometimes works the cash register who is RUDE to customers. She doesn't greet you$LABEL$2
If you need art & and crafts stuff this is a solid bet... Unless you need a lot of arts & crafts stuff. They have a wide variety of things but they don't stock a large quantity of any of them. Need 2 or 3 photo frames on the cheap? You are set. Need 6 boxes of DIY orange floral wedding invitations? You may be SOL$LABEL$3
I love Michaels! It is hard not to come out with nothing$LABEL$4
Of the Michaels in Charlotte this one is probably the one I like the least.  The store always looks terrible$LABEL$1
Bojangles is the South-East's most celebrated fast-food joint$LABEL$3
I miss Charlotte$LABEL$4
When I first moved to Charlotte a few years ago$LABEL$5
The concept of a drive through oven chicken for breakfast establishment was almost a complete culture shock for me.  Who puts chicken tenders in the oven and roasts them up for breakfast?  It's Bojangles$LABEL$4
I really didn't care for the breakfast steak biscuits.  The meat patty was coated and then deep fried.  It was impossible to tell what type of meat it was.  Eating it between the biscuits....it was like oil on oil.  The biscuit itself was ok.  But I would not go there for breakfast.$LABEL$2
This was very much like the bar and grills most college students frequent during their \""careers\"".  I liked the atmosphere$LABEL$3
We went on a Friday night to start our night.We were carded twice and they wanted to hold a credit card through our dinner!  The waitress said that was restaurant policy.  I am in my mid-30s and am way past the \""dine and dash age\"".The menu has changed dramatically since the last time we were hear.  The food selection is basically wings$LABEL$1
I'll keep this one short - DO NOT GO HERE! We waited about 20 mins to get a beer and then another 1/2 hr to get our check. Asked a couple other waitresses to get our waitress$LABEL$1
This Stool Pigeons has gone put at this location. Just wanted you to know so you wouldn't make the trip & be disappointed when you got here & saw the vacant space. Try Hickory Tavern right around the corner on Mallard Lake in The Arbors shopping center near the Trader Joes. Excellent!$LABEL$1
closed$LABEL$1
I believe this location has closed and should be removed as a listing$LABEL$1
This is a great facility. It's affordable$LABEL$4
Even though all their good is deep fried and artery clogging$LABEL$4
Always on the look out for a good Gyro! So I found this place on yelp and it was right down the street from the office in Charlotte. Huge place$LABEL$3
Great.  Never would have expected greek gyros driving by the place.We had great service$LABEL$4
Was introduced to this greek fast food chain by my coworker. It reminded me a lot of California's Daphnes chain. Was overwhelmed by their extensive menu$LABEL$3
The food was good and the waitress was nice. But this restaurant was not clean. We were the first and only people in the restaurant on a Saturday morning and the tables were nasty. The floors had trash all over them. There was dust around the windows and possible old ketchup. I won't come back to this location. The one on east blvd is much cleaner.$LABEL$2
Food is it great it's Showmars at least they can't screw that up.  Service is poor especially for pick up orders.  If you call ahead they will put you on hold until you drive to the restaurant.   Never had a problem calling in orders at any other Showmars.$LABEL$1
Make sure you're ready for NASCAR! This Hotel is as close as you may want to be from The Charlotte Motor Speedway. Get your Motor running. The staff and management are on a roll.$LABEL$4
Okay$LABEL$1
Do not stay here. Awful. As though it's not shabby enough with the slowest \""service\"" in the daytime$LABEL$1
Hair on the sheets$LABEL$2
do not spend your hard earned money here unless you want lousy repairs made$LABEL$1
Dealing with the Service Advisor at this dealership is useless. They make promises and don't keep them! Volvo want to be a luxury car$LABEL$1
3 time repeat customer here and zero complaints!  We own 3 volvos currently and have always had an excellent experience.  The sales department has always been very fair$LABEL$5
After being nickle and dimed about our trade-in to the point were we were about to walk out the door$LABEL$1
I was hoping the previous reviewer had merely had a bad stay and/or the property had updated since then$LABEL$2
really wished we would have read the reviews before staying here. We came to Charlotte for a three day convention and this hotel was conveniently located to the convention center. The only good thing I will say about our stay was that the first person we dealt with was very pleasant. We booked a room with two queen bed because we had friends staying with us for one night. The room we got had a king size bed and a gross looking pull out couch. There other rooms we supposedly booked so we had to deal with it. The room itself was very hot and we had to call maintenance to come look at the HVAC. When he came he had to go in the ceiling and switch the unit from heat to ac because the units were the same units they installed in the 80's and you have to manually switch from heat to cool. He let us now that the room would more than likely get cold in the evening because the temp that night was supposed to get down in the 40's but he would gladly come back. It did indeed get cold. The beds where not as bad as in the other reviews but if two people sat on the edge of the bed then the whole bed actually flipped up and put you on the floor. The floors by the way really need to be steam cleaned. I walked around in my socks and they were brown after just a few minutes. Very nasty. They give you three bath towels and have signs up that ask you to reuse your towels. That is fine but with four people we requested more towels and additional bedding for the pull out bed. After an hour a gentleman finally brought up just sheets. They were hot which made it seemed like they were washed when we called. A large hotel does not have sheets clean and ready to go? I called again to get towels but no one came. It was late so we just gave up. In the morning I just went and got them myself. We barely slept at all the whole time because the walls are paper thin and all we heard all night was sirens which sound like they are right outside your window. The whole time I stayed there I thought I was getting sick because I was stuffed up and sneezing. Did not start until the evening we checked in. On the day of check out I happened to glance up at the vent close to the ceiling and was absolutely horrified to see black mold growing on the bathroom wall. I took a paper towel to see if it was just dust but it was not. I informed the front desk but they just insisted it could not possibly be mold. Not one person even offered to go look. I will be reporting this hotel. In summation.... AVOID THIS PLACE AT ALL COSTS!!!!$LABEL$1
Avoid this place at all costs.  Horrifically uncomfortable mattress?  Check. Paper thin walls and a creaky floor/ceiling that sounds like others are IN your room?  Check.  Gangs if bikers partying outside your door and yet miraculously - and loudly - coming to blows in the morning?  Check.  By all that is holy$LABEL$1
Pretty happy with this place. Stayed here a week on business. Clean$LABEL$4
This was a nice place to stay. It's in an area that can be quite noisy sometimes$LABEL$4
Kind of a dingy version of the Walgreen's chain of drug stores.  I'm not sure how long it's been there but it seems like it has not aged well no matter how long it's been.Getting to the place is a challenge in this strip mall at the corner of Harris and Tryon but at least once you're there$LABEL$2
For the location that it is in$LABEL$3
Starbucks is basically the same everywhere$LABEL$3
OK$LABEL$3
The location is right on... across the street from UNCC and next store to Brueggers$LABEL$4
Great coffee and always great service. Drive thru is always fast. Very courteous and welcoming. They also offer wifi with power outlet tables. Never an issue for using your mobile device.$LABEL$5
The only reason I gave this Starbucks 2 stars as opposed to 1 is because they have a drivethru.I liked this Starbucks before they moved to the new location.  The old location would usually be moderately busy. But not like it is now.  Every time I visit this Starbucks$LABEL$2
Busy drive thru$LABEL$4
I love Starbucks$LABEL$3
Ridiculous. Had to wait 15 minutes for a latte with 8 people working there. Avoid at all costs.$LABEL$1
Good sandwiches$LABEL$3
There's a wide variety of sandwiches to choose from.  The chunky chicken melt kind of tastes like Thanksgiving$LABEL$3
Ninety's is cool and sweet$LABEL$3
Good selection of sandwiches.  The ice cream looked great but I didn't try it.Husband and I both had the BLT which was good.  Nice crisp bacon on some kind of toasted egg bread.All very reasonable priced.The only reason for the two stars is that we both had some tummy issues about an hour or so later and that was the last thing we ate.  If it wasn't for that I would give another star.I could be encouraged to give this place another go though and hope that it's a one off just because the food tasted so good.$LABEL$2
I enjoyed the strawberry cheesecake ice cream today from Ninety's Ice Cream & Sandwiches.  A co-worker was kind enogh to bring me a surprise flavor.  I had other opportunities to taste this flavor but passed them up.  You see$LABEL$4
Stayed on 8 floor$LABEL$1
My boyfriend and I booked a room on the executive floor for new years. We got here right at check out time and we were told it would be another 20 minutes before the room was ready....an hour later$LABEL$2
my sister got married here. the rooms were pretty decent$LABEL$3
The best part of this hotel is the Boardwalk area behind it.  In the Boardwalk$LABEL$3
Hotel rooms were average$LABEL$2
I had my family reunion here recently and was very pleased with the hotel. The banquet staff as well as the sales and catering staff were very helpful and my family reunion was a success. The hotel was extremely busy that weekend so I was very surprised that they were able to a meet our specific request. I did not stay in a room$LABEL$5
Currently staying here.$LABEL$3
Look$LABEL$2
Qdoba was kind of an after thought for me.  With Salsaritas and now Chipolte near by$LABEL$4
I had a vegetarian bagel here this morning: Hummus and veggies. It was good. Not much to be said for bagels$LABEL$4
I came into a wealth of free bagel & cream cheese bagel coupons$LABEL$2
I Have nothing but lovely things to say about Bruegger's and the team of people that work at my 'go to bagel shop'. The bagels are fresh and they usually have hot bagels right out of the oven and a wide variety to choose from. I usually don't stray away from my personal favorite everything bagel with an odd combination of two cream cheeses.The light garden veggie and lox cream cheese are both delish. If you're looking for something different you  try the jalapeno cream cheese. Everyone from Mary who usually rings me up to the guys who make the bagels.I like the different types of bagels and spreads. The place is always clean and there are a few tables and booths. Whenever I'm craving a carb-filled breakfast on the run I grab a bagel and my day starts off well!  $2.50 for a cream cheese bagel$LABEL$4
I have been coming to this location for years and the EVERYTIME it has been amazing. The people are always amazing and friendly.The people that work at this location are truly amazing and for that I am thankful. Always there to help you if you have questions about the process I bought the sausage - egg and cheese on a toasted plain bagel (definitely suggest)and their orange juice...refreshingBeing from New York$LABEL$5
Excellent customer service$LABEL$3
The last two times we've had to pick up prescriptions$LABEL$1
CVS' Minute Clinic should be renamed. I have found it to be significantly less convenient than making an appointment with my doctor. Due to my employer's requirement to get a wellness screening for insurance purposes$LABEL$1
Hickory Grove is the church where I vote and where my daughter plays soccer. My church$LABEL$5
Usual Hampton Inn.   Nice thing about this area is that there's  a lot of food choices all around it.  Get out your trusty GPS or Yelp to find them.I'll say the most annoying part is when housekeeping raps on the door around 8-8:30 or so.   Totally annoying especially when you have the DND tag out.  It could be for the door next door$LABEL$3
Nice and quiet hotel off the main road a lot of people miss if they not paying attention. Very clean and nice staff.$LABEL$5
We reserved a double but there weren't any doubles available when we arrived. So instead they just put a roll-a-way bed into the room. Drinking water from the faucet was also warm. On the other hand staff were nice. Wouldn't recommend this hotel unless everything else is booked since there are much nicer hotels closer to Charlotte in the same price range.$LABEL$2
I love Hampton hotels more than anything but this was a terrible experience.  Surly staff that was never at the desk. If you called out hello$LABEL$1
A fairly fun mini golf-course$LABEL$3
Sucks that Charlotte only has one mini golf course$LABEL$3
Well kept secret in University City. Took the kids for a day out. Very affordable prices. $5 for each game per person. 25 cents for the video games. Throwback video games (Pac-Man$LABEL$5
We decided come here since it was next to the mall. The place was not even that busy. The food was okay. But the service was bad. We sat there for about 20 mins until our waitress came by our table. After taking our orders she came back with the drinks. By the time we got the food the order was wrong and the waitress was no where to be found. When we ask someone if they can find our waitress another 15 minutes went by. At that time my aunt decided she's going to eat it anyways since it took forever. Then we over heard the table next to us asked her about their food. She told them she forgot to put in their order. Next time we are going else where.$LABEL$2
This place is horrible and has crappy service. They try and get over on large groups with a service charge that is 2x higher than the normal 18% tip for 8 or more guests....$LABEL$1
It's a TGIF$LABEL$2
Had lunch here the other day...  I'm still skeptical about a place like this doing asian food as I spied a  Hibachi Steak and Chicken option on the menu$LABEL$3
Food is great I can't say much for the service and the hostess who upon arriving welcomed us with a \""what!\$LABEL$1
Good food. Good service. Loud people. It was Sunday Night football in the bar area. The restaurant was not that busy and our waitress mostly stayed at the table next to us talking with another customer.$LABEL$3
First off let me say this TGIF is gonna get the brunt of a couple of other TGIF visits I've had around the Charlotte area. I'd say i've had a couple of other visits to TGIF's in Charlotte and I don't recall them being a good experience. I kinda forgot that until we headed there on a whim and right away i remembered$LABEL$1
I went to this TGI Friday's on a Friday night$LABEL$1
The only reason I went here was for a book club meeting.  I've been here several times and the food is very sub-par.  Didn't much like the steak$LABEL$2
I sincerly love Fridays$LABEL$3
Went in after church service (on Easter) and got seated pretty quickly! Not only that but the waitress was very helpful in sharing some of her favorite dishes (i like doing this to see how much they know about the food they serve!). I got the 8oz stake which I wanted MORE of (it was soooo good) with a side of Stake Fries. The wife loved her shrimp & ribs combo plate (which I of course \""tasted\"" as well) and it was very good. The shrimp had a tasteful seasoning to it that when they breaded it$LABEL$3
Had a party of 18 this past monday after my friends child graduated from h.sSo after we was seated ( in 5 tables instead of putting any together$LABEL$1
If you are looking for a bar to go to and just want to have appetizers$LABEL$5
Poor service! Manager has a bad attitude because they messed up my order and I called him out! Basically$LABEL$1
Meal was pretty average but would not go on a Friday night again. Very questionable patrons lots of leather tattoos and women that were overweight with tight clothes can you say cheap hooker!$LABEL$1
This place has been going down hill for awhile which is a shame as I do love the JD menu.  I think we have reached full hood status here.$LABEL$2
The worst I have had on the road. I stood at the entrance way for 3-4 min$LABEL$1
I don't like the restaurant portion of this TGI Fridays so I always order to go at the bar (live right across the street).  I always order the same salad but tonight I found a large kinky pubic like hair in it.  Absolutely disgusting!!!$LABEL$1
Had the absolute worst dinner experience tonight at TGI Fridays on Harris Blvd. Bottom line- the manager would not remove a charge from our bill for food they told us was at a discount AND wouldn't remove a charge for food we did NOT get. He also told me that customers were liars and he wouldn't believe that one of his employees would tell us something wrong. So just FYI - if u are a customer here u might want to rethink as you are a liar! Please share so others liars are in the know. Now mind you- this manager treated me this way all over $6.00.$LABEL$1
Went here for lunch today.  Got in at 12:30 and the place was a little dead... made me a little leery$LABEL$3
my husband & i$LABEL$1
I've visited this location many times in the past and the only thing that I have to say is \""This place has really fallen off.\""One of the first things that you'll notice when you walk in on a weekend$LABEL$1
Sitting here at the car side to go spot and I called in to let them know I am here and couldn't imagine a more disrespectful person picking up the phone$LABEL$2
Very bad service. Also my girlfriend got very sick after eating here. Also notice that the chicken she had ate was undercooked. DO NOT GO TO THIS APPLEBEE's$LABEL$1
Took 30 minutes to get our drinks and still had to wait another 10 additional minutes for our waters.  When we asked for a lemon for a drink$LABEL$1
Surprising find by some good friends. This wine bar had a great patio to hang out and drink wine. They also had a pretty great selection. The selection was more randomly broad$LABEL$4
This is the gem of University City. It's laid back atmosphere hits you from the parking lot$LABEL$5
Great place for a pre-dinner or post-dinner glass of wine.  Nice relaxing patio right by the lake.  Wine and beer. A few snacks$LABEL$4
I absolutely love this little hang out. This is the best place in the area (and among my top pics in the city) for a casual date with friends. The prices are reasonable$LABEL$5
I came here with a group from the university to talk and drink wine$LABEL$2
I....am a wine snob. So having said that$LABEL$5
I met a nice young lady out there for a few beers or a bottle of Wine. We got a table on the inside.. very nice atmosphere.....However$LABEL$3
Not a bad stop for any warm night in the University area. The atmosphere is fun and relaxing. The decor has a Pier One feel and there is usually live music out on the patio. If you're in the mood to enjoy a glass or wine or beer$LABEL$3
Ok look if you have money$LABEL$2
The official hangout for my office (since we're walking distance). Nice little spot on the boardwalk with ample outdoor seating. The inside has a larger \""community room\"" with plenty of chairs and couches. The selection is smaller$LABEL$3
Always a good time. Excellent set up for any weather situation. They tend to have live music on Fridays and Saturdays. The Wine Vault sells local beers an wine ice cold available for purchase by the glass and bottle. Very knowledgeable staff and chill atmosphere. Dog and kid friendly as well.$LABEL$4
Slowest customer service in charlotte$LABEL$2
Just another cell phone store one day great service$LABEL$3
Ehhh$LABEL$3
Took 40mins (and i was next in line) for me to exchange my 2 chargers that I had 2 replace 4months ago.the guy that helped me was to busy checking out women to wait on me$LABEL$2
Some of the worst customer service we've ever encountered. We've been \""next\"" on the list for 45m. Understandable that it's a friday night$LABEL$1
Two words:  MAN SPA!  At least for me$LABEL$4
Awesome place if you like your hair looking like you are 8 years old. Disappointing.$LABEL$1
I decided to try Sports Clips this week as I am tired of receiving mediocre haircuts for $35 or more. I am now a big fan. Ashley did a great job on my hair and I am very happy with the result. On top of that she is actually happy to be working here and her positive attitude carriers over into her customer's experience. If you are tired of over paying for your haircut give this place a try.$LABEL$5
This is my local Taco bell$LABEL$4
My fellow Mexican brothers and sisters are going to lynch me$LABEL$3
I have been to this Taco Bell couple of times with my family. The staff is very friendly. Lot of veg verity is available for vegetarians.$LABEL$5
I got there just to try the new triple steak sandwich. The price was good and the staff were nice. The place is good to sit and enjoy the meal.UPDATE (8/3/14): it seems that drive-thro staff are a little different. Since I like the food$LABEL$1
The food's okay for the buffet price$LABEL$2
Went to this Shoney's for the first time with my fiance for the breakfast buffet. We first walked in the the waitress at the front seemed a little distracted$LABEL$1
Location is a little run down$LABEL$2
the food is ok. i went on a wednesday night for the breakfast buffet and the waitresses were ok- but the food was horrible. i had 3 pancakes and they were hard and the syrup was cold. one pancake i couldnt actually bite into. another thing is$LABEL$2
I was surprised this business was in existence.  I went for a meeting an wanted to order a single order of French toast.  I was told it is only available on the buffet.  Well that was a wrap for me.  I am glad our meeting is changing either way I will not be returning.$LABEL$2
Very small rooms but nice and clean. They do have good breakfast. The only complaint would be the the stink of smoking in the lobby and the floor I stayed in.$LABEL$3
This is my favorite place in charlotte$LABEL$5
When Smokey Bones first arrived here in the University area$LABEL$2
I  AM also one of those that when it opened it was pretty good for a chain...BUT$LABEL$1
I met a bunch of friends here for dinner and while the company was great$LABEL$2
Usually asking the server what is her favorite dish gets you a pretty good recommendation$LABEL$2
i agree w/the recent reviews$LABEL$1
Food was NOT good. Service was NOT good. Nothing about our experience at Smokey Bones was good. Next time we are in the area$LABEL$1
Had the opportunity to visit Smokey Bones this week. I had the rib & chicken (White Meat- they were out of dark meat) combo. It was actually pretty good. However the worst part of this dining experience was the host who was suppose to great us when we came through the door. He started off by saying \""just 2\"". As though 2 people was not enough. Well$LABEL$2
HORRIBLE.  REALLY HORRIBLE.The only reason I gave this place 1 star$LABEL$1
sadly$LABEL$1
This review is for take out only.  We had a big family gathering in the area and one of my relatives is a big fan of Smokey Bones (I had never heard of it before).  So$LABEL$3
Love the stackable 7-layered chocolate cake$LABEL$5
Came here for lunch with a work associate and we both had the Pulled pork sandwich.  Unfortunately$LABEL$1
Came here because I wanted to try something new for dinner with my folks. Since it was near school and I didn't want to drive across the city to eat$LABEL$2
This was a bad experience from the start. The hostes told me that there was a one hour wait (even though the dining room was half empty). Twenty minutes into my wait$LABEL$1
Was in town for a family reuinion and this place was right by the hotel. We had a party of 7. The service was HORRIBLE. There were only 2 other tables occupied but it took a century to get our food. Then 6 out of 7 of us had incorrect orders. Our waitress noted that they had mixed up several plates btu instead of offering to fic it assumed that we would just all trade portions of our plates to make a correct plate. UH NO! All of our baked potatoes were hard and cold. It was a mess. Then when the bill came the waitress didn't even acknowledge the poor service with an adjustment on the bill or even an i'm sorry.  I had to ask for the manager and explain the entire debaucle to get any attention. In the end$LABEL$1
This was the most disappointing BBQ restaurant I have ever been to! From the time I opened the menu and noticed the up selling on items like the sides$LABEL$1
Good loaction with nearby gyms and shopping (including IKEA). Free gym admission with hotel key. FItness center at hotel is a few treadmills. Whirlpool was warm (not hot)$LABEL$3
To update my first review...The second morning here I woke up with ants in my bed$LABEL$1
My stepson will be going to UNC-Charlotte in the fall so we will become familiar with this area around the University.I'm a frequent traveler and used a combo of Hilton points and $$ for two nights.  It was OK.  The rooms were clean but the Homewood's I have stayed in before were newer and better appointed than this one. But$LABEL$3
It wasn't the best but it wasn't the worst. I recommend this place for one or two night stays. Rooms were big and nice but not the cleanest. Had to call maintenance because shower was not working.Breakfast 7-10 was nice but crowded. A lot of people$LABEL$2
2.5 stars.The room was fine$LABEL$3
I have enjoyed my stay very much. The complimentary breakfast was also very delicious. My room was clean and comfortable. My only complaint was the amount of TV channels offered$LABEL$4
If I was just rating this property on the staff it would easily earn five stars.  They were courteous$LABEL$3
I travel a lot for work and this hotel has the nicest staff of any hotel I've ever stayed in! Very thoughtful and respectful people working here. Dinners are complimentary to hotels guests Monday - Thursday. All homemade$LABEL$5
Everything about this place screams a budget hotel$LABEL$2
I have stayed here on a number of occassions while working nearby. Don't let the affordable pricing fool you$LABEL$5
I love love love me some Jersey Mikes! There is one sub in particular that I always get... THE ITALIAN! Now I dont like provolone and I always ask for pepper jack cheese instead$LABEL$3
This location always slacks on meats and cheeses.. This has happened the last 4 out of 5 times I visited this location. The deli items are sliced extremely thin$LABEL$1
I can first start this off with Subway gives you more for you money but the subs here are sooo good! The peper relish is awesome. Sometimes there are way too many people in line but you know you can't say that's bad. I guess the long line reflects how good the food is! Make it less pricey and I would come here more often.$LABEL$3
Jersey Mike's brings back some good memories for me when I would visit New Jersey and order the Italian subs from the delis around Hoboken$LABEL$4
A Tale of Two Franchisee's. I ate at the 7th Street location today & had an incredibly pleasant experience. However$LABEL$1
What a terrific experience for a really crappy situation.  I bought a used car yesterday and the A/C was working fine.  Today I take it for a ride (about 15 minutes) and hot air is blowing out.  I bring it to this Meineke and...bad news.  The compressor is not coming on which is a $500 repair.  Josh$LABEL$5
I have brought my car here more times than I can count.  I will not be bringing it back any time soon.  My shocks were broken in the back of my car.  They told me they needed to be replaced and they had the parts in stock.  They were 350 a side and the labor would be about another 300 so it came out to about 1$LABEL$1
I  schedule my appointment online for the morning of my 1$LABEL$1
Horrible place$LABEL$1
Is it sad that one of the fantasies I harbor closest to my heart is to be on NPR someday? I LOVE NPR$LABEL$5
Capable NPR outpost. If the tape deck isn't on en mi carro$LABEL$3
This hotel has the worst customer service that I have ever seen. They were rude and the room wasn't clean. They had several homeless people hanging out in the lobby.$LABEL$1
This place is a nightmare. The price is appealing but not worth it. The room I was given has water damage in the ceiling near the window. The light fixtures were hanging out of the ceiling and were surrounded by mold. And the door would not lock. I asked for a refund and left immediately.$LABEL$1
Do NOT stay here! The rooms are extremely cramped! Absolutely zero walking space! The bed was very uncomfortable! The iron in our room didn't work so when we called to the front desk to ask for another the lady was very rude about it and asked if we could bring the broken iron down to her. The only thing about it was that the iron was locked on to the ironing board with a cable making it impossible for me to remove it. When I informed the lady of the secondary problem she became very annoyed with me and asked me to come down and just pick up a different iron. Also$LABEL$1
We went to Nakato for our office holiday party luncheon.  I was first surprised by the grand entrance and then by the incredibly high ceilings and the vast amount of seating.  This place can accommodate a lot of people and not make you feel claustrophobic.  It also felt cleaner than the other Japanese steakhouse in the University area (read: Kabuto).  It probably helped that it didn't have that strip mall feeling$LABEL$4
Good average Japanese steakhouse for hibachi but this isn't Benihana...at all.I went to this location after seeing all of the reviews on yelp$LABEL$3
It's ok. A bit pricey for what you get. Chef hardly spoke.$LABEL$3
Great early bird special. Only till 6 pm. HIBACHI style. Steak$LABEL$4
Early bird special Sun thru Thurs from 5pm till 6pm$LABEL$5
We stopped here last week to try the sushi. Nice atmosphere and the staff was friendly. We ordered a special of the day roll that we cant remember the name of and also a rock-n-roll. The rolls were fresh and good. An average place for sushi. We rate it A-Ok...$LABEL$3
Lets just say... This place knows how to cut costs! I know that the economy has been hard on everyone$LABEL$2
I enjoyed our meal here. I'm a big fan of the teppanyaki experience$LABEL$3
The early bird special is the way to go.. The wife ordered the veggie dinner as well.. Despite earlier post i read it was plenty!! Of food.. The waitress was top notch and the decor is one of the nicest ive observed.. Only reason its not a 5 star is our bill was still 40 for two of us with drinks$LABEL$4
The place looks nice and the waitresses/chef are very nice. However$LABEL$2
I have to say overall I am not very exited about this place. The ambient is not so bad$LABEL$2
I was very impressed with Nakato. We went on a Friday night$LABEL$5
A Benihana like restaurant near our hotel and where we dined for a team dinner on a week night. They do not seat you until your entire party is here$LABEL$4
I've been eating Sushi for 23 years and they serve the worst sushi I've ever had!!!!! The service was bad as well! The Sushi was served very fast because no one was ordering it!! I wish someone told me it would be the biggest waste of 120.00 I've ever spent!!! I'll never return!$LABEL$1
Steak was good. Chicken was chewy. Service was great. Price not bad. I've had much better for the price.$LABEL$3
This place used to be good. Keyword used to be!  The fried rice was over done by garlic and if you love garlic you would understand why I didn't like it cause I love garlic. It was absolutely too much. Nothing else complimented it. Short ribs were horrible we didn't eat it and still was charged for it even though we told our server it wasn't good. Service was fine... But I think their hibachi isn't worth the money. The chefs can hardly entertain!!!  Anyways. Good luck on you're trip.$LABEL$2
I got take out. The sushi was edible but by the smell of it when I first took it out of the box$LABEL$2
Me and wife love this place. It is our favorite Sushi place. Love the atmoshere$LABEL$5
I've been coming here for many years now and have no complaints about the hibachi grill food. It's always fresh and good! Whenever I'm in the mood for Japanese and have approx 1 hour to enjoy my lunch (and have a healthy appetite!) I come here on my lunch break. The noodles are by far my favorite part of the meal$LABEL$4
I can't say enough about the service here. We had an issue the manager came right out apologized and gave us a free meal.. I will be back..$LABEL$5
We dined here for lunch.  It was not a busy$LABEL$5
We sort of liked parts of Nakato$LABEL$2
I was super disappointed with my trip here.I got the filet and scallop lunch which ended up costing about $20+ dollars. The waitress didn't remember my friend wanted shrimp AND chicken... Also didn't remember my other friend wanted steak. Two of us said we didn't want noodles so she didn't give us noodles or veggies...my steak was cooked well done not med rare as I ordered. My scallops were extremely overcooked. I had to go to bathroom and spit it out it was so hard. Not worth the money. There are cheaper options that taste way better (ie Toyama)$LABEL$2
I mean really$LABEL$4
Maybe I came on a bad night? Drive thru was pretty quick and I received friendly service. I ordered a meal and a milkshake and was told I would need to pull up a little to wait on my milkshake. I begin to munch on my fries and they were lukewarm. The milk shake was taking long so I begin eating my room temp nuggets. I'm not the type of person to send back food if I don't find if hot enough so I suck it up and eat it and wait for my shake. About 7minutes later I send the boyfriend in to get my milkshake and they told him that they thought we drove off so it was just sitting there and they didn't even remake it. Of course it was milky and melted. I've given up on most fast food places in the University Area because of awful service and quality and it looks Chick Fil A will be added to the list.$LABEL$2
My first day back enjoying this restaurant     now they have decided to remove themselves from the intimate relationships of Americans.The store was clean$LABEL$4
This place was too hype for me. I went in thinking I can get a fried chicken meal. But only to find they serve chicken sandwich and chicken nuggets.We got the spicy chicken sandwich with fries. It was delicious but curious to what had happened to the lettuce and tomato and a beat up bun. The meat was delicious and a pickle to add a kick to the sandwich. But nothing that I will crave and order again.The fries was quite amazing and cut into waffles shape. It wasn't nothing special but the waffle shape added volume and crunch.Would I come back...I don't think so. But for those who wants to try. The service in this location is top notch and very kind and accommodating. The place is clean and well kept$LABEL$3
While the Sam's in Matthews holds a special place for us because of Pakman$LABEL$3
Being that this is the closest club to my location$LABEL$3
Sams club... I have to say they won me over with a free membership$LABEL$3
Horrible management Drew (night manager) was very unprofessional with a refund I needed. After spending over 10$LABEL$1
We stayed here after a long flight back from Aruba and had wanted a nicer hotel to stay at.We chose the Drury due to the reviews we saw about the 'added' perks. The popcorn/soda and movies they show in the evenings as well as 'happy hour' with free drinks & food. We came too late to enjoy some of those perks but it was a nice stay overall. The rooms were decent with free wifi.The breakfast was above average and was very crowded. There was a huge line (unsure if we had a few groups staying there or what).Would recommend.$LABEL$5
I have mixed views about my stay here although overall it was good !! The hotel is old school$LABEL$4
The buffet is of a good size$LABEL$1
Not bad but not the best.We've eaten here twice. The first time was so-so$LABEL$2
I like Lotus quite a bit$LABEL$4
The epitome of the Americanized Chinese buffet. As much fried American food as there is Chinese. Sushi is all surimi. Everything tastes the same$LABEL$2
Literally the worst Chinese buffet I have ever been to. I'm shocked this place has 3 stars. My husband enjoys buffets so I allowed him to drag me here$LABEL$1
Not the worst Chinese I've had$LABEL$2
Greasy unappetizing fried food. Low quality ingredients. Pretty much tastes all the same.Never again.$LABEL$2
Since there are more options in the area Lotus has really took the last place to go. The buffet area look very small compared to the other Chinese buffets. The pricing is a bit high. I would definitely choose a different buffet overall. The food is ok$LABEL$2
best chinese food! people that work here are so nice!$LABEL$5
Ate here today with my ol' lady$LABEL$3
I was looking for a Chinese food cater for a small group party. Lotus catered a couple of friends' wedding so I called them to give it a try$LABEL$5
Oh Kohls$LABEL$5
I'm a huge fan of Kohls and moving to the Charlotte area has pushed me to find a different Kohls than the one I always went to an hour away. And here it goes$LABEL$1
I received a PJ set as a gift from my Mom for Christmas. She paid $19.20 for the top and $19.20 for the pants which = $38.40 total.  Unfortunately$LABEL$1
Te coastal credit union doesn't exist anymore$LABEL$3
Stopped in to catch some Monday Night Football action here after a nice dinner.  Cowboys versus the Giants... man the crowd was insane.  Since the place was busy our waitress was running around like crazy... but didn't seem like she was doing anything.  It took forever for her to get the bill after my buddy and I each had a beer.  Luckily we both had cash on us so we just left it on the table.Service aside$LABEL$3
This is a perfectly awesome sports bar.You can go there for any big game for any sport$LABEL$5
Great food$LABEL$5
I'm a huge fan of this place.  It's an actual sports bar$LABEL$5
Stopped in Sunday after the recommendation of a friend.  It was blazing hot outside and the A/C in my house wasn't keeping up with it$LABEL$4
Had the calzone Saturday. REALLY good. As usual$LABEL$4
Ok$LABEL$3
This is a great spot for local UNCC students or a nice place to go and hang out with friends or your significant other.  It is a great place to watch whatever game you want because they have tons of TVs as well as the largest projection TV I have seen thus far in Charlotte.  I have only tried the wings and the pizza and they are definitely on point.  The pizza is oven baked$LABEL$4
Going to Picasso's was a real experience. When we walked in...we just walked in. No hostes what so ever. Everyone's been to a sports bar before$LABEL$4
Went to check out a game with some friends and was horrified at our service.One of our party received a cold pizza roll and brought it to our server's attention. How tacky can one be in deciding to stick one's finger in a patron's food and declare the patron wrong?Unbelievable. And then the manager decided to get in on the action. He made a special trip to our table to declare the server was correct in her statement and her action because she was requested to stick her finger in the food in question.Really?If this is any indication of how customers are treated at Picasso's$LABEL$1
Came here on a random Wednesday night$LABEL$3
Great place to watch a game or just grab a good bite to eat. The prices are reasonable and the amount of food you get for the price is pretty good. I would suggest the wings and the cheese fries...the fries were rather awesome.$LABEL$4
It's really a place to watch sports have drinks. That's it didn't like the food there. It's probably cause its just meant for sports and drinks. Since I'm not a fan of either its definitely the wrong place for me. But for those who like drinks and sports this would be your spot!$LABEL$2
I'm new to the area and was lucky enough to have this bar across the street from my long stay at the Marriott. Now that I have moved I still come back because the service is outstanding and the pizza is wonderful. If you are looking for a sports bar$LABEL$5
They've got plenty of screens and channels to get whatever event you wanna watch. Food is solid pub grub and they're quick about it. Friendly staff$LABEL$4
I went to Picasso yesterday as a single lady just to get a drink & some food. The service is terrible! This is my second time going. Every time I go the lady behind the bar looks like her dog just died. It took forever for them to come to me. I didn't get one smile from either bartender. The roll I had was good. But I can find good food elsewhere I prefer good service!$LABEL$1
Great food$LABEL$4
This place has the best chicken wings in town. Hands down. Also the homemade potato chips are a must for when you come to watch whatever game you want. One of the waitresses$LABEL$5
Safe place to have dinner.  Quality of food was up to their normal standard.  As usual the noise was not conducive for good conversation.  But the food was a welcome comfort after being on the road all week.$LABEL$3
This place has been around for year's$LABEL$3
We have been staying very near to this place for the past 5 months... How many times we thought of trying this one out.. Finally we did :) .. Food was pretty good.. Chicken parm was awesome ( highly recommended )... However there were very few servers around and the service was'nt great either.. Food was pretty good though.. I am a fan of this place :)$LABEL$4
The service was great but the food was not. All the pasta for our party was undercooked; there were 14 of us. Other customers also were returning meals. The manager told us they were using a new pasta and had to \""learn to cook it\"". She did make an adjustment on our bill to make up for the bad meals.$LABEL$2
Good food.  Unpleasant hostess.  I like that.they have lite calorie options.$LABEL$3
Stay Away!I had two items: a Caesar salad$LABEL$1
Went with a large group of 8 for a business dinner.  The service was a bit lacking - our waiter seemed to disappear at times and prolonged the dinner.  It was fine because we had a lot to discuss$LABEL$3
All of the pasta dishes from here were good. My wife love the Penne Rustica and I loved the Stuffed Mushrooms and the Eggplant Parmesan and our son the the Mac and Cheese$LABEL$4
Got together with a few former coworkers Saturday night early (5:00-ish) to catch up & have an early Christmas celebration.  Since it just so happened none of us had been to MG in a while$LABEL$2
We have dined at this chain for over 20 years. It was one of our favorites. Well bubba$LABEL$1
We selected this restaurant because we had a gift card to use for our date night and on a Friday$LABEL$2
Nice ambiance but pasta was dry and cold$LABEL$2
This place is only getting 2 stars as they comped my salad$LABEL$2
Been to this place last Friday for dinner. At first we were served with bread and olive oil. I ordered$LABEL$3
We have always loved Macaroni Grill in Winston and Greensboro.  We were visiting friends in Charlotte and chose Macaroni Grill to meet.  The restaurant was practically empty on a Sunday afternoon when we met.  The appetizers were great (baked prosciutto and mozzarella; zucchini fritti) but the service was mostly non-existent.  I was surprised  because the server didn't have a lot of distractions to consider (very few other customers).  The fettuccini alfredo was very dry (they forgot one order and rushed to make it).  The chicken under a brick was awesome and probably the only reason I gave 2 stars above.  Everything else (except the friends) was disappointing.$LABEL$2
I have eaten here a dozen or so times in the past decade$LABEL$4
This restaurant is a huge surprise$LABEL$4
I try to stay away from the chain joints because I always find myself writing mediocre reviews...and I hate writing mediocre reviews.  This was a work lunch so I had to attend.  Well$LABEL$2
Have been going here for a while. I loved what they did to their menu last year$LABEL$2
o sole mio.. o sole mio... I forgot what I ate$LABEL$1
It's a Macaroni Grill... not much to say about this... if you have gone to one$LABEL$2
I have to admit$LABEL$3
The portions! So big!!! Enough for 2 people. The bread! Freshly baked and warm... and moist and yummy! You need to ask for it if it doesn't come right away.The apps are good. My favorite was the melted cheese... fuendo I think it was called. It was addicting!  Melted mozzarella cheese mixed in with other cheese. With bread to spread the cheese on. And they give you a lot of cheese... melted stringy goodness...The main courses were huge! I had the chicken and mushroom cannelloni.  Very good. Little salty$LABEL$3
Terrible service. Had to ask for refills. Waitress disappeared. Had to ask someone to find her. Food quality has diminished from what it was. Thought I would try them again. Not coming back. What a shame. It used to be a great restaurant.$LABEL$1
Thought the staff was incredibly rude. With out anyone else in the restaurant$LABEL$1
The food sucked!  The Calimari was disgusting and my canniloni tasted like it came out of a frozen box.  My water was good. Servers$LABEL$1
Good place with a lot of options for lunch.  You can even customize your sandwich here if you aren't feeling up to their many sandwich options.I think all McAlister's feel a bit the same... you get \""herded\"" to the back of the location to a bank of registers to order.  The staff at most of these locations are pretty friendly and helpful... sometimes you feel a little rushed if the line is starting to build and they try to get you through.  You are given a number to place on the table and the bring out the food to you nice a hot/fresh.This location offers free wi-fi but I haven't brought my computer to test it out yet.  I've seen people working or meeting with laptops here.The thing I HATE about this location in the university area is the parking lot.  It is impossible to get in and out easily and the spaces are all for compact cars$LABEL$3
McAlisters deli is$LABEL$3
Not impressed at all$LABEL$1
Food was meh$LABEL$2
Me & some friends came here for lunch but an hour pass by & we never received our food... we end up leaving because our lunch time was over... never coming back to this restaurant$LABEL$1
This motel was one of my only options as it was right off of the highway and allowed dogs. This was the week of the monster Nov storm that hit the east coast and I was exhausted from driving slow in the rain.  It was late and not being a NC native$LABEL$2
This is an email I received from what seems to be the Manager.  Very rude.  He doesn't seem to understand that when there is a shooting and lots of other crime in or near his motel$LABEL$1
My wife and I stayed here last year around July. We searched around to find a nice hotel for a few nights that would fit our budget. When we got to the hotel$LABEL$1
Not clean$LABEL$1
Do not trust this days in. Note on wall saying no refund after 15 mins but out of site so you don't see and takes that long to drive around to room walk up stairs and see the state of the room. No refund given. Rude and unprofessional. They take your money.  You don't get to see the room. I asked for non smoking. All I got was a smoking room. Went back and changed and got another smokers room. Came back and got shown a sign on the wall to the sideOUT OF SITE TILL THEY SHOW YOU NO REFUND AFTER 15 mins.  Do not trust this days in. They stole my money. The room is not worth 58 bucks. It's not worth 30 bucks. Ramada hotel Charlotte airport and conference center and for 10 bucks more it's like going from a dumpster to a royal palace. Take my word. Don't waste your time or money.  And if you don't believing me ask if you can see a room before paying. And I bet they will refuse cause the photos look nothing like the rooms.  Trust and go elsewhere. I lost money. No refund and I have to wait till the money hits my bank and then I get it back but as I am leaving the USA. Well that will take time.  So don't take my word. If they don't let you see. Go else where. Why would they say 15 mins lose refund. Simple. It's that bad!!!!!!!!!! Unprofessional when owner says go to hell to a customer asking for refund!!  I won't even give it one star if I could but I have to$LABEL$1
I was in the charlotte area looking for a motel which would be a great price and be comfortable at the same time$LABEL$5
Also note they lie when you fight it with your bank.  Sadly I left the country to move back to England so communicating with the bank is so slow this company days in lied to steal money from me when I never stayed there. I actually booked with a better place that was not a **** hole of a place. Trust me. Same price by the airport and your in a luxury.  Don't trust this pace. Unfair 15 mins refund before you even see a room. Rooms are disgusting. Cheap and not worth 25 to 30 dollars including tax and that's being fair.  Owner is well full of him self and cares not about his customers. That's why they hide the 15 mins warning out of plan site. Any hotel or motel will and should let you see a room before you commit. So don't trust this place and if you want bed bugs. I can bet this place does. Sheets looked old. Be very careful. Go to better places. Check airport hotels. Same price and so much better.$LABEL$1
I give this place 5 stars. My boyfriend and I drive straight through the night to Charlotte and arrived at 9am. We were seeing a concert that night. We explained that we just needed to sleep and would be checking out by midnight. Instead if making us pay for 2 nights (which is what every other place I called wanted) they accommodated us with a smile. :) really means a lot! They even gave us a room on the third floor in the back corner where it was quieter so we could sleep. Convenient location. The room was clean$LABEL$5
I had such good luck with Sugar's (across the street)$LABEL$1
Went there for lunch Friday.  It was a pretty bad experience.  When we walked up to the hostess stand$LABEL$2
The word \""saloon \"" is pretty misleading as they only had 2 beers on tap.I can't say we experienced any meanness from the staff like previous reviewers- everyone was very nice. It was the rest of the clientele that were sketchy and terrifying.It's not a nice/fancy restaurant but it us within walking distance of the many hotels- be sure to bring your pepper spray or concealed carry!Expansive menu from Italian to Greek$LABEL$2
Although the decor could use some updating$LABEL$3
This is one of those places that you wouldn't think might be kind of questionable$LABEL$3
Best Features:Extremely nice and helpful staff. Great room layout. Worst Features:Minor problems with utilities. Some did not work until we had the staff bring batteries or make repairs.Needs instructions for dialing. phone is confusing for someone who doesn't normally use office phones from 1987.Need warning for ice maker. You have to turn it on when you enter...or there is no ice.Bottom line: A great hotel for the price that is not too far from downtown Charlotte.Side note: I've been staying here for about 3 or 4 years now. It's a great place.$LABEL$4
It was clean and comfortable. I'm giving it a 4 because I was bothered at twice by the room attendants despite having my \""Do Not Disturb\"" sign out.$LABEL$4
This hotel was a great stop on our way through North Carolina. The staff is incredibly nice and the hotel is clean and smells fresh.They have an awesome \""lending locker\"" I. The front lobby where you use board games$LABEL$5
My weekend workout spot.  This is a full service gym complete with childcare$LABEL$4
As I normally consume lots of chocolate$LABEL$4
Lousy over zealous life grds.  Won't even let you float on your back.  Lifeguards are power monger idiots here!  I was a 10 year lifeguard and they are not trained or professional.$LABEL$1
Well$LABEL$4
I've got to admit this is by far the best vet. I've ever taken my pampered pooch$LABEL$5
If Stoney Creek were a mechanics shop$LABEL$2
All right$LABEL$2
Took my boxer there for an annual exam and vaccines. The vet was nice$LABEL$1
I have been a client here for 6 years$LABEL$1
All we ask was for our dog to be groom and get one shot.   They had the dog from 8am$LABEL$2
Very unpleasant experience with this animal hospital. Our dog was having issues with his hind leg when we decided to take him in. The vet barely paid any attention to the things I was trying to tell her about the issue. Felt around on his hind leg and said \""well I don't feel arthritis$LABEL$1
$25 for a pedicure...decent price but they did not have enough staff. There were 4 of us today...waited 20 minutes to get acknowledged and only one of us ended getting a pedicure done. The rest of us gave up and left.$LABEL$2
I have been here for eyebrow waxing. My eyebrows were halfdone. I had to come home and pluck the leftout hair..$LABEL$2
I am extremely disappointed.  I have been going here since November and today was horrible. I left with 2 finger bleeding$LABEL$1
While staying at the Homewood Suites in Charlotte$LABEL$3
The guy taking our order was nice and got my order right.  It didn't take to long for the order to be complete and the price wasn't too bad.  However the wings were not anything to brag about$LABEL$3
I've given this place so many chances with their food because I wanted to give them the benefit of the doubt.. They just kept getting it wrong. The best thing on the menu would probably be the cheese fries$LABEL$1
My daughter ordered garlic parmesan boneless wings and received original tame. As this was a to go order she didn't go back to get this rectified.  Way too much money for the wrong stuff!$LABEL$2
Ordered delivery food took two hours and was cold. Wing sauce was spilled all over bag.$LABEL$1
Came here with a friend to grab a couple of items. Neat$LABEL$3
Clean grocery$LABEL$3
Pretty much your standard HT here.  This location is convenient to my place of work so I stop in every once in a while to get provisions.  It is very easy to get in$LABEL$3
Yesterday was my first time at Longhorn and I was quite surprised about how tender the steaks are for a run of the mill chain. A shame that my steak came drenched in sauce though. The chicken was just as tender - filet tender and service here is equally good. They also top the mashed potatoes with clarified butter$LABEL$3
I'll cut right to the tender$LABEL$4
This place is just ok. We went here on Saturday$LABEL$2
Eat here somewhat regularly.  Food is normally very good. Service varies between pretty good and very good. We had dinner here last night.  Good service. Most of the food was great.  Unfortunately$LABEL$4
The ribeye is my favorite steak.  I ordered the Outlaw Ribeye$LABEL$2
The general manager$LABEL$4
I've been to a few services and events here with some family$LABEL$3
Central is my home church and has been for 15 years$LABEL$5
Spirit filled church; outstanding music.  The easiest (and not anywhere close to the whole story) description would be \""Pentacostal Lite\"".  You're not going to see snakes or much in the way of speaking in tongues but if you are interested in a Church where Jesus is the center focus and worship is an active experience then this is the place for you.  Our family took a long time getting to visit here$LABEL$5
My Mother had the unfortunate experience of being there for 6 weeks in rehab. Although the place looks nice$LABEL$1
My father was in this facility for a short time (3 days).  I can not recommend this facility.  Observations:1- Staff seemed preoccupied with weekend planning and other activities outside of the workplace.  2- Below average sanitation.  3- Bathroom light was not working upon arrival and was not repaired for 24 hours.  A bit of an issue with physically challenged patients.  4- Staff did not seem competent in terms of how to operate equipment.  5- If I had not actively transferred my father$LABEL$1
Came in for a quick bite for lunch on Monday we were the only ones here and took a seat at the bar tables. We started with the Fried Mushrooms they were pretty good the ranch with them was good. I had a Hot dog with Sauerkraut and French Fries pretty good the roll was a little too much bread for me but it was ok. My sister had the Veggie Sandwich and she said it was pretty good it was really big! We also placed an order to go for our boss but that took forever it was just a grilled Chicken sandwich! So all in all it was pretty good bar food.$LABEL$3
Nice bar... kinda empty... but then again I was there on a Wednesday night.  The regulars were out and about (so the bar was full).The hostess... also our waitress was very nice and seated us.  Didn't rush us while ordering and the food came out within reason and very good!The place was nice and definitely on my list for watering holes in Matthews.  It's tucked into a strip mall so it can be hard to miss.  I can see this place being packed on the weekends with two/three nice pool tables and plenty of standing room in the dining area/bar.$LABEL$3
I seem to always get up sold whenever I go to an Autobell. The problem is$LABEL$2
Meh... I'm not that impressed. I got the \""Manager's Special\"" which was supposed to be their best package. They did a really poor job vacuuming and there were still dirty spots on my car. I pointed this out to the employee and he didn't do much to fix it. He said the vacuums couldn't get all the dirt off my mats... Really? My Dyson could. He just took a towel and swept the dirt off the seats onto the carpet... Umm thanks? For $30$LABEL$2
We went here for lunch last week. The place is very small$LABEL$2
If it was possible to give no stars.. I would. Have been here several times and am always greeted by the same drone$LABEL$1
The oil-change side is fantastic. The manager believes in superior service. But AVOID the inspection side.  Apparently they are two seperate divisions. Most of the time the inspection guy is nowhere to be found. Poor customer service also. Slow & doesn't want to be there. So$LABEL$3
Inspection slow and unprofessional. Left my car dirty and smelling of cigarettes. Should have known better based on yellow-toothed manager.$LABEL$2
More of a country style goodwill but its cool had what I need for cheap$LABEL$2
Mostly used this Goodwill location as a donation site.  My last donation experience wasn't a great one... I had packed up my clothes that either don't fit or I just don't wear anymore into a nice box.  There are some pressure strips that probably alert the staff as you drive up to the donation door so someone comes out and helps you unload your stuff.  The guy didn't really say too much... must have been a long day.  I usually don't ask for a receipt unless I donate electronics and such.I do remember taking our old family computer here back in the day.  It was pre-IBM386$LABEL$2
You never know what you'll find in here... but I found 2 like new chairs for my living room for under $50! I have also found some nice crystal glasses (including goblets$LABEL$4
i like this place a lot. it's big$LABEL$4
Ive been a member of IP for almost two years (even considering it a second home). I put a hold on my membership for the holidays and decided with Grad school that I couldnt afford the membership and really didnt have the time for it. I wrote an email using their contact us form and never heard anything back.Next thing I know almost two months later they are hitting me with a $172 charge! They did offer to reimburse one month and give me 5 days free initially. I don't think it's considered \""free\"" if I technically already paid for it. The woman who I dealt with said she didnt receieve emails and that I needed to fill out a special form. I am not sure why I was never contacted when I suddenly appeared to not be paying my membership despite the fact that I had always done so in the past- I never climbed once during this period obviously since I had thought everything was taken care of. The woman was unwilling to work with me at all. I did not want to pay for Jan (considering its the 7th) - the month literally just started at least cut me some slack there. The customer service is obviously lacking since I have brought them tons of business in the past ( signed up several friends and my cousin is on team now). They did finally agree to take away Dec/Jan fee's but I am still paying about $70 just because they apparently never received my email. Oh and I was also told not to return because I \""hung up.\"" How is that for friendly service?! It was one of the most frustrating calls Ive made in a long time. I know they have let ex-employees who were fired due to drug related activities continue to climb so I have to feel a bit offended that I am banned. I will be going to The White Water Center or outdoors for all my climbing kicks. Be careful if you sign up for a membership- and send emails via your own account so you have copies- I learned a huge lesson here.$LABEL$1
I'm new to climbing so I've not got much to compare this place to. So far I've loved the place and have had no qualms except that the music selection. Mix it up guys... Something other than classic rock$LABEL$3
i get alright service sometimes$LABEL$2
This was the first time I had Taco Bell in MONTHS!  You can imagine my excitement to try the XXL Chalupa for the first time... just went through the drive trough$LABEL$4
I give this location 2 stars$LABEL$2
we ate lunch here yesterday and everyone left happy and full!!!! it was good!!1$LABEL$4
Great pizza at a great price! We order from this place even though it's on the other side of Matthews from where we live. Sure beats Domino's or Papa John's.$LABEL$4
Good not great pizza. This is a chain store there big thing is flavored crusts which is pretty good. I go with butter!Allergy alert: Their sauce does not have garlic in it so if you know of someone who has a garlic allergy they can eat this pizza sauce without worry of garlic (make sure to check again before trying it$LABEL$3
I had a great relationship with this particular Howie's store until a couple of weeks back$LABEL$2
Stopped in here because the kids were hungry$LABEL$4
The Howie bread was excellent$LABEL$3
I've been craving breadsticks since I picked up some from Target. (Pizzahut breadsticks) (they're so good!)Anyways$LABEL$1
This place is your run of the mill Mexican resturaunt$LABEL$3
CLOSED DOWNI just love circling around a shopping on a Friday night looking for a place that no longer exists...... not!$LABEL$1
I don't want to dedicate too much time to a BK review$LABEL$2
i've gone here numerous times since my initial review$LABEL$2
Luckily I don't mind Coke....  I have been here several times and it's been... \""meh\""... but the last time I came through the drive thru and ordered a simple Medium #1 with onion rings.  I thought it was strange that the order taker did not ask what I wanted to drink$LABEL$2
It's very pitiful that I have to give a 1 star to any restaurant or business. But this place deserves it.Burger King hasn't really been good for anything$LABEL$1
Best Wok has been serving great Chinese food here for many$LABEL$4
Best Wok is my favorite Chinese place in Charlotte. A bold claim$LABEL$5
Pretty good carry out...generous portions$LABEL$4
Recently stopped in for lunch.  Had the General's chicken with the chicken wings.  At least something different from the usual lunch specials with the egg roll.   The food was fine$LABEL$3
I think my heart may break if we don't find a place that will deliver good Chinese food soon.  I wish Best Wok delivered$LABEL$4
Love this place. Not fancy but the ladies know what they are doing$LABEL$4
Juliana's is not the most glamorous place in the area$LABEL$3
Would've liked to have gone three and a half stars here but of course can't cause it's just not allowed. Good food. Family run. Good service. Not crowded. Inexpensive.$LABEL$3
***WARNING!!!!!*** THIS PLACE IS HORRIBLE!  WHY?  Here it is.  My family and I went to this place Saturday evening based on the reviews here on Yelp and other sites such as Urbanspoon.  4 of us ordered chicken Parmesan$LABEL$1
Best pizza and wings in the queen city! ! Nice place for a date or hang with friends.  Service is awesome.  I will be back for sure!$LABEL$5
I am confused. I am baffled. I am in shock. I am disappointed.  When I read the reviews I was a little surprised but I figured somehow I must have looked over this place after all these years and I was actually regretting it!  Now...not so much. I quickly realized there was a reason I grew up right around the corner yet never visited this place.  I realized there was a reason I never even stepped foot in this place on a lunch break while working at the neighboring Food Lion as a squeaky teenager with braces. Back then I thought Ragu was gourmet so I wasn't even picky but STILL knew to stay away from Juliana's  There is a reason why our Italian family of 7 never bothered ordering from here even though it was cheap and close by!  You have to realize this was before the restaurant scene really even popped off in Charlotte!! There were no options!  Uptown was downtown$LABEL$1
Our favorite pizza and a great family ownership and atmosphere.  We have a tradition on Friday night we go and pick Julianas Pizza up and the kids as well as mom and dad eat it all!  Also they have homemade coconut cream pie and brownies that are second to none!$LABEL$5
This is the most horrible dry cleaners I have ever experienced.  They completely destroyed a $200 shirt and just lost another silk blouse.  Throwing away your clothes would be easier than driving to this dry cleaner$LABEL$1
NEVER GO HERE! TAKE YOUR BISS. ELSEWHERE! THESE PEOPLE RIP YOU OFF! I just moved into the area looking for a dry cleaners. This one was close to my home but by far the worst experience i ever had. I brought my work shirts in and handed them to the woman to look at to give me a direct price. She looked at my shirts. I also had one apron$LABEL$1
I did business with this cleaners about every week for over 15 years. I recently left a custom made - $175 men's dress shirt for cleaning. The shirt is one year old but like new. Somehow$LABEL$1
Let's face it - with as many as four dogs$LABEL$3
I took my cat here this past weekend for a bath and to have her claws clipped.  I was not happy at all.  I specifically told them when I dropped off my cat that I did not want her fur trimmed at all.  When I picked her up I was told that they trimmed her sanitary area.  Trimmed...yeah right!  They shaved half of her belly.  There was absolutely no reason for that.  She was not dirty in her private areas.  Not only was she shaved but it was all crooked with tufts of hair sticking out on the sides.  I didn't see this until we got home since she was in the crate when I picked her up.  I called back to complain.  They told me to bring her in again and they would fix it.  100 degrees and back we go to the groomer.  They took her in the back and \""fixed it\"".  Then they offered me a $5.00 discount on my next visit.  It's still not right.  They straightened out the line but now the whole thing is at an angle.  It looks ridiculous.  The groomer who shaved my cat needs to have her eyes checked.  For someone who does this for a living she did a pretty pathetic job.The place is also pretty old$LABEL$1
Great service$LABEL$4
I went to Cute Nails over the weekend. It was my third nail salon that I have frequented in the Charlotte area. This place paled in comparison to the other two. It was a decent environment inside. The pedicure I got was only $25 which is a good price. As someone else mentioned$LABEL$2
Yen is Back! !  !  Gourmet Chinese at its Finest!Best Chinese in Charlotte!  Best Chinese I have had since the last time I was here!  This is another place \""55\"" introduced me to about three years ago and is one of the few places I want to eat Chinese!  Mr. 1$LABEL$5
It's a pretty standard Chinese place primarily focused on take-out customers.  It's definitely not the \""Best Chinese in Charlotte\$LABEL$2
i got a text today asking if i wanted to do lunch. When i asked where$LABEL$3
I have been going this HT every since it opened$LABEL$5
I would like to rate a little higher but I can't because of the prices. The store and staff are great$LABEL$3
Great customer service experience with Chris who works as bagger / cashier. Great attitude$LABEL$5
Free$LABEL$4
Short drive to a peaceful getaway. Pack a picnic$LABEL$5
Great place right in the city$LABEL$5
Love the nature trailsAnd the beautiful picnic areasA great place to take the family$LABEL$5
Chicken teriyaki is good. Ordered cashew chicken$LABEL$2
Simple Americanize Chinese takeout. Fast when you ordered via phone. Don't expect great customer service. I would go here when I'm seriously craving for Chinese takeout. I like their chicken egg foo young with gravy on the side$LABEL$3
Extremely Americanized Chinese food$LABEL$3
Consistently solid experience. Americanized Chinese food at a decent price. And they are open until around 11:00 during the week. It's my solid go-to spot when I need Chinese food.$LABEL$4
Stopped in with a large box to find out how much it would cost to ship it. The gal behind the counter was friendly$LABEL$3
This place is a crapshoot.....sometimes you can go through the line with no problems$LABEL$2
This location is no longer open.$LABEL$1
I had three keys cut here for a bit less than 7 bucks.  There were two men working on shoes.  I made eye contact with one$LABEL$3
So far I've had 2 repairs done here.  My favorite dress shoes finally bit the dust and I had the entire sole replaced on both shoes. The work was high quality$LABEL$5
When traveling on business$LABEL$4
Sweet tea and spicy chicken sandwich was yummy! Spicy chicken was actually spicy which was nice. Also criscut fries were seasoned appropriately.$LABEL$5
Great location great quality food that is always hot and fresh.. Generally this chain is the cleanest most sanitary you can go to soQuality is never a question here... Plus the forces always stop and eat here which i guess is another good indication$LABEL$5
So$LABEL$5
I felt compelled to give this place 5 stars because there are a bunch of \""reviewers\"" giving it lesser stars for the dumbest reason.  Sorry$LABEL$5
I stopped in randomly for lunch the other day and it was great. there was a longer line but thought it must be worth it.  the line moved pretty fast due to the guy behind the register.  he moved the line along with speed and not at the expense of the customer.  funny guy.  the burrito was perfect and delicious.  I will visit Johnny Burrito often when i buy lunch in town.$LABEL$5
I think of this place as more like Meh$LABEL$3
Felt compelled to write a quick review after having a phenomenal burrito here today. I've been going here for about three years and had some fine meals$LABEL$4
Johnny Burrito is A-Okay. Not great$LABEL$3
Not only do I love the food here$LABEL$4
The owner is there everyday$LABEL$2
I'm updating my review b/c I recieved a message from the owner. (Good Customer Serv.)its good to know owners care enough to reach out to patrons that use Yelp.I have not been back however$LABEL$3
Friendly staff. The owner is always there$LABEL$4
First of all$LABEL$3
Friendly service$LABEL$5
This place is overrated. The food is no better then the other burrito places in uptown. I guess the private ownership and legacy reputation leads people to give it more credit than it deserves. You also get lip from the owner if you want to pay credit.$LABEL$2
Best gas prices in Tega Cay.$LABEL$4
Terrible customer service.  Watch out!  I agree they are an unethical company.  I was with them for 10 years. I called to cancel my service months before the actual cancel date and the not so friendly customer service rep said I owe 90 days per an agreement back in 2002.  They dismissed my original cancel notice and said I have to pay at least 30 days more!!!  And she was doing me a favor and hung up on me!!!$LABEL$1
I inherited a Muzak account from the previous business owner.  I couldn't believe that anyone would pay over $100 a month for this crappy service.  Every time the wind would blow we would lose the connection to the dish on the roof.  $300+ service fee for some guy to drive 4 hours to fix it.  Unbelievably poor service and super expensive on top of that.   I immediately canceled the service only to to told that there was some 60 month contract of  which I or the previous owner had never seen..........I'll let my lawyer handle that one.  If you are using Muzak$LABEL$1
Please business owner$LABEL$1
I have used Muzak for 2 years and am always complimented by my customers on the music we use.  Whenever there has been a reception problem$LABEL$5
This company's contract is very frustrating to work with. I signed a 60 month (5Year) contract and in their fine print$LABEL$1
You should check out PlayNetwork.com.  Great customer service with a ton of service options that won't break the bank.$LABEL$1
I have been working with Muzak for nearly 7 years$LABEL$1
This is a great place for a hike or a trail-ride and very affordable too. I know someone who had a wedding in the barn (yep$LABEL$5
We tent camped$LABEL$5
I keep wanting to call this place Anne of Green Gables...it just fits and if you ever saw that movie or read those books you would see how the two paralell..This place was just so....GREEN!  It was so beautiful and walking past the dairy farm sealed the deal for me on the whole experience.  There are so many different trails/loops so you can just wander around for hours if you so choose.  The walking bridge$LABEL$4
Who knew Fort Mill could boast such a cute little coffee/lunch/wine spot?  I was brought here by some collegues for lunch since I was in town to visit HQ.  Not really excited about the lunch options based on my last trips$LABEL$4
Overpriced and my muffin was stale.  Not worth the $7 I spent on the muffin and coffee.  Will not go again.  Believe it is overpriced due to the area...$LABEL$2
Not much cheap take out in the area. Thank goodness it's good! The staff is friendly like mentioned in another review. Definitely worth a try.$LABEL$3
Not good at all.  I was there at 10:40$LABEL$1
One of my favorite Chinese places around.  Granted$LABEL$4
Start with the positives:  room was clean$LABEL$3
Try to come in the morning or evening. N e other time the place is packed and sometimes it's hard to get in.  If you live in Charlotte and work in this area (Carowinds Blvd. or nearby) make it a part of your stop to get the best deals on gas.  Right down the road once the state lines crosses back over into North Carolina the Shell station (on the corner of S Tryon) is at least $0.20 more.Also$LABEL$4
This Circle K is on the corner next to Carowinds and is a distributor for Shell gasoline products. It also shares a structure with Wendy's$LABEL$3
I could not use the pay at the pump feature with a credit card. I tried twice and eventually had to hang up the pump and drive away. The display screens were cracked$LABEL$1
Ordered for take-out.  Was pleasantly greeted on the phone and my order was taken down promptly.  When I showed up$LABEL$2
What is the best pizza?  New York for sure!  What is the closest you can get to that around here?  Village Pizza!  We order for delivery$LABEL$5
Had the buffet. Not many people in there tonight so the selection of pizza seemed minimal tonight. Overall - just ok pizza. Air conditioning must not have been working either.$LABEL$2
This place was taken over and remodeled recently(within the last 4 months). The new owners seem to get it. This place is great for the value. I would ignore any posts older than 4 months or so since it is not the same place.$LABEL$4
The original owner has restored our faith in real Italian food. www.villagepizzategacay.com has the whole menu just like before. Ginny Myers is back now since March 1st and doesnt skimp. come on back.$LABEL$5
Best pizza in York Co. SO glad the original owners are back. Great food$LABEL$5
They closed down for a while$LABEL$2
Great place to take anyone especially kids um and also delivery is incredible highly recommended$LABEL$5
So glad the old owners took it back over. SO MUCH BETTER. One of the better pizza buffets around town!!!$LABEL$4
I agree with another poster on the review about Village Pizza being compared to Dominos. I have to say tag lines of \""Real Italian Food\"" caught my eye and sparked my interest. unfortunately$LABEL$2
Ordered for delivery..giving the information was painful. The person on the other line had an attitude and had trouble coping the information. I don't think I could have spoken any slower. I was told 35 min. Well 35 turned into 55. That extra 20 is an eternity when you have 3 hungry boys under 6yo. When I called back to see where it was I was again greeted with an attitude. Pleasant..right? Well we got to pizza$LABEL$1
I eat here all the time. The food is really great$LABEL$5
First time back since the original owners returned$LABEL$3
Just moved to Tega Cay area and tried this place.  Great value for your money and Kids eat free on Monday.  I think we found our regular Monday dinner option.   Salad bar was nothing special but the staff kept it very clean and replenished.  Staff was very friendly and accommodating to children.  Pizza/Pasta/salad bar was good and convienent.$LABEL$5
I have only gotten air brush spray tans here. They are absolutely wonderful. I have never had a problem being orange or spotty. I will never do a spray booth ever. With the airbrush she can direct the tanning solution to the areas that need it and avoid those that absorb more quickly. They are very professional and friendly. The cost is great compared to the health benefits you get for not tanning in the bed. I have recommended them to many friends. I had one that was in a wedding and needed to fill in a farmers tan$LABEL$5
Alternative Tan is a gem. It's in a quiet little strip center and it took finding them on Yelp to know they were there. The beds are older$LABEL$5
This is my quick stop for busy days. Its filling$LABEL$5
I love Bojangles$LABEL$1
We ordered from them mid day during the week for delivery.  It took 2 hours and our pizza was cold.  We were told by the manager that they would give us a free pizza.  We called back a few days later to order and there was no record of the incident.We will never return.$LABEL$1
The worst thing about coming to Fort Mill is this McDonald's.  First$LABEL$2
Standard McDonald's with a Playplace$LABEL$2
Slow$LABEL$1
I sorry but when you serve my child apples that are two days past The expiration date you get one stars$LABEL$1
I come (or should I say USED to come) to this particular McDonalds about once every three months for three years because of the convenience of the location. It's hard to screw up fast food to this level$LABEL$1
Got done at the shooting range and$LABEL$4
McHale's is a great local bar$LABEL$4
We arrived at McHale's around 7:30 on Friday night$LABEL$2
The service started out well$LABEL$3
We've lived in the area for six years and never made it to McHales until tonight. We knew it would be crowded since it was a Friday night$LABEL$3
McHale's has the promise of being a fantastic pub and a neighborhood favorite. I have only been there once$LABEL$3
After a miserable experience at McHale's in September 2012$LABEL$3
i like this place when they have it all together. some times the service is great sometimes not so much. Sometimes the food is good sometimes its great. but its always good and they have a ton of beer to choose from both on tap and bottles. go before 7 for the happy hour and the best drink and food prices.$LABEL$4
I honestly cannot see giving this establishment a rating higher than a 3.  My 2 rating is due to the following reasons 1) my husband and I went to watch NFL kickoff last Sunday.  Ordered our beer and then attempted to order our food.  I said attempt because they didn't have much to offer.  Every time we made a selection it was either 86 or a component was 86. The explaination we were given was it was very busy Friday night and ran out of stuff - hello it is now Sunday afternoon. You are advertising watching the games at your location.  I pointed out that there is a grocery store within walking distance.  The reply was the owners won't let us buy anything.  I ordered shepards pie which is supposed to be a meat potato and veggie dish. When it showed up at the table it had at least 1/2inch of melted cheese on top a fact not mentioned in the description. After scraping that off I proceeded to dig in. Unfortunately the dish was made with less than an ounce of meat alittle bit of peas and corn and a pile of potatoes. I had the honor of paying $10 for that.  2) OK everyone can have a bad day so we returned this Sunday.  Once again they were out of things but not as bad as last week.  I ordered a specialty burger for $11 Safe right?  Wrong. It came out as any basic burger would except for the fact that the actual patty looked liked someone took a bite out of it.  I called the server over to show her the burger and to ask where the special burger was - her reply - it looks like someone bit into it.  When I asked about the bun vs bagel - oh we don't have those anymore!  There is much more that I can say but this is already a novel. Long story short. The food sucks and we will not return.  One other thing when I told our server about our experience last week she stated that she served an English guy that complained that the shepards pie was the worse he ever ate - I agree.  Time to find another place to go.$LABEL$2
I will attest$LABEL$4
If you're looking for a place to stay when visiting Carowinds$LABEL$4
Four stories$LABEL$4
we stayed here while visiting Carowinds amusement park$LABEL$4
I stayed at the Comfort Inn in Fort Mill$LABEL$3
This hotel was priced very reasonable.  Partly due to the fact that it is across the street from Carowinds Amusement Park and they are closed for the season.  From the outside$LABEL$3
I booked this hotel on Hotwire and what a bust.  First$LABEL$1
Stinky$LABEL$1
Charlotte certainly isn't lacking for Tex-mex food$LABEL$4
Another of the \""pretty darned good\"" Mexican restaurants in the Charlotte area. Maybe it's not perfectly authentic$LABEL$4
Yummy yummy. I had one of the best enchiladas from here. The tacos are good too. I was greeted by a very nice lady and they had my food to me in no time. From the outside its not that flattering but inside its so cute$LABEL$5
Not the best I have had mediocre and generic for that matter. I ordered the carnitas(fried porks pieces) and what I got was like five chunks of dry flavorless pork. Not good kinda left feeling sick. The rest of the food ordered by the rest of my party was none to appetizing either. I recommend going to find a place on or by south blvd in Charlotte  like Azteca it's well worth the extra five minute drive. The only plus to this place was the super sized sodas. Haha$LABEL$2
worst Mexican I've had... and I like the standard Tex Mex that usually all tastes the same and seems like it must be easy to get right$LABEL$1
My experience at El Cancun was okay.  Typical Tex-Mex style food - too much cheese$LABEL$2
This is the second time that I have been here$LABEL$1
Skip. The Enchiladas are like a bad day at a sewage treatment plant. A revolting brown sauce$LABEL$1
Very disappointed$LABEL$1
If you are thinking about hiring Kuester to manage your property$LABEL$1
Run$LABEL$1
If I could give this company a zero rating$LABEL$1
We have worked with Kuester Management Group for years and they have always performed exceptionally well for our community. Their Management was very nice to us and was always available to answer our concerns.$LABEL$5
The nickel and dime comment from Paul is spot on.  I've been sent letters and charged for cleaning siding twice and the work was done and a message left for Kuester with no return call.  I have neighbors with terrible looking yards$LABEL$1
I just happened to go to the Shell gas station and my son said he wanted wendy's to eat. Now we dont normally eat out often but today I said ok. We got the gas$LABEL$1
I was pleased to read that Wendy's had surpassed Burger King and takes the number two spot in the fast food standings. I think Dave Thomas has better burgers and much better not-burgers$LABEL$3
I went during my lunch break after I got some gas.   The location is very convenient with it being right next to Carowinds and a Shell station. However$LABEL$2
This is my second time coming to this location in a month. Its right there w/ where I regularly get gas during lunch. You would think that w/ it being right next to Carowinds and its the summertime that it would be faster during lunch time . Today's visit was not any different. They only had one person taking orders at 12:30 and the drive thru had like 4 cats waiting for orders to be taken. Workers behind the counter didn't know what people ordered so they were confused. If this place wasn't connected to the gas station I like to use$LABEL$2
Pretty good. Buffet is decent. Nothing exceptional$LABEL$3
DeMarco's is OK... a little pricey for dinner.  Their pizza is TINY.  Their lunch buffet is a much better deal.$LABEL$2
We went from University City to Fort Mill on St. Patrick's day$LABEL$3
Had dinner here last night.  Service was pleasant and efficient.  Eggplant Parm was SALTY.  Veal Parm was tough and so thin.  Maybe 1/16 inch?  The breading was thicker than the veal.  At least the veal wasn't the pressed type.  Will probably not go back except perhaps to try the pizza.$LABEL$1
Very forgettable. Ordered the daily special$LABEL$2
I will not return$LABEL$1
We've been to DeMarco's 30-40 times in 3 years but the service is progressively becoming worse and worse.  Food is still very good for the price but recently a waitress on Friday night informed us that the food will be a while because the owner is also the chef (and the only chef at that).  Amazingly$LABEL$2
I have had better and I have had worse. The food is average$LABEL$2
When I lived in Tega Cay$LABEL$3
it's ok nothing special$LABEL$3
I've eaten at this place a few too many times. Everyone in town always seems to want to meet up here$LABEL$2
Meh... We stumbled upon this place on our way back from Rock Hill to Charlotte. We were hungry and hung over and said$LABEL$2
Tried again and it was worse.  I didn't like it.  Ordered a combo plate beef burrito$LABEL$2
El Maguey doesn't vary too much from other Americanized Mexican places in the Charlotte area.  They have the complimentary chips and salsa and plenty of combinations along with some specialties.  It is probably a very slight step up from Zapata's and Charanda's but it's no la Poblanita.  The food was a little over priced.  $11 for about 5 oz of chicken topped with spinach and cheese and a side of beans and rice.  Our services was somewhat slow despite only one other tabe in thie place and three servers.  I'd go back but it probably wouldn't be my 1st choice for Mexican.$LABEL$3
I ordered an enchilada and a burrito lunch combo and couldn't tell which was which --  not a great start .... I had the beans with it so the whole plate was an unappetizing grayish- brown.  The chicken in the meal was the same color... Bland; not terrible -- you could live off of it if you were starving and that's about the best thing I can say about it.The Salsa that came before the meal was EXCELLENT; so it wasn't a totally wasted lunch.  Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing; and hit them on the wrong day.  I stay in search of a really good Mexican meal in the area!!!$LABEL$2
Only people in the place and the waitress messed up a simple order. Chili verde was ok but not worth $11. Husband had chicken & cheese enchiladas and said they were bland.$LABEL$1
Cute little village conveniently located off the interstate! Full of shops$LABEL$4
The best in family resturants!  Great diverse menu$LABEL$5
If you're looking for a great place to spend a few hours on a nice afternoon$LABEL$4
So I have always said this place is like an Adult Toys R Us for Alcoholics.....LOL.  If your looking for a great deal on Alcohol this is the place to go.  Its right over the NC state line in SC$LABEL$5
Frugal MacDoogal's is a nice beer and liquor warehouse located on the state line next to Carowinds.  One side is for beer and wine and the other is for liquor.  They are carrying more and more craft beers$LABEL$4
Frugal MacDoogal's gives me the same giddy tingling feeling that I get from going to Earthfare.  Why?  Maybe it's because I always hit Frugal's before a road trip (The alcohol is for the destination...or is it?)  Maybe it's because the sight of Carowinds excites me.  I think it's because Frugal's is kind of like a candy store for adults that drink alcohol.The liquor side and the beer/wine side are both filled with domestic and imported gems of adult mood enhancers.  If I'm looking for something a little unusual$LABEL$4
A little bored with the Charlotte area we thought we'd head south...  Decent selection of beer (nothing to write home about) it seems like it's more geared toward wine and liquor enthusiasts (aka drunks ;-)  I did get a good deal on some New Belgium beer ($5 Belgo 6-pack and $9.99 Folly 12-pack)  These were discounted since they were really close to their \""best by\"" date.  All in all worth the trip for us$LABEL$4
The best reason to go here? The prices. Ermahgerd.Second best reason? Wider selection than any ABC store in Mecklenburg county.Okay$LABEL$4
I love going to Frugal to get fulfill my party needs! They have 2 sides - one for liquor and one for wine$LABEL$4
I am in total adoration of this place.  Like a kid in a toy store$LABEL$4
I like Frugals$LABEL$4
I finally got the chance to stop in here and check out what they have to offer.  Very clean space$LABEL$4
Huge selection$LABEL$4
Great place and well worth the drive if you are coming over the border from NC. Have used Frugals many times$LABEL$4
By far the biggest selection in town in one location. If they don't have it then ask and they will find it.$LABEL$5
T-Bones is that place you go if you're boating on Lake Wylie and want to grab some bar food on the patio. Think Rusty Rudder on Lake Norman$LABEL$2
There's a reason this place only averages 2.5 stars.This is what I consider a boaters paradise..... It is where boaters come to watch and to be seen. It is common to have quite a few beers while watching the boats try to aimlessly dock in a narrow slip with amateur boaters.  I will refer to this event as the bumper boats at T-Bones.I am perplexed at the statement that they take reservations$LABEL$3
I'm so over T-Bones.I used to relish the thought of hanging out on their big deck on one of the first warm days of the year$LABEL$1
Giving it 3 stars for the outdoor area.  The only food I've had is their spinach quesadilla which was okay.  Nice place to grab a drink and listen to some live music. outdoor on the lake.$LABEL$3
This place has went downhill bad. I remember going here for prom or when people would visit from out of town. Now im not so sure. The service sucks. The food is pretty mediocre. I was there on a Friday night and ordered the prime rib only to be informed that they were out. So I ordered a ribye and it was ok. The steak was cooked right but just didn't have much flavor. After dinner we went on the deck so my daughter could feed the ducks. When I got out there I grabbed a chair so she could see over the deck and the bartender rudely told me that I can't use the chair. It is only for people sitting at the bar. I hope this place fixes some of these problems because I want to like it again$LABEL$2
I visited this place this weekend$LABEL$2
Great place to pull up to in your boat and get a drink on the deck and watch people navigate the traffic jam of finding a boat slip on a busy summer day. The food is ok. They market it as a Texas place and while the memorabilia decor inside is true Texan the food is only ok. All in all not a bad place to hang out on a summer day.$LABEL$3
My husband and I came here for lunch on a Thursday. The wait staff was helpful and service was quick. The views were nice$LABEL$2
Classy.That is sarcasm.  But$LABEL$2
T-Bones is well below average. Starting with the drinks. Tea was very weak and the glasses were very small. Appetizer$LABEL$1
Service was good$LABEL$1
Location$LABEL$3
Unfortunately this is the only place on Lake Wylie to eat when you are out on your boat other than a snack bar. The deck and the boat docks are the only reason they are still in business. If you want a drink order beer or wine. The drinks are watered down and shots are limited because the premium liquor selections are limited.  The food leaves a lot to be desired.  We ordered the smoked chicken quesadilla$LABEL$1
I never realized how gross this place was$LABEL$1
Nice night for a ride across the border but sadly that place just sucks. I was better when it was the Hungry Fisherman like 25 years ago.$LABEL$2
If you get the chicken club you're okay otherwise  stay away from pretty much anything else but the salads.   We were there tonight and got the food in a somewhat timely fashion the waitress hostess however would not seat us until our entire party of 12 arrived otherwise she would in \""get in trouble\"" Which was ridiculous so we had to wait around and not able to sit down.    Then$LABEL$2
T-Bones is always a fun spot to hangout with a nice view of Lake Wylie$LABEL$4
No good. And it's a big shame because with the awesome location If they actually had decent food this place could be jumpin every night. My mom who's been here several times warned us before we left \""we go here for the views and to be outside some nights$LABEL$2
Great atmosphere and location$LABEL$1
Food and decor are horrific. Only redeeming factor is its location; well that and the fact that it's closed 8 hours a day.....$LABEL$1
Been here 3 times and no more for me. No matter if I go for lunch or dinner$LABEL$2
As everyone that goes to TBones remarks$LABEL$2
I feel as though I needed to write this review. This is just tragic that such a prime  location on the lake has terrible food$LABEL$1
Location is perfect. Live music was super good on the deck.  But the food... oh my.. Expect fast food quality here. The fish taco tastes like something you get from a frozen box. There is absolutely no flavor on it.  I wish this place was more unique. Not just the typical lower end American Cuisine  (burger/fries/fried chicken tenders/fried fish..) that you get at any Walmart. Service was not bad. I only wrote this review$LABEL$2
Disappointed! Menu looked good but very expensive. The food was average. I can see no justification for their prices. Our main entrees were delivered to the table before our appetizer and salads. I can understand having problems if it's busy but it wasn't. I'm very disappointed in everything about this restaurant. We won't be coming back unless we have to$LABEL$1
This is the worst example of a \""Steakhouse\"" ever.  The owner is a self righteous fool that loves to cause trouble if you give feedback.  Lousy place on Lake wylie$LABEL$1
Snagged some lunch on the water and got in right as they opened. The waiter/waitress staff seemed to miss us coming in because we wanted 15 minutes before I had to get up and ask them to serve us. They were apologetic and nice$LABEL$3
We have been going to TBones on the Lake for years.  We live on Lake Wylie so it is a nice boat ride.  The reviews I read about the cleanliness is right on. Tonight was the worst in service and food.  The kid that waited on us got our order incorrect.  My fish and chips came without the chips.  I had ordered slaw as an extra side.  The slaw came and was awful. I was afraid to eat a lot of it.  My fries came after we were pretty much through eating.  They tasted like they had been cooked in burnt grease.  Then he charged me for them.  We always leave a great tip because we know how hard it is to be a server but tonight my husband left a tip saying  bad service ; bad tip. This place needs renovation and cleaned up desperately.  Some of the best flounder I have ever eaten used to come from here.  I am sad to see it go down hill.   We also had a family near us that couldn't control their kids and I think they thought we were at a McDonalds Play land. Tonight was a miserable time here. We will probably come back home to eat from now on when going on a boat ride.$LABEL$1
Lake is very nice. But$LABEL$2
Ok.  I try this place 2 or 3 times a year praying it will get better.   I live i n the lake and its the only place to go if your out for a boat ride.  Without fail its always the same.   Dirty.... I'm looking at a spider web hanging from a moose head as I write this.   Sloooow service.   Poor to standard food.  If it wasn't for the monopoly of being on the lake they would be out of business.$LABEL$1
I would have given it 2.5 stars but you have to go with 2 or 3. Pro's: location$LABEL$2
We have eaten here several times and the food has been good - the blackened prime rib on Saturday evening is to die for. So we thought we would try the Sunday breakfast buffet and Bloody Mary bar. My advice - go to IHOP or Denny's instead. The breakfast \""buffet\"" was no more that a glorified lets-throw-some-typical-mediocre-breakfast-items on a couple of tables and call it  Breakfast Buffet. I went expecting rather a brunch - i.e.: breakfast AND lunch items - after all$LABEL$3
After reading other reviews$LABEL$1
On a whim tonight$LABEL$1
Gone Downhill from the last time I was here.We have a friend from Ohio who used to work for Continental Tire and we went here with here several times over the years and always enjoyed it. I can remember several great steaks here and the name implies.Been a number or years since we have been so since my wife and I were in the area today$LABEL$2
As you can tell from all the other ratings$LABEL$2
Great location in the old Hungry Fisherman restaurant on the water on Lake Wylie. Lousy food.$LABEL$2
Certainly will not be back! Disgustingly filthy and the decor is atrocious to say the least. By the time I left and by the way my stomach felt$LABEL$1
Best thing about here is the view.  Went for Sunday brunch and was very disappointed.  Poor selection$LABEL$2
Arrived late on a Friday night and had no wait time. Staff was very friendly and food was good. I had the Hawaiian quesadilla and would get it again for sure!  Probably not going to be added to my favorite Mexican places$LABEL$3
This place is awesome! I am so glad we came here instead. Food was great and service was awesome! Come here if u want some awesome Mexican food!$LABEL$5
Hola amigos.  Rey Azteca is your typical Mexican restaurant... the music$LABEL$2
Great little hidden joint just across Buster Boyd Bridge in SC.  Just like most all Mexican Restaurants they start you off with Chips & Salsa. The salsa was great! It was well favored with the right amount of kick. It you don't like spicy this my be a little hot. I ordered the combination #18 (burrito$LABEL$4
Meh$LABEL$1
This was the worst Mexican food I've ever had!! First off ordered a margarita came to the table looking very weak and it tasted even worse I had to send it back! I decided to just go with a draft beer which is very hard to screw up. They give you free chips with salsa the salsa was nothing special either no kick$LABEL$1
Very well lit and clean.  I feel safe going to this gas station at any time$LABEL$5
I had a fraxel treatment done here to remove some hyperpigmentation.  Along with the $1000 treatment (and this was 5 years ago)$LABEL$1
Good truck stop dining at the right price. We love coming here on the weekends when we don't feel like cooking.$LABEL$4
Only went here once about a year and a half ago$LABEL$4
Great truck stop restaurant.  I've had breakfast and dinner here and it has always been good.  Huge portions and reasonable prices.  The bakery I guess is legendary.  They have doughnuts the size of your head!  Eclairs the size of your arm and Cream Puffs that are about 10\"" high.  On our most recent trip in the area$LABEL$4
Ate a Saturday morning breakfast at the Pine Cone.  Friendly$LABEL$3
i rarely give five star reviews but for what this restaurant is$LABEL$5
With a recent addition of a truck driver for a BF I have found myself frequenting truck stops to dine. This little place is quite a pleasant surprise. Basically it is just great home cooking. Everything is homemade and quite good. The baked goods in the front counter were amazing. The size of the cinnamon rolls was insane. And of course I couldn't leave without a piece of pie.$LABEL$4
I was dining here with my boyfriend when I was served chili and mac with HAIR wound into my fork. I had barely taken 3 bites when I noticed this$LABEL$1
This is definitely not your usual truck stop. Pastries look delicious. Dinner rolls are large enough for a meal themselves and good!  We had a young waitress who I think was new. We found her to be sweet$LABEL$3
Continuing on my Saturday morning hangover theme: there's just something about a plateful of greasy food when you're slightly hung over that makes it all better. The Pine Cone has down-home$LABEL$3
This place was excellent. We were a little nervous because it is in a truck stop but the food was absolutely delicious and the service was fast and friendly.$LABEL$5
Went here for lunch with two co-workers$LABEL$1
My boyfriend and I came here to have breakfast after New Years. We weren't expecting much being not at our best either. The service$LABEL$2
Californians are all about the In-N-Out$LABEL$5
Go-to meal: cheddar butter burger$LABEL$5
Everything was great except for the burgers they are greasy and very charred compared to other stores.$LABEL$3
Stopped for food on our way home from a weekend in MN. Service was good$LABEL$3
Just seemed to be renovated because I stayed there before and now it's like a different place.  Had a flat screen TV and it looked a lot more modern and was clean!$LABEL$5
Extremely well run ! Great breakfast$LABEL$4
A modern shopping experience (back in the 80s)I paid a visit to the DeForest Pick n Save earlier today and it was exactly as I remembered it when I lived in DeFo 15 years ago$LABEL$2
Not impressed. The prices here seem to keep going up and up and nothing changes in the store design or layout. Seems dated. Produce could use a makeover.8 out of 10 times I will drive all the way to Madison to another store.$LABEL$2
This is a sorry excuse for a grocery store$LABEL$1
