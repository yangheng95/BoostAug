Don't waste your time.  We had two different people come to our house to give us estimates for a deck (one of them the OWNER).  Both times!ref!1
All I can say is the worst! We were the only 2 people in the place for lunch!ref!1
I have been to this restaurant twice and was disappointed both times. I won't go back. The first time we were there almost 3 hours. It took forever to order and then forever for our food to come and the place was empty. When I complained the manager was very rude and tried to blame us for taking to long to order. It made no sense!ref!1
Food was NOT GOOD at all! My husband & I ate here a couple weeks ago for the first time. I ordered a salad & basil pesto cream pasta & my husband ordered the spinach & feta pasta. The salad was just a huge plate of spring mix (nothing else in it) with WAY to much vinegar dressing. My lettuce was drowning in the vinegar. My pesto pasta had no flavor (did not taste like a cream sauce to me) & the pesto was so runny/watery & way too much sauce not enough noodles. My husband's pasta had even less flavor than mine. We ate about a quarter of the food & couldn't even finish it. We took it home & it was so bad I didn't even eat my leftovers. And I hate wasting food!! Plus the prices are expensive for the amount of food you get & of course the poor quality. Don't waste your time eating here. There are much better Italian restaurants in Pittsburgh.!ref!1
This is a tiny Starbucks and it locations like this (although cute) makes you wonder if your really meant to hang out or just grab your coffee and leave. Leaving is always a good idea at this location anyway since you have a nice fountain in the back with benches and it is a central part of the Waterfront Shopping. Starbuck isn't my favorite coffee chain by any means. Is it just me or do all Starbuck coffees taste a little burnt and bitter? No matter how trendy!ref!3
Typical Starbucks coffee chain. 2 things I dont like about this Starbucks: 1. Ive been there twice and both times the place has been dirty!ref!2
So.Much.Fun! I WISH I could play a song at the drop of a hat. Too bad I never took piano lessons and I'd probably end up mumbling half the lyrics other than the chorus. Unless it's Salt n' Pepa's Shoop. This is a really great place to go when you have out of town guests or are looking for a fun place to take someone for a birthday celebration or a fun night out. It's just something different to do other than boozing it up at the bars on a Saturday night. Keep in mind you'll be paying around a $5-10 cover plus whatever drinks and food you get. The good thing is the food is coming from the attached Rock Bottom Brewery. So a lot of it is restaurant quality good. Plus the brewery beer is actually pretty good! OF course you will be paying restaurant price drinks...so of course they're up charged a bit. But you do pay for the whole experience....so you gotta get into the spirit with some spirits! The guys who play are incredibly talented. There's 2 guys that will take requests and play songs on the piano. They pretty much play ANYTHING you ask. Contemporary songs!ref!4

Stopped by on a Mon evening after trying to dine at Smoke Taqueria which is closed Mondays. Parking on street in front or behind off Hay St. Super friendly bartender. In warmer months they have huge outdoor area & big screen & upstairs cornhole game area. Okay draft beer selection and big bottle selection. Tried the italian club which was really good - two of us split one. Also tried sweet potato fries - amazingly good! Home made chips w bleu were overpowered by sauce. Bathroom was in need of plaster and wall repairs & was grossed out by toilet brush/holder on a shelf near toilet at eye level. Bet it's a fun place in warmer months.!ref!3

We came here on a Saturday night and luckily it wasn't as packed as I thought it would be. I love playing ticket games so luckily there were a lot of games to chose from and not many video games (sorry video game lovers!) We only played $20 worth of games and surprisingly we were there for awhile. I love their new Wheel of Fortune game! On our first play!ref!4

Microbrewed beers are only a plus to me when they're better than the beer I would have drank otherwise.  One waitress I had while there tried to split the uprights between macrobrew and trendy by describing one of their beers as \""kind of like Coors Light\"".  If I wanted Coors!ref!2

The evites are in the mail for the 2 for $99 special! You will have to spend $24 on a parking pass. I signed up last year for this promotion and don't think I got the passes worth. The waterpark is nice and lounging by the pool or floating around the lazy river is perfect for a hot summer day. There are just too many misses in my book though.1st off all Traffic is a biatch! Be ready to sit on browns hill rd for a very long time unless you leave before 9am and wait for the park to open at 10am. Next remember it is a family park so there will be lots of rude and bratty kids all over the place. (I'm not a mean kid hater) my experiences have been bad at the Sandbar pool. If you do arrive early enough you will be standing in the hot sun with a gang of kids that WILL push you out of the way and run to claim 10 chairs with towels even though they won't use them because they run around the park all day. I actually got into an argument last summer with one said kid. I was like \""I'm an adult and you need to have some respect.\"" He pushed me and took all the chairs. I only needed one and his mother did not correct him. I was on fire and moved a chair over from the back and he still was giving me crap because I moved the chairs over...THAT NO ONE was even there to sit in at the time. Damn! FOR REAL!Sandbar drinks are expensive and incredibly weak. Plus they are so sugary. If you do get a frozen drink and sit by the pool be prepared for it to be half pool water in a few minutes. An Adult area would change all this. I don't even care that I'm getting splashed all the time I do realize that I'm at a pool but it's hard to relax.If you do get a pass have a friend who can get there the same days you can go. If you're trying to go on the weekend forget it! The weekdays are bad enough. I'm looking for a better pool side lounge for this summer.!ref!2
This place is kind of a hybrid of Applebee's and CPK!ref!3

REDO!I went to PF Chang's several years ago and was NOT pleased with the food that was presented to me.  My issue: I thought I was getting Chinese food.  My resolution: Try this restaurant again knowing that it is just reinvented American food with names of those Chinese dishes I actually like to eat.So we returned to PF Chang's for lunch to try this American food in this caricature of a Chinese restaurant.  There were very few people in the restaurant.  The two of us were seated in the largest corner booth and left to review our menus.  When our waitress finally arrived we ordered the following items:Coca ColaIced TeaPan fried pork dumplingsSesame chicken lunch with white rice and egg drop soupChangs chicken with white riceOur drinks and my soup came out immediately.  Unfortunately I was brought the wrong soup and the server had disappeared before I had a chance to say anything.  I could see her across the barren wasteland that was the dining room and we even made eye contact several times!ref!2

Very very good chain family restaurant. I had their yellowfin tuna steak shanghai style and it was great. Service was excellent and the party of 5 I was with swore they could eat there every week as the menu was extremely diverse. It's hard for me to give a chain 5/5 but this is pretty close.!ref!4

Superbowl Sunday at the Blues. i came to meet a group of friends to watch the \"" who really cares about this game\""  show. I was mainly interested in seeing Madonna. I do have to say that we had a server who gave us the utmost attention. We had been seated at some tables near the bar mid restaurant that were wobbling and driving me crazy. At the request of the party she moved us up front and center to a much better and stable seat. Much better view to see the Material girl! So our server gets 5 STARS! Not only for that reason!ref!2
Pass on this place!ref!2
Wings are overpriced. And the quality of them are bad. They were tough and greasy. The staff are pleasant but then over all experience was too expensive for a sports bar.!ref!2

The Park House is a great place to drink. They have a very good beer selection and even though the kitchen is a 4 foot by 4 foot square behind the bar the food is really good. They have all you can eat Popcorn and Peanuts so you will never be in want of something to snack on while drinking your favorite beer. They have live bands several times a week my favorite being Tuesdays which often features local Blue Grass musicians.  The down side to this place for me is that it's a little on the expensive side. They have a majority of their beers that are 6+ bucks a pint which a bit much. You can get some for $4.50 - $5  but it cuts your selection significantly. It definitely makes you think twice before going here often. I just wish all their beers were under $5 because I would probably try and go here more often.  Over all it's a great bar the owner is a nice guy and you're going to have a great time.!ref!4

The Penna Parma was outstanding and the Parm crusted salmon over whole wheat artichoke ravioli with a white basil sauce on special tonight was a great combo and wonderfully executed.

This Giant Eagle maybe the worst supermarket I've ever been to. There are thugs hanging out by the entrance and in the parking lot. The interior is dark and dank and has an outdated \""made in the 70s\"" feel. With options like this I don't have a problem taking the extra time to drive to Trader Joe's.!ref!1
The only reason to shop here is that going anywhere else is out of your way. The prices our worse than other GE stores and I wonder why. The produce is not very fresh and the meats never looks good . The store never looks very clean. I was hopeful a couple of years ago when the store was refurbished and it was nicer for a while but now it's back to it's old ways.

Spent the weekend and Pittsburgh and started out Friday night at Mad Mex for Happy Hour and some dinner. Happy Hour was a pretty good deal with half price wings and cheap drafts.

It didn't taste bad but I definitely had better Mexican elsewhere even elsewhere in Pittsburgh.!ref!3

Ok so my first experience at princess nails could be described as slightly awkward but totally worth it. When I went into the salon I didn't realize how cramped it actually was it didn't look too clean to be honest. But anyway I had called earlier in the week to see if they took appointments and they told me they didn't so I walked in to get my eyebrows waxed. When I arrived I said what I wanted done not knowing that I had to sit further up near the waxing chair to be waited on next before some woman cut ahead of me. But when I actually did get my eyebrows waxed by this older asian woman who went by michelle I believed she did a fantastic job of thinning out my eyebrows and surprisingly after telling her \""thinner\"" 5 times she made them absolutely stunning and for only 10 dollars. Although its not much to look at when you go in getting my eyebrows waxed at Princess Nails was the best decision I ever made.*NOTE* My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing. Unfortunately I do not get my nails done. EVER. So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY.!ref!3
Like I said before in my first post about Princess Nails. Its definitely dingy and and as hole in the wall as you can get. But Michelle oh my is this woman amazing. Second visit to get my eyebrows waxed was just as worthwhile as the first. ASK FOR MICHELLE. I'm not going to rate this 5 stars simply because of the lack of cleaniness BUT what would they do without Michelle.*NOTE* My rating is based on Eyebrow Waxing. Unfortunately I do not get my nails done. EVER. So please keep in mind when reading my review for this location that it is solely based on my experience with waxing and waxing ONLY.!ref!4
I went to M.C.N salon because I had seen positive reviews on Yelp. I have to say the reviews were right. It was one of the best salon experiences I've ever had.

The PAT buses aren't nearly as bad as many Pittsburghers make it to be. People complain about having to do transfers downtown!ref!4
The only pro about Port Authority is it gets you from point a to point b. I've had buses that smell like pee. I've had buses where the bus drivers are yelling at drivers or people downtown. Screaming insults out the window.  Had a bus driver doing like 70mph down McKnight road. At least twice a week I get a bus that's farebox is broke.  Yeah a free ride is nice but port authority is always crying wanting to increase their already ridiculous fare prices. Routes are always getting cut which leaves buses jam packed. They introduce the connect card (an alternative to cash and passes. If I load $20.00 onto the card I should be able to get a transfer without entering cash the drivers don't know that and argue about it.  Feel free to train your employees. On an 80 degree day one buses heat was on full blast. Not the drivers fault. He finally pulled over restarted the bus and it read 98 degrees before the air worked.Buses are late all the time.  When going to work I need to leave at least an hour before I should have to!ref!1

Have you ever watched them make this sandwich?  It's a special craft for sure.  They take two pieces of white Italian bread.

I just moved here back in September and one of the first places i was told to go for great food was Primanti Bros. The food was great as I was told from several people from the area and back home.What I was not happy with was the setting policy and service. Just to get a seat here I had to wait standing up watching people eat like a creepy stalker just to see who would get up first and finally when I got a seat no one cleaned our table for a while or even took our order cause no one even knew we had been seated. If we were bad people we could have stolen the check from the last table as they had paid with cash. Once we got a servers attention and got the table cleared and our drinks and food ordered the server forgot our drinks and when we where finally able to flag her down our food came out not even 5 minutes later. In total about a 30-40 minute wait from arrival to food. Don't even think about getting a refill I had to walk in and ask the bartender for refills for me and my family after being ignored several times. When we were done we wanted to leave but couldn't till we paid the bill and because we paid with credit card we had to wait for the server to return with our card. It took so long and with other people looking at us to get the hell up so they could sit we just walked in to retrieve the card at was just sitting on the back of the bar and had not yet been processed so I had to wait again.Food can only get you so far!ref!2

I would give it 3.5 stars. It was a solid sandwich for sure. I got the corned beef which was tasty the only thing I wish they added was some kind of sauce. I'm not sure if that comes on other sandwiches but it could have used some kind of mustard. The price is great too!ref!3
I found the sandwich I ate at Primanti Bros to be quite tasty!  As others have mentioned!ref!3

This is a solid downtown lunch break spot. They run a special between like 11-2 where you can get 3 cuts buffet style (with lots of different types) with a pop for 6 or 7 bucks.

I love this place. I eat here anytime I go downtown for anything. Always get the Gyro with extra meat and sauce. So amazing. YUM!!ref!5
Not the best ever!ref!3
This is the first time in a long while (10 yrs?) and now I remember why. The food is fair at best for the main meal. The salad is good but small. The hummus is a little bland. The best parts were the \""homemade\"" wine!ref!2

I was walking back and forth through downtown over a series of days and saw Madonna's. I made it a point to tell myself that I should stop in and get myself something to eat. I love Tex-Mex food and am always looking for new places to patronize. I stopped in during lunch and ordered a steak burrito with guacamole to go. When I received my order I immediately opened it to take a bite. I was immediately underwhelmed. I saw that they had some Tapatio and added it to the full course of my burrito and took my leave of the little corner store.The best part of the burrito was the Tapatio that I added after the fact. The issues with it were myriad. My biggest issue was the utter lack of any taste. That's right!ref!2
Well!ref!2

average at best. Best view of the city by far though. Go in summer or no point in going. The beer battered fish is good!ref!2
Rotten food and over charging customer.I was expecting at least a reasonable dinning experience at a reputed restaurant!ref!1
They must get patrons here in because of the could reviews from the other Tambellini restaurant or from being close to the theater district.  The food is pretty bad for an Italian restaurant.  The Chicken Parmigiana was very bready and I question if it was homemade.  I ordered a side salad and it was all iceberg lettuce.  The homemade bread was very sorry.....  Not worth the price.  The decor is very plain.  Service was fine.!ref!2
It's just not that good. We initially told the waitress that we only going to order appetizers and desert. My code for \""we read on Yelp this place sucks!ref!1
The only good thing about this eatery is its proximity to the Benedum. The three of us were seated at a table that was jammed in between two other tables!ref!1

I hate being the person that brings bad news to a business.  But I would rather Yelp about it and people know rather than it goes unnoticed.  More on that later in the review. I booked this stay about two months prior to me showing up on New Year's Eve.  Check it went fairly smooth with a little bump.  I forgot one of my IDs in my car and could not be checked in until after I had that ID in hand.  After walking back to my car I returned and everything went smoothly afterwards.  Kudos to the front desk staff for allowing me to leave my bag there instead of having to drag it back to my car and back to the hotel.The room itself gave the impression that it was huge.  As several people have already stated!ref!3

Disagree with previous post. Went to 1902 tavern for lunch a few weeks back. To start the waiter appeared to be either on crack or speed. Second I was with a party of 4 that all ordered salads. I decided to go with the steak. Awful call on my part. The salad took 45 minutes to arrive!ref!2

Good Coffee and Travel Advice!  What more can you ask?A buddy and I decided to explore the strip district one Saturday and found this gem of a coffee shop.    We ordered a couple a Cappuccino's.

this is a great place for those who enjoy looking at art and an alright place for a student like me to learn about art as a requirement for class. This gallery was by far... the most attention grabbing because of its electric show... although I didn't understand the concept of it all... I really enjoyed my time there... I got some great photos from the trip... so it was a worth that much :)!ref!4

Very nice hotel. First time staying here. Stayed for three nights. Room was on the 9th floor.Hotel staff are very friendly and helpful. Room was huge! I could have fit 40 or so people in my room if I had to.Cons:- Older CRT-based!ref!4
We stayed here after getting an awesome deal on Priceline for $90 per night. I admit that if I'd paid full price I'd have been a little annoyed at the size of the room. It felt pretty small!ref!4
Last time I stayed here was three years ago - stayed for three nights. This time was for one overnight only.The AC in my room was not working well. It was enough to cool off the room - but it still felt a tad on the humid side. Again!ref!3

Last barber on the left was who helped me. Very nice but not very skilled. He uses plastic guards for his shears and also I noticed after washing my hair I have very thin parts that were cut much shorter than the rest of my hair. Luckily my hair grows fast.

Don't believe the hype.Was in the Pittsburgh area for one day and decided to try the pho here.  It was a toss up between Pho Minh and here.  I think I chose wrong.A rule of thumb is a good ethnic restaurant will be swarming with that particular ethnic people.  When I went!ref!1

Sometimes at four in the morning you need a place to eat!ref!3
2.5 but I rounded down.This is not a place you go to eat out but it's rather a emergency stop when you have no other place to go perhaps 4 in the morning. Cash only. Doesn't separate the check so if you are eathing with somebody else figure it out among yaselves.I'm not a big fan of diner's and haven't been to one so I don't have anything to compare to but like I said!ref!2

I wouldn't say it's the best burger I've had!ref!3
In theory!ref!2
Had the best burger of my life at Tessaro's over the weekend. I ordered the Guacamole Burger (on the specials menu) and was not disappointed. The burger was large and packed with flavor. The guacamole was tasty and creamy and topped my burger off perfectly. I liked that they had so many options for sides with their meals. I opted for the cole-slaw and it was very good as well.Our waitress was extremely personable and our food came quick.I don't give a lot of 5-star ratings but this place deserves one.  My burger was cooked to perfection. Great quality food!ref!5

I was visiting for the weekend and we were looking for somewhere to go watch the LSU versus Alabama game and we chose Lot 17. When we arrived we were able to find seats at the bar since there was barely anyone there. They have a nice selection of draft beers. The food was definitely above average for a bar. The sweet potato fries are as good as advertised and the dipping sauce could be consumed with a straw but the TV selection leaves a little to be desired. I understand it is a PITT bar but with 95% of the bar focused on the LSU/Alabama game you would think they could have moved the PITT game to a corner TV and use the center TV with sound for the majority of the bar that was concerned in the 'Epic' game. They did switch the games around while PITT was at half but as soon as that game started the LSU game was back relegated to the corner. The manager even made some comment that our group didn't appreciate but whatever it's not like I will be back anytime soon. If you are looking for some good bar food I say stop on by. If you are looking to watch a big game outside of Pennsylvania sports you may want to choose elsewhere or be relegated to the corner without sound.!ref!2
i was very excited to try this place.  thai is one of my favorite cuisines ever!!!  but i was sorrily disappointed. we started with spring rolls!ref!1

Yes the pizza is the best in the burgh.  But don't don't forget the wings.  They also have the best wings in the burgh.  They don't deliver.  They don't have to.  I'd drive for miles.!ref!5
Other than being open late to convenience myself and my inebriated friends I didn't like nor dislike this place. It was quite small and looked dirty. The pizza was large enough to share between me and 5 people and to absorb some alcohol. It wasn't horrible.!ref!3
My girlfriend is much newer to the area so I try to take her to real Pittsburgh places. Fiori's should be held right up there next to Primanti's as a staple. South Hills icon.

NEVER EVER get the All-you-can-Eat. Hibachi plates are basically plates of panfried squash with a little meat that isn't even grilled. They give you nigiri sushi instead of sashimi. It's like they are trying to stuff us full of rice and squash so we fill up quickly. Also!ref!1
This place has been on my list since I became a \""foodie\"" (quotes intended) ... and finally I was in town with the flexibility to go.It's worth it ...

I wanted to try on a $400 fur...and the guy said it was very expensive and would hand carry it to the front mirror for me.  He then advised me to take off my vest and waited for me to do so.

I'd give this joint zero stars if it was possible.  This is the worst spot on Walnut St!  I'm not even sure where to start. The bar is small and overpriced. I had a steak fajita wrap that tasted microwaved.  The vegetables weren't even cooked. This is a place no one wants to--or should ever want to go.!ref!1
With such great reviews I have been trying! I have been there tree times now and I am not surprised! The prices are reasonable and you get decent food. But thats not what I expected. The chocolate and caramel trotewas bad! The cupcakes were ok but for 1usd you can't expect much. The buttercream wasnt impressive... But the filled croissants with blueberry or the one with cheese were not bad at all. It was not a real croissant but satisfying. Since it is in a really convenient location I will probably go back but without the expectations that I had before.!ref!3

Iv'e been to better places. I always forget that they dont take a card so I have to remember to get cash out when I go there. I usually order their omelets. The veggies are always crunchy so I taste more of a raw onion than I do my omelet. The food comes out fast which is great until I tasted the food. I checked it out three or four times  to see if it might be different but the omelets were the same. Raw and crunchy. overall  nice atmosphere!ref!3

This is a decent hotel.  Decent for a quick over-nighter if you've missed a flight.  But it's not good for longer stays or repeat visits.  The building itself needs updating.  The food at breakfast is OK. But lunch/dinner is like bar food.  Half of the floors don't have vending machines.  One of the floors that does does not offer drinks.  One machine that offered drinks keeps your money without providing a drink.  The other working machine is all out of stock.  Bottled water in the room is $4.00 (before they tack on other BS charges).  Internet access is $9.95 per day.  3G reception in the building is horrible too!  It's missing most of the things that make longer stays tolerable.I'd recommend staying somewhere else if you can!!ref!2
I now understand where the name comes from. Yesterday I went into Dick's to buy my daughter some shirts. As we were checking out I noticed a bin that was full of bags that had sports watches and body bands to monitor vital signs. I started going through them to find a watch that would meet my workout needs. Most of the bags that contained these watches were missing something. Not a problem because the outside clearly noted what was wrong with the package. It said things like \"" missing manual or dead battery\"" I found a watch that was missing a manual. I went online and looked up the watch and it had what i was looking for. I purchased the watch as is and took it home. After trying to sync the watch to the body strap monitor for an hour!ref!1

I was quoted a price for a new pair of glasses and lenses that were in the 50% area. Came back the next day excited to buy the glasses and was told the glasses were not on sale for 50% and that the quote someone gave me the day before was wrong. The new quote was DOUBLE what I was quoted the day before! Not only was I disappointed about the price!ref!1
Seriously!ref!1
We ordered the lobster and shrimp dip. We had to send it back twice because it was too cheeseeeee.. yes!! The chips kept breaking whenever we dipped it in the sauce because the cheese made it to heavy. They ended up taking it off the bill. We then tried the parmesan chicken and bake potato. It was gooood!!! It was enough for two to share.!ref!4

Anything shiny grabs my attention immediately. I easily get distracted in Jared's. I went in to repair a bracelet I purchased over a year ago and I found myself lusting over case after case of jewelry.Jared's offers great customer service. I purchased a couple items from one of their stores in Arizona and the location here was more than willing to help repair without charge. In both locations I've encountered very nice sales staff.You cannot go wrong with buying me something at this store!!ref!5
New menus at ihop means higher prices! Wonderful. It seems that everything on the menu has gone up by at least $1.00 across the board. I had a Country Omelet with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelet was uninspired. It had no flavor whatsoever. Thank God for ketchup! The red velvet pancakes were chocolate pancakes with red food dye added into them.  THey were brown on the outside & an odd shade of dark pink on the inside. They also were flavorless but they had some sickeningly sweet cream cheese flavored paste drizzled all over them. Then the stack was topped with whipped cream. Whipped cream? Really? Maybe that goes over well with children but for an adult its a little creepy. The accompanying dinner theater provided by other diners & the sweet tea were the highlights of the meal.The other strange thing about iHop is that the food never comes out hot!ref!2
I used to be in the industry and I know what my car does and does not need.  They couldn't seem to get that!ref!1

Back in Aug when I was out in Charlotte a co -worker took me to Alexander Michael's.  This place is a cute neighborhood gem.  I loved it!  It's removed from the main uptown area of Charlotte and it seems like this is the place where locals go.My dinner was awesome.  I ordered their blackend cat fish sandwich with fried pickles.  Yum!  Since!ref!4
In Charlotte for business and wanted some good local fair.  Fired up the Yelp and see Alexander Michael's getting awesome scores.  The map says 1.5 miles away and I don't have a car - going to have to hoof it.Show up about 7:30pm on a Wed.  Place wasn't crowded at all and I got sat right away.  The staff was nice.  I ordered the Fried Pickles as an appetizer.  Some people say they are too salty and I say!ref!4
As much as it was mentioned in every single tourist guide i could find of Charlotte!ref!4
A pretty good Morton's and your only option after the South Park location closed.  Located in the basement with lots of wood and leather.  Dinner in the bar area and the dining room a handful of times!ref!4
For the price I was incredibly disappointed. My steak (medium rare) was totally over cooked. Our waitress forgot to place one of our side dishes so it came out when we were nearly done. Our waitress didn't offer any type of modifications for one of our gluten free diners and completely forgot the extra plates we asked for. The only shining items from our meal were the mashed potatoes and wine.!ref!2

Came here with a friend for lunch and sat on the roof top deck. Aces for that! We started with the fried pickle. Love FP!ref!2
Ri Ra's is a good ol' fashioned Irish Pub. The most noticeable difference between it and a pub in Ireland is that it is a lot bigger than a pub in Ireland!ref!4

Ok but not fabulous-decor in room was bland.  Quiet with all the things a business traveler could want including business center where you can print out your boarding pass for free.  Great view of uptown and very comfortable beds.!ref!3
You had to pay $15 per day for Internet access.  The beds were uncomfortable.  The room keys did not work in the parking garage even though they claimed to fix them twice.  The bar us hideously overpriced.Want a sode in the middle of the night?  Gotta buy it from the gift store before it closes.  1 coke = $300.  I will NEVER be back.!ref!1

I had always heard good things about Mert's and was pleasantly surprised to see that they opened up at 9 a.m. on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch when most Charlotte restaurants don't open for brunch until 10 a.m.  I figured brunch would be a good introduction to Mert's and also allow us to try another brunch place that opened earlier.We were seated and received excellent service from our server.  Unfortunately!ref!3
I had a very nice brunch here the other day on a weekend trip to Charlotte. The food was very good but the service was ehh. The interior was interesting. I could have easily been in an Ikea on LSD. We ordered eggs over easy with country ham!ref!3
Hit up merts for dinner last night..  Had the Fried catfish and Beef rib combo.  Whole fried catfish was a little tough to negociate the bones and didnt not yeald much fish. \""The beef rib\"" was chopped up and in a small pile bones and all.  Like other have said the goodness in in the sides..  Mac and Cheese was real and had a nice crust on the top and the corn bread was good.. athough the piece my wife got looked like it was in the oven a littlel too long and dried out a bit.  Overall decent stop!ref!3
Mamma better slap me!ref!4
Mert's is one of those places you would see on Diners!ref!3
The food was alright and I thought that the portions were a good size. But i think that the service was absolutely terrible. My friend and I walked in and two women at the counter ignored us for a couple minutes!ref!2
I've eaten at Merts a few times and even received a free birthday meal which included a drink. Very impressed. My favorite dishes are the salmon cakes and the rice and beans with turkey sausage but that dish tends to be too salty at times. Overall!ref!4
Promised myself in the breakfast review I wrote in early July that I would go back for lunch.  Check!  Been twice for lunch now and each time walked away fully!ref!5
Thank you Yelp!  We were in town visiting and decided to try this place for lunch based on its good reviews.  Yelpers were right on - delicious (and affordable)!  We loved the cornbread!ref!5
My friend and I were driving from DC and finally made it to Charlotte. We've never been to Charlotte!ref!4
I liked the atmosphere but the food was WAY too salty.  Just didn't care for it.!ref!2
Had dinner last night here. The food left a lot to be desired. Reputation aside the salmon cakes had no seasoning and the ribeye was tough. Really disappointing. I've been here before when I come to Charlotte and had better food. Hopefully!ref!2
Delicious Southern food!The cornbread was so good. I got BBQ Beef Ribs!ref!4
Another big soul food spot downtown. If you are looking for chicken!ref!3
Not the best soul good I've ever eaten. My collard greens mixed with mustards? Were tough. The fried chicken was standard not anything to rave about. Salmon cakes were good. Mac n cheese can pass for soul food. Yams were great! Corn bread mediocre!ref!2
So it took three trips but I think I'm finally starting to become a fan of Merts.My first visit was to pick up some catering for an event and I didn't get a chance to try anything. The second visit was a bust I ordered the chicken wings!ref!3
Only went there during happy hour. There was a great drink selection!ref!3
Disappointing. My wife and I came here to celebrate her birthday!ref!3
I had a great meal with friends had drinks they had all we wanted! The staff was great not rude like the kings kitchen the food was great! thank you so very much! I shall keep coming back! Come here leave the kings kitchen food is great looks great staff out of this world!!ref!5
This place is a craphole. My friends and I have gone for a 2 AM breakfast a couple of times (I know that seems weird but it's cheaper than eating at the diner that caters the breakfast!) and the people working there are absolute dicks. The girl at the front door acts like she's the hottest thing since sliced bread. The girls that walk around are bit*hes unless you're throwing wads of money out. I jokingly told one of the girls that my friend wanted a lap dance and within 5 minutes he came back really mad. He said she danced and he handed her $30 and she said \""NO! It's $60!\""  That's crazy considering the girls don't even look very good! Maybe I'm biased because I'm not a strip club kind of guy but this place is a bad way to end a good night!ref!1
Even with the munchies at 2am this place is bad. I've eaten here and at the one in South End and both are a waste.  I usually just eat at the Pita Pit or risk a bacteria infection and eat from one of the street vendors(the chicken on a stick is might damn good!) by The Forum.!ref!2
Pizza is like art. Your dough acts as a canvas and your tomato sauce is like the paint... ok!ref!2
The two stars are for one thing.. The SLICE.  It is a descent piece of pie that would only be completely wonderful at 3am after a long night of drinking.  Other than that!ref!2
Ok im not going to say that i dont love coming here. The service is great!ref!4

I'll be honest- we only ate here because we were given a $100 gift card. This made a ridiculously expensive restaurant cost about as much as it would cost us on an average night out. We skipped drinks and dessert (we were really too full of other stuff anyway!) and our bill still came to $114 before tip. I was surprised that the dress code was so casual for such a nice place; my husband and I dressed up (hey!ref!4
The ambiance is deliciously dark and a throwback to the grand old days of quality tablecloths and real silverware.The service here was very sub-par.  Perhaps that was because I was dressed like an ignorant tourist that just wanted to be comfortable checking out the city---FYI--tourists have money to spend!ref!2
Wen't to Capital Grille for my birthday dinner. I hadn't been here since I was in High School. From what I remembered it was really good. Of course everything is a la carte. I ended up only having Lobster Mac and Cheese. (I'd already had a recovery meal after party #1) It was okay. Could have used a boost in flavor somewhere. Maybe some salt. My biggest concern was my drink. Is that bad? I'm concerned with my drink. Anyway!ref!3
The steak was cooked to perfection  .  Staff  is very friendly. Nice place to hang out.!ref!5

I have been here three times now. For some reason a lot of my coworkers really like it. It's a popular lunch-time destination. They are known for their southern!ref!2
It's a good ole southern home cooking joint on the west side. The biggest plus is the prices. Not many places still have dinner meal for less than $7 with 2 sides and a tea (their dinner specials come with tea). Food is typical.  Grilled pork chop is a little dry and tough. Better off with the fried pork chop. And when I said pork chop I meant super thin cut ones.  Country fried steak's gravy was the whitest I have ever seen... Thus a little bland.  It reminds me of comfort food people referring to when they talk about their grannies. Nothing against grannies (or moms)!ref!3
I like to refer to this place as.... The Key Shack! If you drive by!ref!4
I went in here when I had some time to kill while a watch was being fixed!ref!4
Don't eat anything but the chicken. Everything else is nasty. Charlotte should be a BBQ mecca!ref!2

I have to agree with Todd W. on this one...this place consistently shows \""winners\""...no joke...it seems like the majority of the movies that are shown here win some type of award! Oscars!ref!4
I went with my wife a couple of weeks ago.  We arrived not knowing what we wanted to see.  Noticed that Bridesmaids was scheduled at 9:25 and decided to see it even though it was only 8:50.  We walked around a bit in the shopping center across the street!ref!4

Very RUDE management- we had to wait over an HOUR to get our car out of valet while we watched people leave left and right...we mentioned this to several people - we were offered many excuses to find out in the end that they completely misplaced our CAR! I would have been satisfied if they had offered us a drink- our table spent over $200 on our dinner- we didn't even get an apology...I wrote a letter and everything!The waitstaff was friendly- the meal was ok - nothing special considering Charlotte has plenty of great restaurants . Restaurants have a lot to do with relationships- and they killed mine with this one.  Bottom line the food wasn't THAT good to warrant my return...!ref!2
They're trying so hard for swank. They really are. But they're failing. And it leaves me feeling blue. The bar is understaffed!ref!3
Reservation for 2 on a Saturday made with ease.  Maybe a warning sign. Valet parking was easy!ref!2

I went to Femme Fest at the Visulite and saw some great female performers. I really like the Visulite - with its cool but cozy interior. The only downside is that the floor is pretty tiny. I've stayed on the level just above the floor every time I've been there and ended up sitting at a table (and I'm normally a stand-right-by-the-stage concert-goer).I've also been impressed with the service at the bar each time I've gone. I guess I just expect to wait forever for a drink!ref!4
I've been going to the Visulite since it opened.  It's my favorite live music venue in Charlotte.  So many great bands have hit this stage.  Most of the staff have worked here since the beginning.  Great atmosphere.  Many wonderful memories!!ref!5
Great Indian restaurant!  It's like stepping across a few continents and tasting authentic Indian cuisine.  The \""naan\"" flat bread is piping hot when it comes to your table.  The garlic naan is my favorite.  And the curries are always wonderful.  If you haven't tried Indian food!ref!5
Terrible service! We were overcharged thanks to the waiters inability to split a bill - each couple on a separate tab - a normal thing to do in a restaurant - NOT HERE! They tally up the whole table and divide by the number of credit cards given and charge each one the same amount regardless of what each couple ordered. Do not make the mistake of going with friends and expecting the restaurant to be able to give separate tickets seems you have to sit across the room from each other and pretend not to know each other in order for that to be possible. Food was not what it used to be. Will remove this restaurant from our list of places to go.!ref!1

Good chinese takeout here!ref!2
Ho Ho Cherry House is my favorite Chinese. My criteria for picking Chinese consists of a crispiness factor - I usually get sesame chicken or General Tso's -and nothing is grosser then soggy chicken covered in thick sauce....This place does it just right - and its very very affordable (think very casual Chinese restaurant definitely not upscale!) - nice crispy/ light chicken complete with  pretty good although not super memorable side items such as fried rice and an egg roll. For me though!ref!5
This might be the worst Chinese I've ever tasted in my life...and i'm a college student so I've had a lot. I don't have a car so i ordered the sesame chicken and the beef with broccoli to go...two of my favorite standby dishes. the sesame was way too battered and was smothered with the sauce so much that i was literally scraping it off. it's really like eating fired dough with cherry jelly stuff...nasty. and the beef with broccoli was worse! it tasted like the \"" brown sauce\"" was day old gravy and the meat was like the mystery meat that you'd get at a middle school cafeteria. on second though i think my cafeteria was better. and the broccoli tasted acidic. it was just so gross id rather have just ordered pizza. seriously!ref!1

Decent food.  No desire to go back for a second try.  Salad was good but the fried chicken is very bland.

I LOVE this restaurant. So far!ref!5
I have been to this place plenty of times. I have always had good meals and service. But tonight was bad. I went ther with my wife's work friends. We sat at the bar tables and had a bartender named Bo(very red hair)   We had About 8 people and he insisted that if we sit at the tables we have to order food!ref!1
What a pleasant surprise!! The fried oysters are the best ever and so is the Diane! I had it with the crawfish and shrimp. Even the garden salad was good to be pretty simple! Definitely a great value! My family and I will be returning:)!ref!5
Had dinner here in the upstairs dining room near the live band.  The food was excellent and the portions were generous/filling.  The BBQ shrimp appetizer is tremendous.  An excellent way to start your meal.  The food is prepared well and in a timely manner.  I had blackened catfish with veggies (very well prepared and large portion) and thought it was phenomenal.  I thought the gumbo could be a bit better!ref!4
The Cajun Queen is a really nice neighborhood restaurant for me. The service is consistently good especially in the bar. I love the atmosphere and the live Dixieland jazz is a wonderful plus.What troubles me now and has troubled me from the first time I started going to the CQ : it seems like the kitchen believes everything must be really hot (spicy) since it's a Cajun restaurant. But some things just shouldn't be hot. Tonight I ordered the crawfish scampi appetizer. Scampi is generally shellfish flavored with garlic and herbs. Red pepper flakes are sometimes added but not as a predominant flavor. The CQ  added so much chili that it overpowered the crawfish. There is not a lot of difference between the scampi and etouffee which is supposed to be hot. If they would just not be so heavy-handed with the Cajun spices.....!ref!3
Interesting concept!ref!5
The fried oysters are to die for.The crayfish scampi looks great but a bit too garlicky.The BBQ shrimp is just a-ok.Real cool how they turned an old house into CQ.!ref!3
I have been in Charlotte for over three years and had never been to Cajun Queen!ref!2
The have some of the best ribs and rib tips in Charlotte. Tea and lemonade made fresh.!ref!5
Yes I love Burger King. Yes I know its terrible for me. No I will not stop coming here. I love this location!ref!3

All I have to say is Hayley is very talented. I had a great experience here!ref!5
Staying near the airport in Charlotte on a business trip!ref!3
This airport leaves a bit to be desired.  YES it is super busy!ref!3
The rocking chairs are genius!They're perfect for weary travelers that just want to relax especially those of us in between flights. Ahhh genius.And did I mention the food!ref!5
Free WiFi everywhere in the airport!Cute rocking chairs in the main lobby. A few small shops.Mostly fast food restaurants. The non-fast food restaurants are spread pretty far and wide. It's a pretty good hike between concourses but there are walking sidewalks in places. Overall!ref!3
Wonderful food and shopping available!ref!3
Busy and confusing. It's a nice and large open space filled with many escalators and walking escalators. The people are friendly and do try their best to help. Every terminal/section has a special desk where people who have missed their flights can go to rebook and/or get on standby flights. Unfortunately!ref!3
The airport is okay as far as large hub airports go. However!ref!3
Very nice airport if you have time to loiter before you flight.  Free Wi-Fi!ref!3
This would get such a good review if it weren't for a strong negative or two.Overall!ref!3
Had a layover here recently coming in from an international destination. Customs wasn't too bad!ref!2
Pretty efficient as far as airports go. Usually an hour preflight is good depending on where you're going. I generally fly us airways and have never encountered a problem with anything. Smooth lines for security and I recommend going through the d/e checkpoint as it almost always seems to be less congested and quicker than it's counterparts!  Happy flying :)!ref!3
First things first!ref!4
I would give this place a 3 if the organization of the parking lots/interior was better and if there wasn't someone standing in the bathroom making me uncomfortable when I have to go to the bathroom while I'm waiting for a flight.For the amount of air traffic that goes through this airport!ref!2
I had a connecting flight out of this airport from Austin to Indianapolis but due to weather delays and aircraft problem ended up spending more time here than necessary.  If it weren't for the free Wi-fi I would have lost my mind.My only real negative experience was with US Airways!ref!3
CLT is a pathetic airport for commuters who have to fly from smaller cities. The E concourse is getting further and furhter away from the gates to the flagship flights of US Airways. Half the time walking sidewalks are inoperable!ref!1
I was at this airport for a few mins as I connected. Would have liked to enjoy my supposedly one hour layover but my previous flight at LAX was delayed for no reason.!ref!3
@ Charlotte and ready for boarding!!!ref!2
I connected through CLT on a recent trip. I have to say!ref!2
I had a long layover at the Charlotte-Douglas airport going to and from New Orleans. I got to spend some time meandering around this airport.I like the layout - much more than other airports - and it's easy to get around from flight to food!ref!3
Like long lines and employees who LIE than CLT is the place for you. I was flying US airs and they are just as awful. This place is a joke and I will no longer be flying anywhere what would require using CLT. I had my husband 1 baby 1 4 yr old and my 70 yr old grandmother and they told me to go through the family line for security. I went through and this rude \""renta cop\"" said that the line was ONLY for employees!ref!1
Charlotte-Douglas Airport is pretty standard for those jetsetting or catching a connecting flight to the left coast. Don't be late!ref!4
CLT is a convenient airport despite being a rather busy hub!ref!4
As a North Carolina native now living in DC!ref!3
Basically the totally opposite of Newark Liberty Airport.Clean and well-lit. Friendly and courteous TSA members!ref!4
Huge airport.  Clean and lots of shopping.!ref!3
I fly into Charlotte a lot when I venture over to SC and I don't mind the lengthy layovers at DIA at all. Douglas International is a medium-sized airport. Your main form of transportation within the airport is a system of moving sidewalks!ref!3
One of the best US Airways hub airports.!ref!3
Decent selection and clearance pricing can be found at the Brooks Brothers store.  Once you're done shopping and still have some time to kill before catching your flight!ref!4
This is what a NYC airport should look like. It's chic and they have a wine bar!!! Why would a North Carolina airport have a chic wine bar. I thought i would land at a crappy run down airport like LaGuardia airport but to my surprise the south is more modern than NYC??? odd. NYC get with it!!!!!!!ref!4
Ugh!ref!3
Whenever I'm booking a flight that requires a connection (which!ref!4
I really really hate this airport. It is always a bitch flying in and out of it. Not to mention that 2 out of the 4 times I've flown through and had a connecting flight!ref!2
We were on our way back from a trip to Mexico and Cuba* when we arrived here for a short layover. This airport is easy to navigate!ref!3
They are in the middle of revamping the parking near the terminals.  Easy peasy airport.  The food options are lacking!ref!3
Decent airport!ref!4
It's an airport!ref!3
Actually this is one of my favorite airports. I like the fact that there are rocking chairs in all the terminals for use by weary passengers. The food selection in the main area is not bad as well as some of the offerings in the different terminals. Flights are usually pretty much on time unless there is a major thunderstorm passing through the area.I chose to travel on an airline other than USAIR!ref!4
Standard place that grew fast and has lots of spider webs.!ref!3
I have never been to an airport before where I would want to come back and just hang out. Get my nails done? Check! Superb southern food? Check! Legit shopping? Check and check!!ref!5
CLT used to be better!ref!3
Charlotte has grown I remember when the airport was small now it's like a little city of it's own. I don't mind waiting for a plane here as they have plenty of places to eat and pass time. They made it look real nice and \""purdee\"" inside so you feel like you're in a nice place unlike Newark or JFK which are boring as hell to me. I don't think the majority of passengers will be disappointed passing through here.!ref!4
I've been to so many airports over the years that I can't even name them all. In the morning!ref!2
Charlotte Douglas International Airport is a complete madhouse!ref!3
I really enjoyed my time here and the kids I brought song enjoyed it too! There are some planes that you can get inside of and volunteers to explain it all to you. The volunteers were so helpful! We were able to watch a plan take off from the airport. So cool! I really wish they had a restaurant for lunch. But other than that I really enjoyed the museum.!ref!4
Floyds on Nation Ford rd is terrible!!!! Worst collards and macoroni and whatever in the world. And space. Taste like noodles!ref!1
Went there 6 in the morning. It's just like any McDonald's!ref!4
I can't anymore. It's too busy here and service is not as fast as other Mickey D's with this kind of volume. Customers are rude too.!ref!1
We only went through the drive-thru and the service was pretty quick with not many cars to serve. My breakfast burritos had hard corners like were bad or cooked to long. They were also folded kind of weird!ref!3
Great selection and don't be fooled by the prices because they haggle and you can get a very competitive deal there. If you don't like to haggle then check out their website for their online deals. That is where you find the usual rock-bottom pricing for the firearms they carry. I'm like a kid in a candy store when I go to Hyatt's. It's located in the hood but don't let that stop you. Once inside you will feel very safe as every employee is carrying heat! Don't have a gun? Go there! Don't want a gun? Good!ref!5
If you didn't know where it was you'd miss it.  Dining area is sparse!ref!2
Went to see Joe Nichols last night and was disappointed in a few things.  First of all my friend and I went to the bar to get a drink and they don't accept credit cards!  What established bar/event venue doesn't accept credit?? Then the real problem arose... during the concert!ref!1
I came to Beauregard's for their mystery dinner theater on Saturday evening. I was surprised they offered something like this since the set-up was less than ideal. We were suppose to mingle around and interview the suspects!ref!2
Okay!ref!4
Driving up to the place!ref!5
Not too good and not that much flavor for what chicken can have.  The sauce is nothing special and as one reviewer said!ref!2

I had a gift card to this salon and was interested in trying it out. After much contemplation regarding which service to use my gift card on!ref!3
I was super wary about this stop because of previous reviews!ref!3
This place is truly hit and miss... The breakfast is best here like many other reviews say here the drive thru is rediculously laid out while I've never encountered rude staff here I gotta say it's only selling point is the location!ref!2
Harper's is like a more local version of TGIFridays or Applebees.  The food here is really delicious!ref!4
Really really really great place to eat.  Nothing is greasy!ref!5
Let me tell you gents this place is totes av (average). Really not much to say. If you like food you'll probably be able to eat some of it here. My friends at the table insist that I rate this place as \""good average\"" but that seems meaningless. Also $2 beers of which I've had about 6.!ref!2
This place is as bland as they get. The food was mediocre and the atmosphere was too.!ref!2
Typical BoA branch set up near South Park Mall.  It's located at the corner of Fairview and Barclay Downs so there is a traffic light to help you turn left and then into the parking lot.  Ample enough parking spaces and the building is shaped like a pie wedge so it makes for an interesting entrance (at the tip).A walk up ATM is located at the front for 24hr access as well as a drive thru ATM.  I've never seen anyone use the teller windows (drive through)!ref!3
Lived there for almost 3 years!ref!1
I gave up on Monterrey several yrs ago but was in the neighborhood today. I felt like Mexican for lunch. Clean!ref!4
So excited I made it back to an old staple. So!ref!4
I visit often.  Love the white salsa!ref!4
The food is better than average and affordably priced but service is extremely slow and there's no rhyme or reason as to when dishes come out of the kitchen.  They don't answer their phone any time of day and don't return calls so it's nearly impossible to make a reservation unless you happen to be willing to stop by before your dinner engagement.  But it's a nice small restaurant for impromptu sushi dinners for couples or a party of 3 or 4.  That's probably their focal point anyway.  They do have tatami mat seating and a fairly broad!ref!3
It seems a rarity to find a Japanese restaurant owned and operated by Japanese. Well Musashi is one such place. The menu is not the Americanized and that is worth three stars alone. Good authentic menu!ref!4
This restaurant seems actually run by Japanese people!ref!3
So this place comes highly recommended!! It is behind my favorite Thai/Vietnamese place (Viet-Thai) and once night we thought we'd check it out.We had a couple rolls of sushi and I had the Panko crusted Chicken and the boyfriend had the teriyaki chicken. Everything was good!ref!3
The worst apartment I've ever lived in! I've only been here 2 months and I'm miserable. If you are thinking of renting here DON'T! The apartment staff has been rude and have harasses us 5 times in 2 months! They have also entered out apartment on two separate occasions without our consent. If you are considering living here I highly encourage you to look elsewhere.!ref!1
Wow! A treat for your senses for sure! The moment you walk in you are greeted with colorful!ref!4

I'm a lunch patron because they're close to my workplace...When I go here!ref!4
Delicious Chinese food!  I had the Trio of shrimp!ref!5
First time I've been here in five years and it didn't disappoint! There wasn't a lot of traffic on a Saturday which I liked... but based on the food it should have been packed! The chicken lettuce wraps were pretty good! The rest dishes were savory and well prepared (had the Kung Pao chicken and crispy orange beef). You can get white or brown rice. The crispy beef was still crispy and the orange sauce had a little bit of a kick to it... just the way I like it. The service was nothing to write home about!ref!4
Wish it had been better when I made my one and only trip.  The menu was smallish and nothing quite appealed to me.  But I know others have enjoyed it very much!ref!3
My girl and I came here for their Sunday brunch to enjoy the seafood and hang out with new friends.  While the decor of the restaurant and the service was quite good!ref!2
I don't know if 1 star is right or 2!ref!1
Upstream has gone downhill!ref!2
Gave the restaurant a second shot - equally disappointed.  Bar service was slow!ref!1
Upstream is probably thought of as one of the best restaurants in Charlotte.  I am from Philadelphia where there are excellent restaurants with iron chefs so my viewpoint may be a bit skewed.   The food was good but not great or amazing.  Every dish (except the house salad) was over salted.  My husband had the tuna and I had the seabass. They were both very good but as I said before not great.  We would go there again but for sushi/raw items not necessarily the cooked menu items.  The salad was was the highlight for me (house salad) and the crab bisque was pretty tasty too.   Overall the service was very good but slow.  Our waiter was one of the most knowledgeable wait staff we have encountered since moving from PA.!ref!3
Thought we'd try Showmars; they are convenient. You place order at the counter and then find a table. Plenty tables available but every one was sticky. I don't consider a table top that holds on to you to be clean. Food was served quickly and is okay. Nothing slid off the table...!ref!3
A very ratchet place with a very ratchet staff.!ref!1
Well!ref!2
Ok I would give this place four stars!ref!3

Great idea!ref!3
Good food and drinks before going to a concert at the verizon wireless amphitheatre up the street. ~Cheers!ref!4
Great atmosphere and awesome beer selections. Wait staff was friendly. Food was mediocre unfortunately. The burgers came out well done. Waitress never even asked us how we wanted them cooked. This makes me believe the burger were previously frozen. The German potato salad had a big pool of oil at the bottom of the cup. Yes the German potato salad is made with oil!ref!3

Friendliest employees ever!ref!5
The other day someone posted a question about eating near the airport and Miguel's popped in my mind and ever since I posted my response!ref!5
So Miquel's is definitely a perfect definition for a \""Hole in the Wall\"" but let's be honest those places clearly have the best food. As a self proclaimed Mexican fanatic I was excited to see just what this place had to offer. We started with the chips and salsa and they were classic. The chips were warm and crispy and the salsa had just the right amount of kick! My friends and I ordered a little bit of everything...fajitas!ref!4
I really enjoy going to this place!!  It looks like a little hole in the wall but the food is great!  As well as the service!  It's close to my boyfriends work and that's how I found out about it!  Everyone he works with raves about their salsa!  And it is de-lish!  Every day they have lunch specials and it's very affordable.  They also have outside seating which is nice.!ref!4
Very basic deli. I work close so go here often. From the street this place doesn't look like much!ref!4
This is the first and only Showmars I've visited. There are about 20 of them in the Charlotte area. Food was pretty good. I'd give it one half step-up from a burger at a fast food joint.I had a Greek Salad; the salad (especially the chicken) was tasty but the dressing was \""totally bleh\"". Thankfully the default dressing was on the side so I asked for blue cheese dressing and it was much better -- they had Ken's dressing in a package.My dinner mates had a burger and fish and chips. All around \""OK\"". I'd not go out of my way to go again and certainly not worth a quest...!ref!2
I had the souvlaki and my husband had the sirloin tips. Both were completely flavorless. My husband and I both agreed that the most impressive thing about this place is that they could actually find a way to cook the flavor out of beef and onions.  The tzatziki sauce was okay same with the Greek salad.!ref!2
Hop Feng is a cash only Chinese carryout establishment. I thought my General Tso's Chicken was pretty good and the portion size was huge I actually was able to get close to 3 meals out of my lunch. For $7.50 I got the main dish!ref!3

ive heard nothing but good things about this restaurant from friends!ref!1

This is a NYC restaurant. That is a compliment and a complaint. There is no question the food is outstanding. Arguably the best in all of Charlotte and deserving of national acclaim. Here is my complaint. Have you ever dined somewhere that it spectacular and the place knows its spectacular? I have experienced this in NYC. Sort of like the honor is all mine and I should be grateful they have allowed me to dine there. Maybe it was just my experience!ref!3
Went here on a Thursday night at the last minute. We don't get to go out much so wanted to try someplace special. We were blown away by Barrington's and can't wait to go again. For our first course!ref!5

This UPS store shares its main entrance with the Caribou Coffee. They are a full service mailing shop!ref!3
Everything really is a dollar (though some things are two for a dollar). I thought I might take a browse and see what there was and I was amazed. I somehow managed to pick up $7 worth of stuff that I actually needed for my place. Stuff that would have been twice or three times the price at the local Wal-Mart.If you're looking to save a few bucks!ref!3
This is a very busy dollar store. No matter what time I go in there is always a line at the cashiers station. This location has a good variety of merchandise!ref!3
Sigh...to be honest!ref!3
You would think fried chicken would be simple... Absolutely horrible.  A night visit only added insult to injury. 3 waitresses and still had to return one drink for lack of alcohol. If you want to shoot pool!ref!2
Today was only my second visit to this location. My family just moved to Charlotte in June and frequented the location where we used to live. First visit was great!ref!2
Very good food and I like the atmosphere and style. Maybe it is a little 80'ish looking on the design!ref!4
We eat at trio nearly twice a week. The menu has various different items and everything is good. I love the homemade chicken fingers and their brick oven pizzas are to die for. Trio is also very inexpensive for the quality of food that you get. Most dishes are under 12.00. The service is good as well.!ref!5
Casual dinner with members tonight and food was great! Service was inexperienced.  Always love the location and people!!ref!3
Kabuto is your run-of-the-mill Japanese Steakhouse. Different stations with chefs slinging shrimp tails around the communal dining areas like it's a lunchtime magic show. Always a plethora of laughs and gags going around the group. This place is great for lunch. $9 and 30 minutes and you're out the door. Uhhh...If I'm craving a salad with ginger dressing!ref!3
Well it's not the place it use to be. We went there for my birthday per the kids request and we had the typical experience which was a lot of banging!ref!2
Not my favorite experience at a Japanese Steakhouse. My food was good-- not phenomenal!ref!3

Our choice and the choice of our son's family when we want Indian food in Charlotte.Excellent food covering all the Indian traditionals such as tandoori!ref!4
Extremely dissapointing trip here. Service was average to bad. Food quality left a lot to be improved. Currys have no meat but curry. Taste wise it isn't great either. I make far better indian food at home. Meat was not cooked properly and was very chewy. Overall I don't recommend it and won't be going back at all. Oh yeah their carpets were dirty with food everywhere!ref!2

Good place to go if you are in a bind for some sporting goods.  Pretty have a little bit of everything... but \""jack of all traits.... master of none\"" applies here.

There are a couple of Dick's stores that have a better selection in running shoes (Southpark) and are deemed \""shoe specialty locations\!ref!3

We went on a Friday night as packed as it looked we actually went right in and got a table. The waitress was good and always on point with service. As for the food I ordered the Jack Daniels ribs and shrimp. The shrimp were really good. As for the ribs they showed you shouldn't order ribs unless its a BBQ place. They were suppose to be baby backs but they were dry. Some parts of it were pretty good but a majority of it left your mouth dry wanting water. My wife ordered the steak!ref!2

Terrible \""hostess\"" experience. Woman at the front had a terrible attitude as soon as I walked on. The store is basically empty and I've been waiting for 40mins when I was told my wait time would be 15mins.Add On: This is my fourth time coming back due to inventory and no fault of the stores. I'm continued to be so disappointed by the \""hostess\"". They really act like you're an inconvenience. Will probably be my last trip and just drive an hour and a half to go to my home store. Really disappointed. This is not the experience I'm accustomed to receiving from verizon.!ref!1
I liked it bc of the coupons but it is now closed they informed me by email.!ref!3
This is a decent hotel.  I'm not sure what the real rate is but its definitely a good deal at the corporate rate I got.  It reminds of me a courtyard in many ways.  Its clean and has a standard hotel feel.The staff was really friendly.  AND I really liked how they automatically enrolled me in their hotel points program.   Not sure I'm staying here again as I'm already a member of another program....but it never hurts to pick up more points.Free Wifi and HBO in the rooms is a plus as well.  It located near some restaurants in walking distance and its off the main road which helps with the noise.!ref!3

So we decided to celebrate our son's excellent grades with a dinner out. Mac Grille seemed a nicer choice than others so we stopped by. We made sure to get there early to avoid the crowds.  The problem was that Mac Grille seems to schedule wait staff very thinly at the beginning of the evening. So our waitress was the hostess! She didn't know much past where to seat us but gave her all in the attempt until the overloaded waitress stopped by to take over.  Despite it!ref!3

I give this place zero stars.  I went in for a pedicure and not only did I wait for about 10 minutes (with my feet in the water) for the girl to finish eating her lunch!ref!1
I don't even have the words!  Don't even have an app to order if you send an update that the food is out for delivery but I have to call every 20 min wondering where it is!ref!1
Our original intention was to go to Texas Land and Cattle!ref!3

This has been a great experience for my kids. Sean and his staff are amazing. Can't say enough about his teaching and ability to relate to younger kids.!ref!5
I made it to the top- that's all that matters!Love this place.!ref!4
This is for the Indian Trail location!ref!3
Just had a GREaT experience here... I was yelled at!ref!4
Don't you love it when you have to beg the restaurant to put food out on a buffet? Whenever I go here!ref!2
We were originally going to cook Friday night!ref!3
So the big question since we moved down to Charlotte has been!ref!3
I was down in Charlotte on business for five days and I ate here four of those days for lunch.  NEED I SAY MORE?!ref!4
Great lunch spot. To repeat other reviews!ref!4
4 stars for the service!ref!3
Not good! Really!ref!1
Bojangles has always been our favorite \""greasy spoon\"" for the occasional weekend breakfast when we are feeling too lazy to cook.  Unfortunately!ref!1
I hadn't had Papa John's for at least a year.  It's one of the better chain pizza places!ref!3
Two words.  Dirty and nasty. Better off driving 3 miles to the Steele creek McDonalds!!ref!1
My friends and I always meet up here when I am visiting from out of town. The service is usually mediocre but last night was absolutely terrible. One of my friends got there first and a soon a he sat down at the table in the bar area he was presented by the blonde female bartender with a $150.00 tab. He politely told the girl this wasn't his tab and she proceeded to literally scream at him and fly off the handle.  Luckily the tab owners had just stepped outside for a moment!ref!2
I've only been here once!ref!1
Location is perfect view to the lake but services pretty slow!ref!2
Great little place just across the border.  Food is always great as well as service.!ref!4
Food was very good. I had the Reuben sandwich. My only suggestion is that the waitress should check back more often to see if we need anything. Otherwise!ref!4
The library is a nice!ref!3
Any place that's located on a lake for a fish fry is alright with me.. It's packed on Friday which means you get to have a few cocktails while waiting for a table!ref!5
What could I possibly say about the Beach House Restaurant and Lounge?  I guess I could think of a few things.I went there today for the first time and was dazzled by the charm it flaunted!ref!5
For being surrounded by two lakes!ref!4
This place has good steaks!ref!4
We had dinner at the Beach House on Friday on our way up to northern Wisconsin based on reviews on Yelp.  If you are looking for good fish fry the Beach House has it.  I had the perch which was great!ref!3
I took my mom and grandma to the Beach House last night for dinner thinking it would be better than getting a Papa Murphy's pizza. There weren't many patrons in the dining room. Our waitress was very short with us!ref!1
Three stars = A-OK.  It was fine.  It wasn't great.  This place has been here for about 30 years.  Before that it was a car wash.  I always think of it as the place that used to be a carwash.Anyway.  Went with a group of 15.  Mom was buying and we got the \""Classic\"" banquet (the cheapest one).  It was more food than we could eat.  The food was fine.  Not awesome.  The best flavor was hoisin sauce and!ref!3
This was!ref!1
Decent food!ref!3
The short of the story is - we went here yesterday (Mother's Day) and were there 3 hours! Waited a full 2 hours for our food. So if you have don't mind waiting an unbelievable amount of time for food and have all day to waste!ref!2
Absolutely THE worst!  This place won \""Best of Madison\"" for Chinese food for how many years??? The judge must have been completely stoned out of his mind! Customer service:  Very poor.  The server never checked back until I went looking for her!ref!1
Ate here once with a buy one!ref!1
From scratch pastries!ref!4

This review of the Madison Marriott West focuses on the group event services of this facility and not the guest rooms.  I recently attended an evening Board meeting and a one-day conference at this hotel.The majority of the sales and catering staff at the Marriott were wonderful to work with.  This was the first time we hosted at event at this location.  The responsiveness of the staff was superb in setting up the event.  There were proactive in keeping our group on track with logistical issues leading up to the event.  On the day of the event!ref!3

The scene reminds me of...a garage.  A garage with fairly rude servers and overstuffed patrons with nothing to say.  We waited ... And waited.  The menu had the basics- no problem there.  We waited. Oh!ref!2
First we waited 20 minutes which was ok with us but then we waited 45 minutes for our two items to show up that too incomplete. As one of the reviewers mentioned the breakfast was very oily. Taste was just ok. Won't be going back.!ref!2
Told them to replace my belt tensioner due to frequent squeaking after replacing my belt.. They looked around and said!ref!5
Recently rented speakers and microphones for an event and was very pleased with the service and quality. I emailed Full Compass!ref!5
Hard to pass up the Road Kill Burrito.  Ask for the bucket of sauces.It was as good as when I tried it ten years ago as it was last week.I don't think much has changed around here in 30 years!ref!4
Go soft and juicy burgers!  I dream and crave these burgers.  Basic cheese burger with pickles and they special mustard.!ref!5
Delicious pork sandwich with coleslaw and very attentive service at modest prices in a rustic atmosphere!ref!3

Great food!ref!4
The wait staff were non-existent!ref!1
Update: 8/26/128:30 A.M. Hangover. Ordered 2 Whoppers w/o cheese and 1 Whopper w/ cheese and 1 order of onion rings. Drive-thru. Had to pull ahead and wait. 21 minutes later!ref!1

Love everything about this place! My family has been ordering carry out from here for at least 10 years. It's the best Chinese on this side of town. The lo mein rocks!!ref!5
Way too sweet for my liking. Real authentic Chinese food isn't always sweet. In my opinion!ref!2
Corp store on Lien rd was not a good choice.  The manager of the store was very unhelpful and gave me the run around about trying to fix my phone. If you want good service with people who actually care!ref!1

Visited last Saturday evening and nothing was \""good\"".  Drinks were sub-par and no!ref!2
terrible selection of shoes and jeans!ref!1
I've been here for shows many times through the years.  The venue is small!ref!4
Worst security at any venue I have ever experienced and way overpriced drinks. $9 for a double? Fuck that noise. Security goes through literally all of your stuff at the door!ref!1
Does anyone in Madison consider this a great Mexican food location? Both of my experiences at Pedro's have left me disheartened. They go a little something like this:1. Thursday night. Friends invite me for inexpensive margaritas. Am   approached by a girl who wants me to go out with her father standing 10 feet away!ref!1
Opinions are a changing.  Went to Pedros over the weekend.  Tamales were not good.  The sauce had formed a skin on the top because it sat under the heat lamps too long.  I took three bites before I found any pork.  I ate half of one and the waiter asked if I wanted to take the rest home.  When I said no!ref!2
I hadn't been to Pedro's in years!ref!3
We called to confirm price AND went online for estimates. The dispatcher told us it would be less than $15. We got to our destination the clock said 10.50 but they said they had to charge us an additional $12! He blamed it on a new dispatcher. Sorry that is not our problem. We will choose another company next time.!ref!1
Grade: CChain food. Okay service. I can't explain why I don't hate this place.!ref!3
It's a national chain so you pretty much get what you'd expect. I have never had problems with the service and the food is always good.!ref!4
A wash may be better priced than others but you'll get what you pay for. My husband brought out 2008 Prius for a wash and vacuum and it doesn't look like anything has been cleaned! The carpet in the hatch and floors are still dirty and none of the interior was wiped down. We will be going to Octopus or we'll just do it ourselves next time.!ref!1
It took them two washes and a visit with the owner to get it partially right.The owner thinks the only way to dry windows and windshields is with a wet cloth.I couldn't convince the owner of using dry cloths.I won't go back - The guy is brusque!ref!1
OUTSTANDING IN EVERY WAY. Darlene is the owner and #1 World Champion Queen of the Alteration Universe. I really cannot say enough good things about her. Her friendliness!ref!5

Neighborhood delivery and takeout great....certainly a step higher than the other chains in this level.They don't biast 30!ref!4
Friendly staff and quick service but!ref!2
The food can be good here (not great but good) but the biggest problem for me is the AWFUL service.  Somebody teach these people some customer service.  I swear that the guy who waited on me the last time I was there was high.  The interminable waiting for refills on drinks and the check drove my blood pressure through the roof.I've determined that the secret to getting good service from anyone here is to be a hot looking college girl...  that seemed to keep the waiter's attention focused on the table next to mine...  Maybe she was one of the more positive posters here.!ref!2
I was disappointed with my experience!ref!3
If I could give this place 10 stars I would. I've been coming here since opened and it is consistently the best. Breakfast all day!ref!5
I like Monty's food--breakfast!ref!3
I've been coming here since I was in middle school and it was the cool place to hang out on half-days. 6 orders of waffle fries!ref!3
Yucky greasy food.!ref!1
Sweet potato hash is fantastic!  The tofu scramble has a bit of a spicy kick and is a great option for vegans.  In fact!ref!4
What an eclectic menu for a diner!  The ambiance is just what you would expect from a classic 60's diner.  I had a ruben and some fries and it was really good!  Most places use processed corned beef.  Theirs was real sliced beef...very tender and very flavorful.  Probably the best ruben I have ever had.  I had to try the pie too since they tease you with a great display right when you walk in.  The French silk was really rich and chocolaty.  Definately worth the stop if you are in the area or passing through.!ref!4
Craving a chocolate malt!ref!4
Amazing is all I can say. They have absolutely everything. No!ref!4
This was our first B&B expierence and it was amazing! We stayed here June 2012 for a birthday weekend. The owners made us feel very special and right at home. Our room!ref!5

Now this is what I'm talking about!!  Total hole in the wall on East Wash in a strip mall behind some Mexican buffet!ref!4
I love their thin crust pizza but I always feel a little ripped off which keeps me from ordering from them often.  They charge a steep delivery fee which if not taken form the tip makes a pizza almost 28 bucks.  Other places around here have bullshit delivery fees (along with bitchy statements about not taking the fee out of your tip!ref!3
I was in town for the weekend with my son (13) and his friend. asked the front desk at my hotel if there was any good Chicago style pizza places in Madison. I was directed to rosati's. such a disappointment. very bland & the crust...just no. the teenagers even thought it was mediocre. we each tried a slice!ref!1
N E W   S E A T S !!!!  The old bench were terrible and kept us away.  We spent two games this year and we are hooked.!ref!5
Had a lot of fun at a Mallards game recently.  Food and beer are top-notch in both prices and quality.  Front-row seats along the basepaths are a bit narrow and claustrophobic; it seems like they sacrificed about 3-4 inches of legroom compared to other rows.  People were friendly!ref!4
Really beautiful place. Must go see - herb garden - TOUCH N FEEL was really good. Otherwise really big place and definitely can cater to an event. Thai Garden was also good.!ref!5
Pretty impressive landscaping!ref!4
Grease running down my hand. That's a first. Maybe that's appealing to some people!ref!1
The decor was ok. Nothing special but there were some odd mylar stars and hot air balloons hanging from the ceilingCame in for dinner and there are two other tables at 8:00 on a Thursday night.  I wonder if people go to bed early around this neighborhood or if this place just isn't that popular.Coconut soup was weird .  A mix of hot coconut milk that's been watered down and then laden with sweetened baking coconut from a bag.  This was definitely not fresh coconut in any way and I found this soup to be disapointing.   Lamb Saag was about as much lamb as you might expect for a dish costing 12.95. It's uniform liquidey sludge was a little too reminiscent of diarrhea for me and I lost a little of my appetite!ref!1
DO NOT EAT HERE.  They changed my tip and charged me $28 for lunch.  Absolutely ridiculous.!ref!1
I read the new ass't governor gave a speech there invoking God.  Please!ref!1

Giving this place two stars is a stretch!ref!2
As much as I love the idea of saving a poor helpless animal from being put to death this place could use some work if they intend to adopt animals out! First and foremost the customer service here is terrible. My parents have visited the shelter on more than one occasion to view the dogs ready for adoption and have yet to be greeted with a friendly helping hand. If they had they would have a dog right now. Its hard to enquire about a dog when no one or information is available regarding the dog. In addition I believe adoption fees ranging from $175.00 to $350.00 are a bit much especially considering the funding the Dane County Humane Society receives.  Perhaps they should consider arranging discounted fees with vet services they use.  I understand it does cost a great deal of money to home an animal which should be taken into consideration by the adoptee however you shouldnt have to spend hundreds to get a dog. I mean considering they put thousands of dogs to sleep each year!!! Nonetheless if you can rescue a animal from here...There is no greater gift than the gift of life!!ref!3
Mediocre sushi!ref!3
Well made sushi!ref!4
Great bread!  But I wish the sandwiches were a little bigger.  I got the wheat sub roll with meal deal and it disappeared too quickly...left me hungry!  I guess I'll try the french bread next time.  Maybe it's a little bigger.!ref!2
We've been to Boomerangs on several occasions now. Their wing night on Wednesdays can't be beat. Their sauces are really good. I actually prefer a lot of their sauces over that big-chain wing place (which I won't name). The wings are really big and only 33 cents. I like that you can get as many of any flavor as your want without an extra charge. My favorite sauces are the jerk and tequila lime.Their sides and burgers are really good!ref!5
ok!ref!3
Dr. Curt Thurman is my hero.I trust Curt with my pets completely.  He is absolutely wonderful with the animals and treats them with as much care and compassion as if they were his own.  He explains everything and the reasons for it; never have I felt in the dark about what was going on.  Our dog has had some pretty serious health problems as she's gotten older!ref!5
General Tso's Chicken is one of my favorite dishes!ref!5
Wonderful bake-it yourself pizza.  My friend and I always get the vegetarian and it comes loaded with all the usual veggies and ample cheese.  There's a gourmet vegetarian option with artichoke hearts and spinach that's great as well.  They have good fresh salads and cookie dough for sale also.  Service went downhill there for awhile-they had some downright sullen people in there who used to get upset with us if we came in a half hour before closing!ref!5
Stopped here on our way back form Florida... not much to choose from out here...I tried the shrimp & grits.. AWESOME!!!!  Never thought  this would be a good combo but it works here!! And try the crustless coconut cream pie... MMMM!!!good attentive service.!ref!4
Farm and Fleet is perfect for finding items like spark plugs!ref!5
soooo!ref!1
I get my hair cut at these types of places and i rotate all the time. There is a guy here - mildly creepy and blatently prompting you for gossip. I'm sure he and so many other stylists get a ton of it but i could tell he was prompting me for it. No thanks. When i want to put people on blast i'll do it myself.!ref!2
Went here after a doctors appointment one day. The pizza was good. The small salad wasn't their best. The service sucked. The waitress didn't give us refills and nothing was clean. She gave us our check but never came back to take our money. My husband almost walked out after being ignored at the desk by many waitresses that still wouldn't take our money. Finally!ref!2

My first (and last) experience with Rick's was an interesting experience.  I am new to Champaign and called to schedule my BMW for repair to what I believed was a caliper problem.  I was told to have my tires checked first at the place where I bought them.

I was again told to have my tires checked!ref!1

I love olive garden!ref!3
I'm not the hugest fan of Indian food but if I had to eat it this is where I would go. They also have a few other dishes besides Indian which is nice. The food tends to be spicey and pretty authentic!  A lot of what they offer is geared toward the vegetarian crowd.!ref!3
Aw!ref!4

The Merry-Ann's at Neil and Kirby is a standby.  I use to live near there and my neighbor and I would go there every Sunday morning.  The regular waitress was awesome and knew what we wanted.  It is the typical greasy spoon and I love it for that.  Got the t-shirt.  I've moved and have yet to find that certain place that gives me the warm fuzzy feeling that a omelette or diner's stack from Merry-Ann's can provide.  Forget your calorie-counting conscience at the door.I think the one downtown is okay!ref!4

I got Sam's French Toast with a side of eggs and the eggs were fine but the french toast mostly tasted of everything else that was on the grill. I think if there were separate grills for meat vs other items it would've been better. Friendly service though.!ref!2
I always look for a nice pub when visiting different cities. I saw this while walking on campus and decided to check it out.... Staff not friendly or sociable... Maybe it's because Im from the south and use to hospitality ....but damn how about a smile and a conversation I WAS ONLY PERSON at the bar.. I even tried to get a convo going... I know my opinion isn't going to close the bar but as a former bartender who OWNs a company now .... Customer Service is what will make you $$$.!ref!2
This breakfast spot had big shoes to fill. The Le Peep up near Northwestern was one of my favorites. The menu was a bit pared down compared to its northern counterpart!ref!3

Their Kobe burger with cheddar cheese!ref!5
I really don't get what the big deal is with this place.  I have had friends tell me thats they have some of the best burgers out there!ref!2
Seriously. Best burgers in town. The black burger is BOMB! Without that cajun remoulade!ref!5
I heard that this restaurant is closing soon. So my coworkers and I went to try it out. Their lunch menu has excellent selections. You can either go with their entrees or there's an option to choose 2 or 3 of their entrees in a single dish. The service is exceptional as well. Definitely one of Champaign's best.!ref!4
I used to LOVE the Great Impasta.  It was my restaurant of choice.  If there was a night out to be had!ref!1
Update - finally went to the new Lincoln Square Mall location. The decor is just awful!ref!2
I've had good luck selling stuff here!ref!3
fun place to stop for a treat if you're trecking across campus.  perfectly located just off the quad on wright st.  pretty good flavor and rather fresh.  they stopped making my favorite  piece in their collection; the earl grey truffle!ref!4
I probably would have given moonstruck threeish stars when it was open!ref!1
You were overpriced and full of yourself (Really!ref!3
This place is only good for picking up dumb underage girls.  Not worth it.!ref!1
I must admit that I'm a little older and biased against the college bar scene. If I was in my early 20's!ref!2
Why did I come here: It was close by which is a plus for a student who lives in Campustown and wants to support something local.They are open at good hours and I have never had a problem with getting an appointment. For a GUYS haircut!ref!4

The service is rude here. They are impersonal and impolite. The food is ok!ref!2

Um....Nope! This place is in DESPERATE need of John Taffer. Bar Rescue is needed. (even though they are busy on the weekends- it saddens me that they could be making SOOO much more money. Cleanliness- NONE! I get the peanut shells on the floor!ref!1
Excellent pizza (full disclosure: I was a cook here) and decent beer selection. The pool tables make it difficult to socialize at time!ref!4

I am from Dallas and in Champaign for business.  I looked at Yelp for suggestions on good places to eat and Bacaro seemed to be the place to go.  I thought it was great.  Unique tasty dishes!!ref!5
Bacaro's cuisine is innovative and delicious! Appropriate proportions are creatively presented. Ingredients are always fresh and the specials take advantage of what's in season!ref!5
I had Saturday brunch here this week and was terribly disappointed.  In the past its Radio Maria has been nothing but fantastic!ref!3
Awful place. If you are trying to go there for good drinks this is an OK place to go to but the food was horrible. The tapas ceviche was $10 which came with 4 shrimp and was topped with popcorn (I have no idea why). If they were trying to go for fun and innovative food this place completely missed the mark. The potatoes and chorizo came in an extremely small portions and where bland. Not to mention the paella which was $25 and the rice was not well cooked. This place takes small portions to a new level. Overall I left that place with $80 less and still hungry. Not worth the money and the food was a complete disappointment. The only reason this place is getting two stars is because of their drinks.!ref!2
I love this place.  My friends and I try to have a 'girl's night out' once a month and we frequent Radio Maria because of the delicious cuisine and the atmosphere.  It is relaxing and has several conversation pieces.  The service is spectacular.  This is one of my favorite local spots to dine in Champaign!ref!4
By far our favorite spot we've eaten at so far in Champaign. Our server was a little strange - definitely new to the job - but the food was excellent and the service was completely reasonable. Very large beer selection as well. Highly recommend - we'll be back!!!ref!5
Some of the best cocktails in town. Only downside is some bartenders make them better than others. Love the mojitos! Reasonable prices. Nice decor. Nice crowd. Nice music. I went for brunch and had a lobster omelette.. I found it had a bit too many different flavors for my taste!ref!3
Wonderful hummus and everything else!ref!5
Blah. Stayed here over Illinois Homecoming weekend!ref!2

Time has passed this place by. I used to crave stopping here every time I was back in town. This visit!ref!2
simply fantastic!ref!4
Seasonal place that is always a favorite. A bit off campus but worth the drive.Take your friends here when it's hot and you'll be guaranteed thanks all night.!ref!4
Absurd wait time. We waited in a line of ~15 people for 45 minutes. I timed the group in front of us (5 orders). It took the cashier 11 minutes to put together five scoops of friggin' ice cream. No business this inefficient should be around. But obviously the ice cream is good.!ref!1
Who doesn't love lemon custard?  So refreshing!  And really great in a lemon chiffon snowstorm.  The only negative is the long lines - but still worth it!!ref!4
Pizza is great if you enjoy thin crust. Other menu items are good as well.  The service consistently sucks!  It's horrible!  Every time!ref!1
One of the more \""adult friendly\"" mini-golf courses around. I disagree with other reviewers that the course is easy - I think it's rather challenging. Mostly because of small hills!ref!4
The pizza wasn't horrible!ref!2
Very nice place.  Good atmosphere.  We were stuck at ADEd across the street for a conference and lunch was \""on you own\"".  Saw this on YELP and gave it a try.  Nice place!ref!4
Situated between Amsterdam (a gay club the girls wanted to hit up!ref!3
The Wild Thaiger is one of my new favorite places.  Every dish I've tried as been excellent.  They accomodated with some grace a friend with food allergies and were polite -- too polite -- in serving me as I (unknowingly) arrived just at closing.  The peanut sauce on the satay is amazing.  Pad Thai is a standby at a Thai place!ref!4
I had high hopes for this restaurant.  It was a 30 minute drive from Laveen!ref!3
The food here is absolutely delicious! I would highly recommend their thai green curry (has a nice spicy kick to it)!ref!4
Ive only been here once for dinner but I go alot for lunch!ref!4

Wow. I have been going to this practice for 3-4 years. I have had some troubles with them in the past but this is the kicker of them all.

Her response was!ref!1
Safeway's are great now..  they have re doen the insides and put in a nice deli type place... they offer pre-made salads that are actually good!ref!4
I called and orders three sandwich platters and a veggie platter for pick up the day before I needed them. I show up and no sandwiches! No order! Nothing! They also wrote pick up time wrong on another order so us two customers were fighting to get our orders made first. On top of it all customer service was rude. Bad experience all around! The only reason for the two stars is for the poor deli staff working furiously to make 100 sandwiches in no time flat.!ref!2
I have to search long and hard for things in this store that don't expire the day I'm purchasing them. They don't have a lot of the things they offer in their weekly ad!ref!1

This place is your basic sports bar.  Lots of TVs all tuned to sports.  The outdoor seating is on the sidewalk and facing East so you'll never get any direct sun.My hamburger was TERRIBLE but the shoestring fries were great.  My girl Jacqui liked her entree.!ref!2
I'm not really fond of writing sub par reviews. I really covet being wowed!ref!1

A little pricey for the lack of amenities but the history of the hotel made it worth one night stay. Tiny room.Simple bathroom.Did have a bar with food open late so that was great. I didn't get to their pool but heard it was nice.Room seemed clean to me.Great location! Walking distance to everything downtown.Beware! I was quoted one price on the phone but when I went to use the yelp promo they bumped it $10 bucks. Not Cool!!ref!3

I am an avid Mexican Food Eater so this restaurant honestly caught me off guard a little bit and I have dined here twice!ref!3
Stopped at this place on the way to PHX airport.  Looked like a local joint but got inside and realized it is probably a chain.  The salsa is accessible and acceptable.  I got my tacos to go.  No lengua or barbacoa and that clued me in that it must be a chain and sanitized to some degree.  Plus the fact that some non-hispanics were working behind the counter.  Got the airport and looked at the tacos and realized that the chicken was overcooked and the chunks too large for a taco.  Anyway!ref!2
Best teriyaki chicken in town!Not sure what it is about the teriyaki sauce but it's perfect! The chicken is always tender and I've never had a bite with fat on it. Even the side salad is great!ref!5

As a tourist we stopped here before leaving the Phoenix area. It had great parking garage above the Restaurant and was told by someone that it would be validated. Turned out the Restaurant only validates half of if. Ugggh. Went in side!ref!3
I have been going to the Matador since I was in grade school. They have consistently good no-frills Mexican food and I much prefer it over the chain locations that are around. It's a nice large location downtown and has been renovated since many of the reviews on here were posted. Yes!ref!5
Pretty good food. Pop in here for a quick lunch or a quick dinner. I wouldn't plan on coming here for a nice dinner while on vacation!ref!3
So this first experience started off with a huge cockroach in the bathroom. Almost couldn't even sit down to go. (yuck) ok on to the rest. The chips and salsa were good with a little bit of spice. The Numero 15 is a cheese enchilada with a chicken taco rice and beans. The only flavor at this restaurant was in the salsa. It was so bland. I don't know that it was worth the $3 parking validation we came for. My friend and I love Mexican so we picked it on our way elsewhere!ref!1
I had the fish taco platter.  It was good and had both green and purple cabbage.  The tacos came with white rice and black beans (which I love).  I found the salsa hotter than I expected.  The tea was fresh and cold.  The only thing I would have improved is to have more flavorful fish.  It was a bit bland.  Overall an A-OK place to eat.!ref!3
(Let me preface this review by saying that!ref!4
It was OK. A Mexican restaurant without con queso is crazy! Food was average at best. Service was good and the strawberry margarita was good but the food was not impressive.!ref!2

The Old Spaghetti Factory has such a fun atmosphere.  We've gone twice and both times were sat in these booths that were like little rooms.  I loved it!  It's a really great place for kids!ref!4
I have been going off and on to this place since i was a kid!I went last weekend and i think more than anything i just LOVE the place it's self. The food is hit or miss and they took eggplant off the menu and i do have to say that was my favorite thing to get there. But the building is so beautiful and inside is so many eye catching things to look at. and they have a trolley inside as well!ref!3
3 stars is sufficient..... I feel the prices are on the high side...Yes!ref!3
I come here about 4 or 5 times a year. It's consistently good. There is ample seating!ref!4
omg. sitting in the bar because they had no seating in main diningroom.  menus flung onto the table!ref!1

I found this place by accident. Blink and you'll miss it. Best fried catfish I've had. Totally not greasy. Thin cornmeal batter is the right amount of crispy. Fish is tender and moist inside without being greasy at all. Coleslaw was pretty decent. Cornbread was soft and had a hint of sweetness but not too much. Portions are good. Vegetarian options for the non-meat eater. I ate well for less than $10!ref!4

My very first review - my dark blue car ruined on the exterior.  Couldn't see it until I returned home and the sunlight revealed exterior body scratches.  Evidently they didn't take care to use clean rags/towels.  Looks like a Brillo pad was used.  Going back tomorrow to see if we can get this rectified.Well!ref!1
They also messed with my side mirror and gave me a huge blind spot which I didn't notice until driving!!ref!3

Went here for dinner last night for the first time. The desserts and packaged foods looked DELICIOUS. I am picky about meat (like I don't like biting into tendons and things I don't want to eat) so the chicken kabobs were a little iffy (I bit into things I didn't want to eat)!ref!3

The landscaping and maintenance are well done.  I walk down here at lunch to detox and revitalize myself for the afternoon.  I don't see a whole lot of stores that would draw me in on a regular basis though.  I am hopeful this place will see a Renaissance and draw in more interesting shops ala The Union at the Biltmore.!ref!3
On vacation and this place was across the street. The guy who helped me was very nice. He carried on conversation and reccommeded places I should try in the area while visiting. I wish I knew his name to put on here. He spoke english and lived in North Carolina at one time. Anway!ref!5
I come here for lunch often. They have good lunch prices on sushi and rice/noodle bowls. The staff is always friendly. You can eat in or carry out. I usually get the lunch spicy tuna roll. It is delicious and cheap! Their miso soup is pretty good. I've never tried the bowls because I know I would go into a food coma after lunch!ref!4
Big  Thank you to Honey Bears to start off!ref!3
This is really one of the more disappointing BBQ places in Phx.  I hate to disrespect Honey Bears but their pulled pork is just too dry.  I shouldn't have to cover it in your bbq sauce (which isn't THAT good either) in order to make it edible.  Also!ref!3
It may look like a fast food joint on the outside but this place is local Arizona BBQ at it's tastiest. I ordered the 1/2 lb. pork rib dinner ($11.49) which came with two sides. They ran out of collard greens so I settled for two corn cobs.With the ribs and corn my face and fingers are super messy from the sauce. Good thing I'm eating alone. The ribs were super delicious! I wanted to cover every bite in their BBQ sauce. It was that good. The sauce was slightly tangy with just the right amount of sweetness. Honey Bear's calls it Tennessee BBQ!ref!4
love this place!!! the wait is long and the cashier is slow!!! there is one worker which i think is the owners son he has long hair he is awesome! he helped us get our food faster! but the other cashier was so slow!!! but besides the wait it is an amazing place the pork BBQ sandwich was Delicious and so was the coleslaw.!ref!4
This place has really delicious BBQ. I would have given it a 5 if the chicken wasn't a little dry and the interior of the facility was a little neater and cleaner. I'm not saying it was dirty!ref!4

I think I really like this place. Ayesha and I had a chance to visit  Cheuvront on a Monday night. It wasn't terribly busy when we arrived and we were warmly greeted. Unfortunately we were seated next to a loud group of young children that thought they knew something of the world and were very LOUDLY passionate about their arguments. The F bombs were being dropped so incessantly that it became annoying. Our server and the manager that was walking around said nothing to this group.

Tonight I made my first venture to Alice Cooperstown.  Why not?  I arrived at the ballpark early and wanted to fill my stomach.  I dig Alice and heard he ran a cool place.The decor was pretty cool.  I've never been to Hard Rock Cafe but I'm guessing it's similar in style.  But who goes to a restaurant for the decor?  Atmosphere adds to the experience but the food is what matters the most.I thought about trying the Big Unit dog but opted for the Gonzo's BBQ Beef sandwich w/ fries and Nightmare chili and I added the hot link for $2 more.The beef brisket was just okay.  I have much better and even for a few dollars cheaper elsewhere.  To be honest!ref!3
I really dint care for this place. the music was blah and the out door seating was lame.The only cool thing i saw was the big unit. A home wrecking size weenie some old man was trying to deep throat.!ref!2

The AZ Science center is great for kids which is why Adult's Night Out is twice as good!I checked out the science center at last nights first Friday of the month \""adults only night\"".  Not only was admission free but they validated out parking making it free as well.  We were able to check out all of the exhibits with little or no wait and with adults only it was much less hectic than on a regular day.!ref!4

What an amazing organization for empowering women. They have a really amazing mentor program. The program starts in some coursework and sociology to sort of prepare us. The classes were a blast and quite useful. The Mentor I met was incredibly helpful warm and kind and had great insight. I really miss our visits since I moved away because she was a wise lady with clear perspective. I really think that the Fresh Start staff went an extra mile and a half by placing me with a mentor who really was perfect for the path that I am on.Fresh Start also brought in some business training associates and gave out scholarships for them. I might have participated had I not been working at the time and had conflicting hours. I was offered a scholarship at the time and I think that any woman who applied herself would qualify.Fresh start has an impressive job database.They always had so many wonderful energetic staff who really transmitted a lot of information and light.Really wonderful organization.A+++!ref!5

Not good. Sorry. I can get pass the decor if the food was good. Keep going. Big warehouse style with table and chairs at the end. Some good reviews???? Must be the workers.

Let me start with the positive. The corn chicken soup was hot and the won ton chips were a nice addition to the soup. The chicken egg roll was very greasy. My main dish was the cashew chicken. It was white meat but had to pick through it to get a decent piece without icky's on it. The flavor was bland!ref!2

The sad fact is that most yelpers will eschew this place for it's two more accessible neighbors - Filiberto's and La Santisma - and that is a damn shame!ref!5
Hands down BEST pinatas I've found in the valley. A few years ago my favorite pinata store went out of business and I haven't been able to find a replacement up until recently. I throw lots of parties and love having a pinata for any occasion. When I'm looking for a pinata I usually visit multiple stores looking for something specific. What I find is the same old thing and more often than not- covered in dust. When I first walked into Pico Rico I was so please with the selection. Every row I went down I saw something new. There were plenty of varieties so even if it's not for a kids birthday party you'll find something great. Whenever I go back they always have new pinatas I hadn't seen before and something special for whatever holiday is near. The Christmas pinata I bought there was beautiful and unique!ref!5

Wonderful brunch today! I had the Sunrise sandwich and my husband had the Holy Puerco - they were both delicious. I loved the homemade biscuit - light and fluffy and not dry at all. Everyone in the staff is extremely friendly - very positive and relaxing environment. Highly recommend it!!ref!5
Had to update my review to share that I had dinner here last weekend for the final day of Arizona Cocktail Week. Of course!ref!5
GREAT music and tons of fun! LOVE the music!! Fridays is mainly for \""cheros\"" akaguys that wear pointy boots with matching belts as they play that kind of music. Notreally my thing but can be fun if you got your buzz going. Saturdays is hip hop!ref!5
By far the worst gay nightclub in phoenix and trust me I know gay nightclubs!!! Lol no seriously this place is crap I have been suckered to come here a few times for a birthday party and some other events and it's no fun the drag show is lame or the acts I have seen are the Dj is good plays some different tunes the a/c is non existent I think they use a swamp cooler. The bathroom is the size of a toilet stall and always packed that u have to piss in the alley where there is plenty of hookers at your disposal. The drinks are expensive!ref!1
This is a ghetto place!ref!3
I have been seen by the Nurse Practitioner Christa and Dr. Laura Kimbro so far. Both experieces have been good. They are really good about following up with you. They can do ultrasounds right in the office if your insurance covers it.  They do all their baby deliveries at Banner Desert.One small complaint...they take the whole thanksgiving weekend off. Although there is someone always on call!ref!5
Disney Land for Foodies. Fresh Baked Goods!ref!5
Oh the joy of walking thru Ranch Market... loved the produce section . lower prices!ref!4
I used to love Pro's but!ref!5
Did not live up to the hype.We went looking for those \""intelligent\"" dog toys... you know!ref!2
I have to down vote this business for a terrible customer service experience. On a blazing hot Friday afternoon I left work early and drove all the way down to McDowell to pick up some toys for my dog. I walked up and saw the posted hours-- 4:30pm close!ref!1
We stopped here later at night because Two Hippies Beach House was closed.  I'm glad we did!ref!4
One of my roommates was extolling the beauty of Bosa.  I asked if they were as good as Rainbow!ref!4
This place always runs out of items on the menu. I've ordered the chicken fried steak twice and it never comes with the fresh bread they advertise. In this visit alone I've heard the waitress tell two tables they didn't have baked potatoe or a breakfast item. Our waitress appeared lithargic and took a long cigarette break while all her tables waited on her and the cook. It was bad enough she didn't check up on her guest often enough. The team leader is no better. She's helped us twice before. Never smiles. its enough to make someone depressed. Luckly the food they have is great on an empty stomach. Love the unlimited hot coco. Avoid the water. Tastes like algee.!ref!2
My husband and I branched out to a new restaurant this weekend (Coronado Cafe in Phoenix) - our experience is why we don't like to branch out to new restaurants.  For starters!ref!2
I just moved into a new place!ref!2
Having had numerous favorable experiences at Coronado Cafe in the past!ref!2
This place is great. It is set up in a little house with a really cute atmosphere. They have a great patio and a fantastic personality. I was there for lunch and had a tuna melt. It was good!ref!4
Lite lunch with the ladies.  Two of us shared Crab Cakes and Caprese salad.  I could have eaten an entire platter full of the crab cakes.!ref!3
A good restaurant deserving of at least 4 stars and the potential to earn 5. Went there with my fiance for dinner.  We had the portobello sandwich ($11) and the green chili pasta with salmon ($19).   The sandwich was good!ref!4
Expensive and just ok.!ref!2
This place is definitely a favorite.  We've had really excellent experiences here (dinner and brunch)  - except for the most recent one.The atmostphere is romantic - a cozy old house with cute little rooms!ref!4
I miss this place.  I used to work right across the street from McAlp's and would go there at least twice a week.  The atmosphere is great!ref!4
It was 10:45 Saturday morning and I wanted coffee. I knew of a place right down the street from me and to my disappointment it was closed! WTF! Any way I went searching for a cafe. I wanted to sit down and read the new times with a cup of coffee. I actually started my journey thinking I would stop at the drip. But when i got there that place just seemed to modern for me. I was in a funky mood and just wanted a nice cup of coffee!ref!3
This place is fun to walk into!ref!2
You can't beat the atmosphere at this place. I bought a google offer for here a while ago and stopped in on a Sunday afternoon. There were some people inside but it wasn't too crowded. I started in the antique shop wandering around and then made it into the restaurant. I had an ice-cream soda and it was divine. Next time I'd probably split one as the drinks are large. I didn't eat anything but the food looked yummy. I also wandered to the vintage shop next door. It was fun looking around and reminscing.!ref!5
For a spark of nostalgia and a sweet treat!ref!3
Macaplines.. Go here for nostalgia!ref!3
I can understand how this location can get some extra points for being quaint  but it will certainly not get points for being clean.  The soda I had was great but I could not get over how dirty and run down this place was.  The staff where inattentive and to be honest completely useless!ref!2
great place and atmosphere!ref!5
Went there for the first time in a long time.   Food was mediocre at best.   Chef's salad was probably the poorest one I have had in a long time.   Vegetables were fresh and of a sufficient quantity.   However!ref!2
The Best Bean Burro Enchilada Style EVER!!!ref!5
Muy bueno!  Here's a hidden treasure in the old Garfield barrio.  It's located right next to Garfield Elementary School!ref!4
Red Chile Burro!ref!4
Rito's easily has the best red chile and beans in the world!ref!4
I think Rito's is overpriced for what you get. The burritos look huge because they use an over sized tortilla that hides the tiny amount of meat they use so most bites are filled with tortilla not meat. If the green chile burrito I ordered was filled with meat then maybe it would be worth $8. The beans were above average and I thought their salsa was amazing even though they charge 25 cents for two tablespoons of it. I expected to be blown away by the food here but it tasted just like the food I grew up eating. It made me want to hug my mom :)!ref!3
It had been years since I had been back to Rito's!ref!2
Incredibly slow service (25 minutes to get 3 basic tacos) and tacos are average at best.  My batch was very salty!ref!1
Yes!ref!3
On a recent vacation to Mexico!ref!4
Hands down the best mariscos(seafood) EVER! I love the shrimp ceviche and when I am in the mood for a hot plate the Shrimp Culichi is the best choice!ref!5
Absolutely fabulous!  Why do so many people fixate on the location?  The food was super delicious!ref!5
The service was pretty fast. I was not too impressed with food. Ordered the culichi shrimp and a consume. My rice was undercooked!ref!3
Should have known better than to eat in a place so dark that you can't see the food on your plate. Underwhelming and overpriced.!ref!1
Another place that is really serene and makes you forget you are in a large city! I really liked the Desert Botanical Gardens and I am totally not into flowers or botany!  We had been to DBG once before for Luminarias!ref!5
Dropping some stars due to the Luminaria policy. Myself and four friends bought tickets to the luminarias a bit ago. It rained today!ref!3
I've been to the gardens 3 times and that's why I'm giving it an overall 3 rating!ref!3
Another weekend of visiting Phoenix and what the hell am I gonna do besides eat?Unfortunately!ref!5
Awesome!Growing up in Scottsdale!ref!5
I love the garden.  I go walking here 3-4 nights a week!ref!4
At the DBG's for the first time ever a couple of months ago to check out the venue for my daughter's wedding. From the very beginning!ref!4
A great place!ref!3
This is one of my favorite escapes from the city while still within the city! I've lived in AZ for a year and have been visiting DBG on average once a month since my arrival in the serenity of the Sonoran. The way the plants take on a different character and color at various times throughout the year.....lovely! The paths are well-maintained!ref!5
Love the Chihuly Art throughout the gardens!ref!4
We went to the 8 to midnight viewing.   My take is that it was a one note show.  It was the light up Chihulu glass.  The 4 to 8 would have had the butterflies!ref!4
This review is mainly based on the Chihuly Exhibit and the wonderful job Desert Botanical Gardens does to keep this place looking simply fabulous.Been here a few times throughout my stay in PHX and each time we come back it gets better and better. The place looks a lot bigger than we remembered and had more paths and special interest to enjoy than last time.Came with the family and used a Groupon thingamajig. Daughter is a coupon clipper and did a great job on this one. We could not decide whether to see the Chihuly exhibit at night or first thing in the morning. Granddaughter was with us so we decided to go with the early morning adventure and we were not disappointed.Wow is all we can say. What an amazing selection of cactus!ref!5
What a wonderful place to visit. Especially at night during the holidays. This past holiday season the Chihuly exhibit was magical. Treat yourself and go.!ref!5
Terrible. Sergios installed sod at my house and didn't bring a roller. The \""crew\"" didn't even know what one was. When I called the office they told me another crew would come later in the day to roll it. I went ahead and paid. Big mistake. They never came back. The job came out terribly.  When I tried to follow up they ignore my messages. I recommend going with someone who's more honest and reputable.!ref!1
The 3 person team arrived early but that was ok.  I asked the price and after a bit of communication issues was given an hourly rate.  I have a very small front & back yard.  They rang the door 35 minutes later for their money and I was told I owed for a full hour ($95).  When l talked to the owner nothing was said about a minimum charge. They would have bad a repeat client had They been honest.!ref!2
Big rooms. Clean but have a smell to them. The included 7a-10a buffet breakfast is good (needs sausages!ref!4
Very Cute and Cozy Place! The Food was AMAZING! Seriously I have been thinking about it all day and whether my diet likes it or not I'll be returning very soon! I got the Appetizer Platter which came with a Pupusa!ref!5
I have been to this restaurant three times for lunch while at work!ref!1
I really like this place. We used to come here often and then didn't for a long time just because we weren't in the hood when they were open. The las two weeks I've been by and had a late lunch. The people that t=run this place are so genuinely nice. The ensalada drink is refreshing in this heat. I usually get a veg papusa and fried plantain. My husband had the chicken soup and loved it and then the chicken special and loved it. I'm so glad we went back.!ref!4
Loved this place.  The service was great!ref!4
Shortly after posting this review someone from Pep Boys requested I email them about the situation at hand. Would you guess I received NO response?! What a crock. Save yourself and do not bring your car to a Pep Boys Service Center!!ref!1
Not a bad place. Service is good with friendly employees. The food!ref!3
It's old.  It's tired.  The Embassy Suites here on North 44th hasn't changed much in the last several years.  But it's the only place we baseball fans prefer to stay.Sure!ref!3
Delhi Palace has won my heart for Indian food.  There is a great lunch buffet that is well worth a drop in from time to time.  I'm not sure if this location is associated with the Delhi Palace on University!ref!5
Avoid the lunch buffet.  Excellent Chicken Tikka Masala.!ref!3
went here with my bf and his friend. came in at 7pm. took 10 minutes for someone to even realize we walked in the door..then took about 35 min to even get our food. they didn't seem very friendly. luckily!ref!1
Decent. The dishes are somewhat bland and seem to be not quite as authentic as I have had in the past. The curry was ok and the tikka masala!ref!2
came here last Saturday night with a friend. the food is very good and you get a large portion - I had leftovers for lunch the next day. my only gripe is that the naan was a little more burnt/crispy than I like. I will be back to try their weekend buffet though.!ref!4
Really great staff - friendly and professional. But the facility is beat. Rugs stained!ref!1
Red Devil has been around since before dirt was invented!ref!5
Have been to red devil on a number of occasions and have enjoyed each visit. If you are not a fan of waiting for a table or waiting for a while on your food!ref!4
I have lived at Riverwalk now for about 3 years in a purchased one bedroom condo that I am still in love with!  Its about time I wrote my raving review!! About the Condos: - Both one or two bedroom condos are very spacious- Very large balconies- Outdoor storage space on the balcony- Built in bookshelves- Large windows for lots of natural light- Tall ceilings- Large tub/ shower- perfect for relaxing bubble baths- 3rd floor condos have a wood burning fireplace- Nice large tiles in the kitchen and bathrooms- large dogs and other animals are allowed- gated complex- pool and hot tub- work out facility - covered parking spot and some garages available for extra $Overall the condos are wonderful! Most condos have been upgraded with granite counter tops in the kitchen and bathroom.  Also!ref!5
Yay! Really great venue to get up close and personal to see any acts that you may like. Everything from jazz!ref!4
I came here years ago to see Henry Rollins Spoken word. (Totally awesome by the way: five stars.) The seats here though were absolutely HORRENDOUS! Now I'm 5'11\"" so I'm used to not having a lot of leg room so I'm used to sitting sideways so my knees aren't banging into the seat in from of me. Here!ref!1
I shattered the screen on my old Droid2!ref!5
I would not recommend this apartment complex to anyone. Several negatives affect this review:1. My car was broken into! This is a \""gated\"" community where the gate doesn't work half of the time!2. The apartment staff don't seem to care about their renters. Maintenance is a second thought!ref!1
Massive sewer roach issue and I will scream it from the mountain tops until it is addressed. I fucking hate living here...They act like they're all over it but they're not. The staff fucks each other and the units are poorly maintained. They put a dog area right outside my apartment and people just bring their dogs to shit and piss...The gate is constantly broken and there is no security here. When I'm in the pool at night I hear gunshots! When I asked about the shady online reviews at EVERY reputable online renters community/open forum my rental agent told me not to worry about it lmao!!!RENTER BEWARE!!!!! Please feel free to contact me before you consider renting here. I can't WAIT until this lease is up.!ref!1
This is by far the best BBQ place in Phoenix IMO.  The only problem that I always ran into is what to get.  All the meats are smoked to perfection and the link are spiced just the way i like it.The BBQ sauce is so good that I keep a gallon of this wonder in my fridge at all times.Oh!ref!4
Above average BBQ at a resonable price.  Large portions.!ref!3
This was a pretty decent place for good BBQ.  There isn't that much variety - mostly focused on BBQ meat sandwiches.  The good thing is that despite the small menu!ref!3
I feel bad giving them 2 stars!ref!2
Must have been an off day but still pretty good. Better luck next time!!ref!3
I've been going to this particular one since 1987.  It was a ritual to go there right after the Copper World race!ref!4
Honey Bear's provided catering for our wedding last month and the food was unbelievably good! We had the barbeque chicken and pulled pork--both were out of this world. They delivered the food right on time as well!ref!5
I really wanted to like this place since I really dig family owned businesses I guess I will start my review by saying I ordered via phone but when I called I got an automated system that was horrible and didn't route you to anyone instead it said to call another number. After placing a huge order they said it would be done in 30 minutes. I went to pick up my order an hour later and it was still not ready and ended up waiting another 30 minutes when I looked around it seemed that everyone there was waiting for food and no food was being served in a timely matter. After finally getting my food I really wasn't impressed. Pulled Pork-DryBrisket-DrySauce-Weak and needed spiceBaked Beans-Very good especially with the sausage Hot Links- Not bad but not spicyColeslaw- Very good Corn Bread- bland and tasted old!ref!2
I'm from Chicago and dying for some fantastic tasting ribs!ref!1
The food wasn't very tasty. The bathrooms will make you leave and not even ask for your money back.!ref!1
I have been to the Phoenix Zoo twice now. The first time was 3 weeks ago in 104 degree temp. Awful experience. We only went around the big animals side so my daughter could see them. All the animals were tired!ref!4
Nice typical zoo with all the usual animals with a few surprises and exceptions.The \""reptile house\"" was a joke.  The prairie dogs...dayum...they're obese!  The different themes throughout the zoo were cool.  And similar to the Toronto zoo!ref!3
This zoo is amazing. I love that they have two splash zones. Please make sure to have your kids bring water appropriate clothes to play in. The barn and petting area is my daughters favorite place to check out!!ref!5
I am surprised to see other reviewers rate it anymore than an one. I would have given it a zero if it was an option.  We went to the zoo with my family!ref!1
It was a nice zoo but VERY small. And I mean extremely small. I've been to free zoos that have more to offer. You could walk through that zoo in 5 minutes if you continues through at a consistent pace. Not many animals and they missed out on some really cool animals. Not worth the price in my opinion.!ref!3
Now this is a true dive.  I believe the sign out front says that they open at 6a.m.  And no!ref!3
ok food...def not thing worth driving more than 5 minutes to... i paid $6 for a burrito and a soda..not expensive but a 3 bite burrito shouldnt be 5 bucks..!ref!2
My cheese enchiladas had non-melted cheese in them. That's a basic prerequisite for enchiladas - melted cheese. Not impressed at all. This place is sophomoric at best. There are far more tastier places in the valley to spend your money on. If I could leave a half star I would. I will never eat here again.!ref!1
Don't go here if you have small children. This is a museum for 8 and up. If you are over 8 and have a love for fire engines and their history!ref!2
Papago is a great place. Staff is accommodating and friendly. The location and scenery are great. One key problem!ref!3
Unfortunately!ref!3
These guys are the best.  They know the products inside and out!ref!5
If you like spicy food!ref!4
Reading the other reviews here makes me think I must have landed in a parallel universe the night we ate here. OK!ref!1
Decent food... if you want \""Sichuan/Szechwan\"" food you have to ask for the black menu. We noticed when Asians came into the restaurant they were only given the black menu!ref!3
Average to a little less than average.  Staff was rushed and left me to call them over to get our check.  Waitress then looked at her tip with me sitting there.  Didn't mind looking back at her while it seemed like she thought about asking for more.  Food is average Szechwan fare.  Hot and Sour Soup is spicier and good!ref!2
Nice ambiance!ref!4
This is a restaurant I have been to umpteen times and thought of reviewing just now. Hands down my favorite Chinese restaurant. Though admittedly!ref!4
Kungpao chicken is the best iv ever had!Food is great!ref!4
For the price at lunch I am not sure you can get much better.  The food is good to great.  The price is cheaper then Panda Express and it blows that out of the water.  I love the Sweet and Sour!ref!4
Went with an open mind to try something new and out of the ordinary. Ordered pig intestine stirfry but server talked me into boiled beef and fish. What a mistake!  Flavor was different but initially good. After a few mouths full I began to have a numbness in my lips and tongue. I left and was still charged for inedible food. My suggestion is to go to Panda Express. Terrible food and service to match.!ref!1
The WORST EXPERIENCE EVER. Not only did they serve us EXTREMELY salty food - for all three dishes and one EXTREMELY SOUR- we had three people in our party!ref!1
There are lots of great restaurants near Phoenix area!ref!4
You can get anything and everything you can get from Costco in behemoth size.  I usually wouldn't write about a chain!ref!4
The staff is nice .... Tables never seem to be clean and treys the beef brisket was great except for the bread!ref!3
I guess you could say I have been here 1.5 times.  This is the closest walk in clinic to my work place so I have ventured here out of convenience.  The first time was last summer and I just felt ill all over.  After a total of 3 hours here they did not know what was wrong with me but were going to treat me like I had strep throat. Three hours is not too long to wait if the lobby had been full but there were only about 3 others waiting with me and what seemed like an army of employees.  I was in the actual exam room for what seemed like 2.5 hours.  They were \""kind\"" enough to give me a blanket which looked like someone had vomited all over it and then it dried to a crusty finish.  The nurses kept coming in and checking on me; taking blood pressure  and temperature and demanded I take a pregnancy test.  I told them it was highly unlikely I was preggers (since I was not getting any but I felt they did not need to know all my extra cirricular activities or lack there of so I obliged them).  Finally they wrote me a prescription and I was on my way.   They never gave me the results of my pregnancy test but I was able to figure it out! So!ref!1
I love the food!ref!1
I came to Souper Salad right after getting rejected by a closeby Quiznos that didn't accept my online coupon (a story I will write next).  I asked them if they had any specials!ref!4

Good foodFriendly service (only if they are not busy)I mainly go here for the appetizers and beer during happy hour!ref!2
We visited this Applebee's location last night.  We were out running errands!ref!2
No wait for a Wednesday night which was nice and the food came out quickly.  Fish and chips were crispy on the outside and still cold on the inside.  Sandwich was ok!ref!2
I just came back from visiting this location and I have to say the experience was just terrible. I've been to this location like three or four times but this time the experience was just awful. The waiter was not friendly!ref!1
A very odd experience.  We entered in the front of the restaurant where we were met by the hostess.  We told her we were there for happy hour and she proceeded to show us to what I thought was the bar area. Well!ref!2
Yesterday!ref!1
Since zero stars is not an option 1 shall do. One of the worst dinning experiences EVER!Me and my party of 4 sat down on a beautiful Saturday afternoon after the PRIDE festival just down the road. We sat and enjoyed the free chips and salsa and nothing else. After 25 minutes and ZERO service of a beverage or even an acknowledgement of our being there we decided to leave. If the place had been busy that would have been different but we were 1 of maybe 5 tables being used. Sad sad restaurant. Never again.!ref!1
Good place.  Friendly staff.  It has a nice little bar with a few TV's to watch the game!ref!3
Think twice before ordering online or by phone from this florist.I ordered a $185 \""European Basket\"" to be sent to a friend.  What was shown on their website was truly beautiful.  What arrived didn't even remotely resemble the photo.  I realize that florists reserve the right to make changes in an arrangement based upon availability!ref!1
Stayed here when I traveled for work about a month ago. What I liked:-Really liked the room; bed!ref!4
So disappointed.  My husband and I decided to have a little stay-cation because I am 8 months pregnant with twins.  Upon a riving to the hotel we were under the impression we would be greeted by vallet. Surely one of the great hilton hotels would have someone to park cars on a busy Saturday afternoon.  NO there was no one outside. Secondly the front desk gal was very friendly.  Good greeting she educated me on the package my husband had bought as I checked us in while he was parking the car. After I checkled in  I looked for someone to help me with our bags. Again no one there to help. So With a luggage cart in hand I found the elivator....ok so now you are telling me there is not even someone to help me get this thing to the 8th floor . When I got to the room they key card  that i was given didn't even unlock the door. So that meant toting the same bulky luggage cart back to the elevator back down stairs though the lobby. While 8 months pregnant mind u. I had it. I called my husband he came up to the room and went down stairs to get a new card. I checked out the room nothing extraordinary.  But I was jus ready to relax except I found old french fries in the couch and a dead fly on the bed....we will not be returning to the hilton.  For 200$. This has been a craptastic experience.  I really wish I had jus booked a room at the Sheraton or the local holiday inn.!ref!2

minus a star for not having an EPL ticket to show all the games. for F###'s sake you are THE english bar in phoenix and I can't watch my beloved gunners unless they are on ch 167?? come on.  If you are going to hang the flags and scarfs at least have the game!ref!3
The best place in town to watch European football (soccer for locals). I would rate it with 5 stars but the food is just tasteless!ref!3
Enjoyed the fish and chips. The fish flaky!ref!4
I have been here a couple times and generally enjoy it. The parking is not the best and it's a dark lit area. They have decent beer selection!ref!3
Been meaning to try this place for years and finally had an opportunity. Unfortunately it was a huge let down. The first bad sign was that upon walking in every table table that wasn't occupied had not been cleared from the previous diners. During the 1 1/2 hrs (!!!) that we were here there were several tables that NEVER got cleared. It took 20 minutes to get our drinks and another 45+ minutes until we received our food which was strange as no one else in the restaurant seemed to be ordering any food. There was a hair in the fish and chips (disgusting but mistakes happen)!ref!1
Oh King George!ref!2
Horrible service!ref!1

I decided to try the Bikram Yoga Studio in Phoenix and I have to say I am very happy with it.  This location is very conveniently located in Uptown Plaza next to AJ's.  Right off the light rail too.   I've been going for about a month now. My first class was with MJ who I think is awesome!  In fact all the instructors I've had!ref!4
Went for Sunday brunch (around noon) and were all pleasantly surprised!  The service was great -- you get your own pitcher of water and carafe of coffee.  The coffee was deeeelicious.  I made the mistake of ordering a tall stack of pancakes.  They were HUGE.  Honestly!ref!4

I have no hesitation in giving this review one star.  I wanted a Frosty!ref!1
I really like one of their managers who is here during the weekdays. He is very good at keeping the staff on their toes but I haven't seen him as recently as my last visit. The drive thru service is horrible with errors from ordering to inability to understanding the English language. This place has gone downhill.!ref!2
Parking! Parking! Parking! What a nightmare! I have never found a spot inside their parking area. I always park at the Wendys across the street and walk over. As for the service I can't complain!ref!2
10/23/13At the VA facility today for long awaited appointments. Prior to departing I had the opportunity to visit the travel office. At the travel office I picked up a number(69) from the ticket machine!ref!2

Not that I need to feel like I am at a 5 star resort but the lighting in here is jarring.The staff was a little to eager.  One woman followed me around and kept trying to offer helpful suggestions \""all you have to do is ask\""....Uh thanks but I think I got this all figured out.  Tried to make as little eye contact on checkout and the cashier kept saying creapy shit like \""well I know you'll be back\"".  Do people walk into adult stores and ask for help and recommendations?  Ekk.  Everything sold here can be supplied with the same general directions: 1) Insert 2) Turn on 3) enjoy.  No need for creepy chit-chat.  Just let me pay for my items and skeddadle.!ref!2
Hands down!ref!5
All I can say is!ref!2
This is my favorite deli in the valley.  Whenever I am in central Phoenix I work my schedule around making sure that I get to eat here.  They remember my name and ask about how my family is doing even when it's been months since my last visit.  The fact that you can see pictures of generations of family working behind the counter in one place really should mean something when trying to figure out why you should eat here instead of subway or some other massive chain.  I always get the new yorker.  This is the place everyone craves in their community for lunch and it exists!!ref!5
I always hear hype about China Chili...now I've been there a few times and it is decent but nothing to rave about.  Unfortunately I never made it there prior to the big move but I really cannot imagine that much changed in the way of food greatness.  My vote still goes to GHoHK.!ref!2
They do not use fresh ingredients!ref!1
The Salt and Pepper flounder is amazing.  The egg drop soup is amazing as well.!ref!4
Wanting to go to a Chinese restaurant that wasn't a buffet!ref!4
It's very hard to find decent Chinese food in Phoenix and this place is your standard fare. The house chicken and vegetable chow mein were very good as well as the vegetable spring roll. They're set up in what looks like a banquet hall which is a little weird at first but I do like how open it is. Definitely come with a group and order a few plates to share. We couldn't finish the two dishes between us - tons of left overs!!ref!4
oh no no no no!  i ordered the tofu and um!ref!1
The orange chicken and house rice were perfect together.  We added in a pork dish and it was a great combo.  They seated us quickly and had our drinks out right away.  The server checked on us consistently but wasn't annoying!!ref!5

Jamba Juice. Here is a company whose stock cost me a pretty penny on the market a couple years ago.  Even though this company stock burned me I still come in from time to time to relive the glory days when Jamba was opening up a few new stores around the country every week. The menu has gotten a whole lot bigger since then but it was nice to see they still have a lot of the classics. I found it interesting how similar some of the smoothies taste from menu to menu!ref!2
I just paid $20 for two drinks.  This place is delicious and healthy but the price is absolutely ridiculous.  The kale isn't fresh it's frozen. The drinks are good but not worth the price. Just juice at home or go to a neighborhood market.!ref!1
Rip . off.  Thief People Up In There.!ref!1
Now that I'm living back in Central PHX I got a membership once again at Movies On Central. I love their selection and I can usually find that odd arty flick here that most other video stores don't carry. Just like this weekend I was searching for \""Ladies and Gentleman Introducing The Fabulous Stains\"" starring a teenage Diane Lane and Movies on Central had it! I like how they have a cult movie section and section off movies by director.If you are a movie buff this store is for you.!ref!5
Used to be a serviceable record store but has become a shell of its former self.  OVERPRICED lps and the selection is almost the same as it was 10 years ago.  I am an avid collector and really find no reason to go here anymore.!ref!2
Came here for a couple of rounds after dinner--it was early like 7ish and the place was pretty empty!ref!2
Hanrattys is my go to dive bar. You cannot beat 2.50 bud and bud light drafts. Plus it is also an Ohio bar which I can enjoy. Not much of a crowd but it is a fun place to relax. They have real darts and pool tables. So there is plenty to do. The only downside!ref!5
All I can say is YUM!  This is my new favorite place.  Not only can you build your own salad!ref!5
Being on a No Meat Diet makes you think outside the box sometimes when your accustomed to being an omnivore.....so!ref!4
I have noticed the trend in all the location but today was the worst.  Coffee was cold and the cream was warm.  The lettuce had a faint smell of bleach or ?  There was almost no breads out but a few drier ones.  I took one and it was cold and soggy.  No one cleared my table or even spoke to me though there were people doing that at other tables.  The frozen desert!ref!1
Very upset this place has closed. Please come back! One of the few places in town where you can get healthy take-out.!ref!4

The cook is dirty... don't get me wrong the food is great... But don't eat if Chef Rudy is cooking he's dirty he does dirty nasty to the food..!ref!4
Really crazy selection of invitations. I cant believe how many books they had!! Wow!ref!4
This is the only place I go when I need greeting cards. The store has a wonderful assortment of gifts and seasonal items. The women who work there treat you like family.!ref!5
I agree that Juans is good but its not the best Mexican food I have ever had. What makes or breaks a Mexican restuarant for me is the chip and salsa and I thought the chips and salsa were average at Juans.I had the combo #15 which is a cheese enchilada and a beef or chicken taco w rice and beans. The refried beans were the best part!ref!3
Lots of food!ref!4
This place is awesome!!  been going here for years the # 1 is the way to go red chili is amazing!ref!4
This is a tough one. This restaurant is a lot of fun!ref!1
Alright!ref!4
I like so many things on the menu it takes forever to decide what to order. You have to keep in mind that you have to save room for the pzookie. This is a must! Pzookie is a huge chocolate chip cookie in a cast iron dish served warm with ice cream on it. UM Yeah!ref!4
Second try:So I am updating my review! Received the giftcard and went ahead and tried it again ( dinned in this time around ) it was PERFECTION.  We'll go back for sure!!ref!5
I've always enjoyed Oregano's. Who doesn't like their pizza and pasta dishes or their pazooki (i always share the half and half)?!But recently!ref!4

Absolutely horrible. Don't bother coming here. We came because its and Taco Bell and a Pizza Hut so everyone could get something they liked. We waited 20 minutes just for the tacos and 35 minutes for 3 pan pizzas. The staff was unapologetic and every single one of them gave us attitudes. The assistant manager did apologize to us but she should probably get rid of the whole staff there especially the young black girl who had the absolute worst attitude out of all of them. Don't go here. There's plenty of other places to go around here.!ref!1
They told me that the oil change would take an hour to an hour and a half. It ended up taking three hours as they waited for a part. In their defense they said it was possible it would take longer. That was fine but when the person at the frontdesk starts talking politics!ref!2

I just moved here from Seattle and wanted to have a hotdog.  I saw this place one night when it was close and we decided to go back the next day when they opened.The menu was intimadating at first!ref!5
Nothing special!ref!2
Literally the best. Always have free samples and are willing to skewer just about everything they own on a toothpick for you to try.This is a good first step if you dream of having a good relationship with a butcher like all those TV chefs do.!ref!5

I have been here one time and one time only. I will never go back. I took my two kids here since my son is into pokemon and my daughter loves my little ponies. Plus it's very close where we live. I tried to get one of the three people working to help us but they seemed more interested in avoiding helping us. My questions were answered with one word or a finger point. My daughter was able to find a couple of comics but we never did find the cards my son was pointed to. When we checked out the person behind the counter said is this it and rolled their eyes. Not the kind of experience i expected of a place geared to all ages. I was disappointed to say the least.!ref!1
I pass by this walgreens on the way home so I stop in frequently. Always able to find what I need. Clean and organized!ref!4

Great salon tucked next to Fuego Bistro. I have been seeing Mara for years and I leave a happy customer every time.

I have shopped here off & on for years. I am always amazed I return due to the awful service & attitudes but with so few Needlework shops in Phoenix I have bit my tongue & gone.  I recently inquired about a Special Order Canvas for my Birthday. I FB them & called both. After 2 weeks of trying to get them to help me they responded by leaving me a phone message stating they had No Idea what canvas I was talking about. I have ordered from them before. The canvases are hundreds of dollars & I fail to see where the confusion came in considering I had Put the comeplete title & artist in my facebook message. I have ordered the canvas elsewhere. I don't know if it is just me they seem to dislike without knowing me or if it is just being outside the clique that is the issue. Order online unless your a Stepford Sticher.!ref!1

Nobody understands. I have this weird affinity for Tokyo Express. But only this particular location. I've been to the other's in Scottsdale and Mesa and they just don't taste the same. Maybe it's because I used to come here for lunch in high school and almost everyday when I  worked at my crappy job down the street. Maybe it's just my nostalgia of growing up here and being young(er)....Mostly!ref!4
I went to this shop based on the high ratings. 12 days later!ref!1

Stopped in here for lunch today!ref!3
Way overpriced.  There sub should be priced at 6.50 tops.  It's just okay at best.  Their pickle taste like its been marinated in salt.  The worse part about it was that my buddy wanted to go somewhere else but we went to this place on my suggestion.  Fortunately!ref!2

First of all I cannot sew so this review is not from the point of a seamstress.  I went there for ribbons and other gold colored fabrics for center piece making and I def found more than I could ever imagine.  They have great luxurious fabrics as well as tacky sequin covered fabrics (I totally bought some).  If you need fabric you will find what you need or something very close to it.  The parking was ok but no lie the place is always packed.  As far as customer service goes it really depends on who you deal with. Some are chatty Cathys and others don't seem to care much for the customers. The bottom line is the place might look beat up but the selection is great and the people will cut your fabric and even give you a little extra if they see some damage.!ref!4
This place is as bad to be expected! Essentially a warehouse stuffed with random fabric scraps!ref!3
I'm adding to the chorus of \""the people here are incredibly rude.\"" They have this policy that you must leave behind two yards of fabric or you have to buy all of it - except it's not exactly uniformly enforced. I went to buy fabric today to make blankets for gifts!ref!2
Genny's is a hoot! I'm def Straight but NOT narrow.!ref!4

I have eaten here many times the staff is great and friendly. The remodeling gives this place the old time at home dinner feeling. Love to meet here for business or just meeting friends. Wish the rest if them were like this one. Can't beat the speed of service any place in town. This location is one of the after bar stops and gets extremely busy after 1 am nightly. It is well worth th wait.!ref!5

There aren't many Mexican buffet restaurants in phoenix. Maybe because Mexican food is best served fresh. I remember the 1st time my boyfriend took me to Panchos; he remembered eating there when he was younger & wanted to go back.  The salsa isn't very good; it's bland for a Mexican place. We have gone back many times and I must admit that it has gotten worse & worse every time. The food selection has gotten worse & the price higher. We also saw them on the dirty dinning report & they got a horrible rating and neither of us was surprised. It's sad!ref!2

I went here tonight after hearing good things about the place. I was very disappointed. The food servings were large but the food itself was not very good.

I do not think I will be going back after spending $46 dollars for so-so food. Very disappointing.!ref!2

Best chicken fried steak bar none in Phoenix.  I come here only for that but the fresh lemonade rocks here too.  The atmosphere is VERY casual and VERY country.

Horrible customer service. I'm shocked how they employ people who have such limited vocabulary and no common sense. Horrible attitude from the front girl \""Lucille\"".

Not a very good place at all.  Be very careful of this place as they tack on all kinds of move-out charges.

Because she is not a registered cleaning company!ref!1

Ate there for Valentine's dinner.  Too expensive.  Portions very tiny.  No bread.  Salad was tasty enough but consisted of about two tablespoons of mixed Greek salad.---I'm not kidding.

I've been going there since it opened in the mid-90's and was called the Andale' restaurant. I think they changed the name because too many people made the same mistake my sister (who took 3 years of Spanish in high school and college) did: She asked why the hell anyone would call a Mexican restaurant the \""Ann-Dayle\"". And so it goes.I've enjoyed most of what I've had there. Not the place to go while on a diet. Everything tends to be cheese-heavy. Partially for that reason I would forgo the sour cream and guac that they offer!ref!3
To be honest I was fairly disappointed with Aribas. People had given me mixed reviews prior to me going there and it seemed either people really liked it or weren't impressed at all; and upon going there myself I could see why.

What a pleasant surprise.  I selected PCG for a business dinner this week and all of us were thrilled with the meal!ref!4
The appetizers were very good. I enjoyed the much raved about \""Griddled Corn Cakes\"" The queso was also unique and delicious.The butter lettuce wedge salad was so delicious. They even chopped it for me to make it easier to eat.The pork tenderloin was so tender and moist. I\""m not a huge fan of this dish in general!ref!3
I have always enjoyed dinner with friends at Phoenix City Grille. I had never tried Happy Hour there so a friend and I decided to give it a try. We sat for almost 10 minute at bar before we were asked if we'd like a drink. The Green Chile Queso Fundido was quite tasty. We intended to order a few other items but We had to pry the bartenders to return for refills and food that we decided to leave and continue Happy Hour elsewhere. Keep you posted on our return to PCG...!ref!2
Loved.This.Place. Awesome candlelit ambience!ref!5
Impulse shopping for electronic equipment is a horrible habit to have.  Sadly!ref!4
greeter which is basically security was the coolest dude there!ref!1
I went here when I dropped my iPhone (tragedy...) and broke the speaker. I could hear my callers!ref!2
Brought my Yorkie in and they did an amazing job! Making my next appointment now. They clipped his nails bathed and cut and even cleaned his ears. This was one of the best experiences I have had at a groomers and I highly recommend them!!ref!5
This was the first groomer we tried out in the Phoenix area. They had good reviews on yelp and good prices so we gave them a try. I was not impressed and left really missing our groomer back in CA. I asked for my dog's tail to get special attention. She was given back to me with matts still in her tail and her face hadn't been cleaned thoroughly. Pretty disappointed will not be returning.!ref!2
Wish I could have wrote a better review about this place. The mechanic i spoke with Was a nice guy an i felt confident the work would be quick and easy. I had some repairs on my truck. I was expecting it to take a couple of days and was expecting to spend up to a grand. The work was done and the vehicle passed emissions. BUT!ref!1
Pam & Nibblers saved me!  Last minute office luncheon and they were able to put together a great menu. Prompt service and set-up!ref!5
Regi B. Regi  you placed a review on yelp stating bad customer service and you never had any business dealings with us. You had a car accident with one of our contractors and YOU did not have insurance!ref!5
This Starbucks closes late so that's the upside it has a cool patio and the inside is nice just the one thing I have to complain about is the Internet it sucks but I you come here for anything else it's all good.!ref!4
Have always enjoyed going here. Been going here for a few years.Went for a haircut today. Same great service. They get you in and out in a hurry but I've never had a bad haircut here.Love the hot towel and shave of the nape of your neck at the end.If you really want to pamper yourself sometime let them give you a straight razor shave. I've gotten them a few times and each time I've almost fallen asleep. Very relaxing.And like previous reviewers have noticed they are foreign but I've never had any problems getting across what I want.Highly recommended.!ref!5
I really don't even know where to start with this place.  I've lived in Central Phoenix for 8 years and have always heard about how great this place was.  That's the only reason I didn't turn around and walk out upon entering.  The decor in this place is cluttered!ref!1
This might surprise you!ref!4
Went here for a friends birthday. They have a nice outside patio. That you can reserve. Great options for sandwiches & wine. I absolutely love these types of places where it's a deli but also a great little shop with crazy jams!ref!5
15 minutes to make an egg salad sandwich with only 4 orders ahead of me? When I open my bag!ref!2
If I could give them minus 100 stars!ref!1
I like this CVS because it's close to home and open 24 hours. The store itself is alright. I like that they sell booze!ref!2
Fish was good!ref!2
I'm all for \""personal service\!ref!3
I've been back here a couple of times and...it's leaving a bit to be desired. They never seem to have my size in the sports bras I want!ref!3
The outside is a blah building!ref!4
Flavors of India serves up a decent lunch buffet.  I've been there a couple of times though and it seems some days!ref!4
The all-you-can-eat buffet is the best value in town! I just love the onion bhagis and potato pakoras. I believe there are always at least 2 chicken dishes and a tandoori chicken!ref!5
Food was ok. Service was poor. Saw a roach near our table. Not my choice for a lunch companion!!ref!1
Did not get too far into the BS. Was on hold for more than 45 mins to make an appointment. Just want to remind you all that this is a \""For-Profit\"" organization. Treat them like you would any business that serves you. They do NOT have any special product or service that warrants such crappy service.!ref!1
Love the family atmosphere!ref!5
My wife and I had a great experience at Burland. Trish helped us and made it a great experience.!ref!5
I called this morning because my USB hard drive is not being recognize by my computer. I asked what it would cost to repair it. I was told to come down and they'd take a look at it. I took the morning off of work and drove 45 mins to their shop on Camelback Rd. I showed up and they didn't even look at it. They said it would cost $200 for the inspection and up to $999 to repair it and they would have to send it to another place that has skilled people and the tools to repair something . They could have told me that over the phone and I would have not taken the morning off and drove all the way out there. I was definitely misled today and it cost me time and money. Their name is deceptive also because they cannot repair or recover data. They send it to someone who can. They should be called Data Mailers!ref!1
I would NOT reccomend taking your computer to Data Doctors! I hear there is a small privately owned computer shop on 24th St and indian School that gets great reviews. Data Doctors looked over my laptop for 20-30 mins in the store (20th/Camelback) and then the tech told me he would have to send it to the Tempe main lab for full assessment. $100 to take it in and figure out what the problem is. I got a call 3 days later from someone else stating they just recieved my laptop and were going to look at it the next morning!ref!1
Employees are friendly and helpful since this was my first time here. However!ref!2
I frequented this establishment years ago!ref!1
The second I saw the guy eying my windshield I regretted my decision to go here. Before he could say anything!ref!1
I'm so over this place.  Without fail!ref!1
I'll start off by saying that I've been to Danny's several times before and they've done a (mostly) decent job washing my car!ref!1
If I could give them a lower score I would. Horrible decline in quality of service. Very low morale of employees leading to poor service. Used to be great and I would go there before any other car wash or other service.!ref!1
What the heck happened here?  I have used this car wash for years and have!ref!1
I had a fairly decently clean car to begin with!ref!1
People are very rude! I was told for an extra $100 when can buff out all the scratches and it would look like a new paint job...no wonder this place has a bad rep!!! I had to give it a rating!ref!1
I went to Rochelle's Salon once before and hated the girl who did my hair. After about a year later!ref!5
My boyfriend and I traveled an hour on Thursday to come to your store based on the reviews and advertising of your business. We ordered two sandwiches!ref!1
Jason B. and I decided to try this place on Saturday night. I looked at the menu online and though the food sounded really interesting.We started with the Artichoke Croquettes!ref!3
Was recommended tp me to try by a co-worker.  Had a \""eh\"" experience.An \""eh\"" experience is what you say when recommending the establishment to someone else.  And that sums up my experience.Service had a rocky start...my friend started a tab before I got there and I sat for 15 min waiting for a server before I went to the bar.  Five minutes later a different server came over and had taken over our tab.  So problem solved.We had a couple of the 1/2 price apps.  They were good - calamari and potato skins.  Pretty standard stuff.  Overall!ref!3
Definitely a cool spot!ref!3
Why more [places like this don't exist in AZ!ref!5
Just not all that impressive from our POV..... ambiance was cozy!ref!2
I love the food and it is usually excellent service. I always visit the downstairs cellar bar. It has a hip rustic feel and pretty good tunes on the ipod. One of my faves!ref!4
Wow!  This place is good.  My first time in Phoenix and if I ever get back I'll be sure to dine here.  So should you.  Prego.  (You're welcome.)!ref!4
My go to place has been slipping a little.  The last couple of times I've come the food is either over cooked or under cooked.  The brie & tenderloin toast was over cooked the last 2 times to where the toast was burnt and still served and the bacon on the bacon wrapped shrimp was on the raw side. The service is still very good and the patio is awesome when the weather is nice.  They also have the best reverse happy hour which starts at 10 PM and I believe and goes til 1 AM.!ref!3
M'fn delicious !!! Amazing bartenders and servers... Great environment and the food is beyond delicious!!!!ref!5
Please tell your servers to be more responsive to their customers.  Don't sell so hard -pushy waiter that interrupts conversations. Offer a cocktail once!ref!2
Pizza was ok.. I ordered Vinnies!ref!2
This is a nice little pizza place!ref!4
Been to other locations and had wonderful experience there. So I figured I would go here but it was a bad experience way to demanding for me to order as soon as we sat down so we got up and left.!ref!2
Food is good for the most part. The employees could care less if your there however. Stood at the door watching the host and waitress flirt near the bar. Finally gave up and sat ourselves. Still no attention from a server so my wife walked to the counter to order. That finally got someones attention! We got some sodas and ordered our food but to our disappointment multiple people came in!ref!2
I think this is the only Big Lots I've been to in PHX -- and I've only been here twice. It's fairly ghetto!ref!2
I made it to Guiseppe's only after a friend had seen it on the Food Network.  I'd heard of it before!ref!2
I had a hard time finding this restaurant to review it because at first I thought it was called As Seen on Food Network....but I found it so on with the review. My wife first introduced me to this place by bringing it home one night for dinner. It was horrible; but I chalked this up to what I ordered (a dish that was a cross between Mexican and Italian food) and the fact that it was cold from the drive home. So when we were in the area we decided to go in and sit down for a meal and enjoy the atmosphere. Well enjoy I did...nothing says a nice night out to dinner like tables covered with paper and plastic cups for you can drink (don't adjust your screen; this is not a review for Peter Piper Pizza). But hey!ref!2
Service and food was excellent!! Red sauce is to die  for! Pregnant girl's dream!! Steve was an awesome Server. Order the risotto balls!!ref!5
First impression: Not great. We had menu shock when we saw the dinner prices. Dinner for 2 here!ref!2
What a wonderful experience! We actually were told about this local gem by a waiter at another restaurant. Then we found out that they had also been featured on one of my favorite shows!ref!5
Went here for an outing with six other friends. I do not recommend this since the place is small and quaint!ref!4
Everything here was amazing!  I can't think of anything that I was unhappy with!ref!5
With 32 reviews and 4.5 stars I had high hopes. We were sorely disappointed. The Restaurant:  Dated decor!ref!1
Boo!  This bar does not have anything going for it.  The place is tiny!ref!1
OK. I can't believe I've kept this secret for so long. I can't believe I'm about to walk out of yet another closet. But if I can help just one person...Yes. I crave. On occassion. Ok!ref!4
I've been fortunate enough to stay at several Ritz-Carlton hotels around the US... San Francisco!ref!4
I truly enjoyed the meal i had there.  I went in for lunch and it was delicious!ref!4
This place rocks.  Super friendly.  Not just fake friendly; really.  I am sitting here in the lobby working and one of the hotel staff came up and offered me cookies.   The place is clean; the meals are nice; it feels safe;  nice business center to print and fax documents; good fitness center and cut-rate daily passes to LA Fitness next door; very convenient; good laundry machines.   Even our kitty cat likes it.  Being out of your house because it is flooded and needs repair is no fun!ref!5
I live nearby  and have driven past this place many times. Today my wife called me and asked that I bring her lunch. Needless to say!ref!4
I love me some Merc Bar!ref!5
I haven't been here in over a year since I lived in the biltmore.I loved this place.  Great looking women and not as pretentious as scottsdale!ref!4
Trendy!ref!3
I like Merc for the dark!ref!4
This place is hidden!ref!5
This place was actually pretty hard to find as there are not signs outside the building. I would recommend using the valet  as the parking behind the building ends up being a lot more expensive.  When we got there the place was pretty full!ref!3
I don't know what happened to this place!  They once had great bartenders that knew how to make some amazing cocktails!ref!2
CPK. Creative. Pizzas. Kinda.When I think of the early 90s. I think of CPK. Of course I also think of Joey Lawrence on Blossom. But who doesn't!ref!3
Much better than the frozen variety.  Sort of better than the quick serve shop in the Fashion Mall in Vegas- from what I remember.  This place was just as I was expecting: way crowded at lunch time!ref!3
Not my \""cup of tea\"" -- too Yuppie for me!  Atmosphere way too \""sanitized\!ref!2
Rodney the waiter messes up the orders ALL of the time.Every food I have tried at CPK has been nothing but yummy!ref!2

Had eyebrows done and esthetician ripped my skin off in two places. I called and spoke to the manager Casey and she was rude and blamed me for it. I explained I have had this done a number of times and never had any issues. She asked that I come back in and I was seen by a different esthetician. I saw the new esthetician who was extremely professional and relieved the pain I was feeling in my eyebrow. She apologized and explained to me how this could have happened. When we finished she thanked me and apologized once again. When I was leaving!ref!2
I have been very happy with the care my dog has received at Squaw Peak!ref!4
We chose those restaurant because we wanted a good steak and the Omaha name is synonymous with that. Arrived on a Friday night around 8 pm!ref!2
Went in to look at a matching wedding band for my Tacori engagement ring.  The man that helped us was nice while we were in the store and was going to reach out to Tacori regarding a few questions we had.  He honestly wasnt overly knowledgeable about the brand!ref!2
This is a good place to do a lot of laundry in a short amount of time. It is probably five stars during the slowest hours. I wouldn't recommend coming on the weekends.  The laundry carts are hard to get and parking can be limited. They do have change machines that work well.!ref!3
Probably the worst tasting stuffed cabbage I've ever had.  It was sickeningly sweet (tasted sweeter than my soda!)!ref!2
Pleasantly surprised...thought this was just another delicatessen!ref!4
Not sure how I have missed this place as I live 5 minutes away but stopped in today for the first time for lunch.  The restaurant is very clean and like many others have said it is cafeteria style.  You step up to the counter and they prepare you food to order.  They have a great number of different sandwiches!ref!5
When I went in with my daughter we ordered vegetarian sandwiches and they were pretty awful.  I know they have great deli meats and such.  I complained!ref!5
Why does everyone hate chains? They are chains because their food is tasty and their menu works. I'm sorry if it's not owned by vagrant bohemians. I'm one of the masses!My friend!ref!5
Chapter 1 - Appetizers!ref!3
I'll admit!ref!5
My experience tonight fell very short from my normal experiences at Cheesecake Factory. This was my first time coming to this particular location to celebrate Valentine's Day with my boyfriend.  It was a very busy night which was expected and the staff handled the wait time exceptionally. Our waiter was very prompt and extremely tentative. My issue with the restaurant is with the way they handled a food health issue. We ordered the flat bread pizza as an appetizer but as we began to eat it we found plastic melted underneath the cheese. When we brought up the issue we were apologized to and explained that the flat bread comes wrapped in plastic. We still paid for this item on our ticket even though it was clearly a mistake the kitchen made.!ref!2
Why do people eat here?  It was packed on a Thursday night.  We had to eat in the bar to avoid a 20 minute wait to be seated.  Everything on the menu is SOOO Expensive.  The only reason we stayed and ate is we had a $50 gift card.Wanted to order something eat that we could share while having our cocktails.  The waitress could not recommend or guarantee anything that was gluten free.  So I just ate all the free bread and butter they brought and then we ordered dessert.  He got the ice cream sundae and I had a lemoncello raspberry cheesecake or something like that.  The waitress recommended it.  It wasn't very good at all.  I only ate a few bites because I didn't want to waste eating that many calories on something not so tasty.With three cocktails (A mojito for me and 2 gin and tonics for him)!ref!2
We came out on a Saturday night. We understand it is busy and there is going to be a wait. We checked in with our name!ref!1
not impressed. My salad was $17 for lunch!! and also NOT WORTH IT. Very pricey for what you get.!ref!3
The front desk girl a few different times wasn't friendly at all.  The food is good but portions are small.  If it weren't for the hostess that never smiles I would rate more stars.  Hostess should be welcoming!ref!2
FYI. Chili's still sucks.!ref!1
Went to the one near cave creek. I had the bacon chicken fajitas. I GOT FOOD POISONING !! BE CAREFULLLLLL :/ I have always been coming here!ref!1
Disappointed. Suzie was very rushed. About 10 minutes into my appointment another girl walked in for her appointment. Suzie sent her to go get her feet done in the meanwhile. This is the worst my nails have looked!ref!1
I decided to try this place when the nail salon that I usually go to was full and I'm so glad I did .Susie the owner greeted me right away she's very professional and hilarious  the salon is very cleanand not super Busy I definitely will come back here next time that I need a pedicure  thank you Susie :)!ref!5
La baguette was tr\u00e8s bon! pardon my franglish! I have more reason to frequent here now!ref!5

The second I came in to Au Petit Four I was really hoping to have a wonderful breakfast. Located in the old town area!ref!2
Overpriced and dirty.  Had lunch here with my wife and service was ok but salad they served was stale and moldy.  Ordered a raisin croissant!ref!1
This is MY store. Not yours!ref!5
I've been to this location a few times now!ref!2
Since the positives outweigh the negatives by a considerable amount!ref!5
Stopped in for some emergency supplies. (Emergency as in there was only butter in my fridge and I had one roll of toilet paper.) The employees were lovely as always!ref!4
Wow.  What a really terrible experience.  We went in here to get shadescreen material for our windows...I called ahead!ref!1
Amazing food and excellent service. LOVED the porcini rubbed delmonico.!ref!5
I went here with one of my friends for a yelp event back in January and it was amazing. Well I went back to try their $16 lunch plates(as we had a certificate from the yelp event) and was a little less than impressed. Let  me start with saying the service from our waiter Sergio was amazing!ref!3
I have always had a great meal here.!ref!4
We went to the location on Scottsdale Road last night. My husband went to one in Minneapolis a week ago and raved about how good it was and he wanted to take me to the one here. We were very disappointed in our appetizer and meal. We ordered the scallops entree for our appetizer and they were sandy. Our steaks were just okay and the crab I had on my Filet Oscar was very strong. I am hoping it didn't come out of a can. Our side was creamed spinach but it should have been called garlic spinach because they put a whole bulb of garlic in it. I LOVE spinach and I couldn't eat it. I had high hopes of a long over due date night with a delicious meal but we were let down. We won't be giving this restaurant another try; too many mistakes for the price.!ref!1
Rarely do you find such value at a $$$$ restaurant. Portions are larger than you'd expect even in the small plates for expensive ingredients like filet Mignon!ref!4
The room was comfortable!ref!3
I really can't comment on the \""value\"" because my company picked up the tab!ref!4
I had a very similar experience to Allison G. (review written on 9/16/2014). I went in to collect my money at My Sister's Closet at T&C today. I approached the sales gal standing at the register and explained to her what I was there to do. I was told to go to another register in a rather apathetic and dismissive demeanor. Prior to today!ref!2
People seem to really like Sam's!ref!2
I had a massage here and LOVED IT!  Caite gave me one of the best massages of my life!  I can't wait to go back and see here again!The reason I gave this place 4/5 is for the decor/set up.  They advertise themselves as a spa but the decor makes you feel like you are in a Fantastic Sam's or  Super Cut (things for sale up front!ref!4
I have been to Zen 32 so many times I can't count them all.  When I first started eating sushi (my second experience was here) I came to Zen 32 with some friends.  I was still afraid of sushi so I got the teryaki chicken which I must say was quite good.  I ate a bit of sushi on that first visit and I began to get hooked.  If I had reviewed Zen 32 after my first visit or two I would have given in a 5.  I like the atmosphere and there is something about the outfits the waitresses are forced to wear that still appeals to me.  The service has always been good and I enjoy that they have seating both indoors and outdoors.Now for the food.  First!ref!3
I loved the free wi-fi...but the coffee was just ok.  Wish that they would switch to a different brand of soy milk since the Silk soy has a pretty strong flavor profile.!ref!3
I've spending a lot of time with a friend who is a pretty serious coffee drinker.  A couple nights ago!ref!1
Nothing like an Iced Almond milk Extra Dirty Chai to get this day started!!!!  A must try here.....!ref!4
I went in for the lunch buffet and I will never return.  There are better buffets with greater selections around the same price.  The selection here was limited compared to other chinese buffets I have been to!ref!1
This is a restaurant I go to because I am hungry!ref!5
This is the best Cajun resturant in Arizona. I've lived in Louisiana before and this is as close as it gets for AZ. I had the crawfish ettouffe and its was awesome and the most authentic I've had since living in Louisiana. My wife had the sampler and she loved it. The atmosphere is great. The live music added to the experience. It was kinda loud though. The waitress was kind of wierd. I would recommend this to anyone looking for some good  cajun food. It is on the pricey side but its worth it.!ref!5
I've been to Baby Kay's a couple of times and have sampled the catfish!ref!2
Because we are so far removed from the French Quarter my stomach rarely directs me to Cajun. Let's be honest there are few options in this town.  So this becomes the default spot to scratch the gumbo itch.  Above average food!ref!3
My boyfriend and I are both from Louisiana so we were excited to try Baby Kay's. We both had the Bloody Mary which were spicy and full of veggies which we loved. He got the shrimp po-boy and I got the veggie \u00e9touff\u00e9e. Both were quite good. On our second visit he got the sampler which he was less impressed with. Next time we'll stick with the poboy! No vegan options unless you are in the mood for a salad.!ref!4
I went there for lunch with my boyfriend. We are both cajun food fans. We ordered the spinach artichoke dip with crab. I ordered jambalaya!ref!2
The Doc fixed my eye & the staff rocks... you all get out of Jail for free... Maricopa County Jail only.!ref!5
Great ambiance for a Asian fusion restaurant!ref!3
I have nothing compelling to say because this restaurant is unremarkable.  The food is good.  I have eaten here a few times when I was with a group.  I wouldn't ever choose it on my own accord.!ref!2
You usually can't go wrong staying at an Embassy Suites hotel.  The rooms are huge and the breakfast is yummy.  You can sometimes get free happy hour drinks too!!ref!4
I've stayed here twice before!ref!4
Huge rooms. Soft towels. Comfortable bed with tons of pillows.  Three things that make me happy when I'm traveling.  What's wrong with this place!ref!2
Check in staff was great the view from out side was ok. Then the room electrical switches that are barely sticking out some you can see wires on. Paint was peeling all over and the shower was falling apart the caulking was all coming off. These rooms are not what I expect for this price. Even the tv which was a older flat screen did not have HD and half the channels failed to work. Breakfast was not great and  they failed to clean up tables so no where to sit and eat. Pool area had several areas trapped off as well as the parking lot had a lot of it closed. Over all very disappointed in this property I would not recommend it. When I checked out I was told your good to go as she ate her breakfast and then walked away not once was I asked how my stay was.!ref!1
Our family spent Christmas at the Embassy-Biltmore and had a wonderful experience!! Upon check in we had reserved 4 rooms and I walked up to the front desk greeted by the friendly staff led by Joe ODonnell. I said my name once and Joe was aware of my reservation and the requests on the reservation. Without even looking down at the reservation!! This was the beginning of a stay that was perfect in all ways. The rooms were clean and the property was very well kept! It is an older property so we did not expect it to be new but we did expect clean and that is what we got! All of the employees that we encountered were fantastic!! The cook to order breakfast was phenomenal with wonderful staff there working for us on Christimas morning! The happy hour reception was enjoyed by some of our family and they commented how much fun they had with the bartender!ref!5
The ambiance was amazing!ref!2
The food was pretty disappointing for the price!ref!3
I was really excited to visit the Wrigley for my friends birthday. I have been meaning to try this place for years and the Yelp hype has been pretty strong. I was immediately impressed by the staff!ref!2
The food was below average relative to the prices. I enjoyed the food!ref!2
The best thing about this meal was the view.  Because we had a voucher!ref!2
Now I had a very bad experience with this groomer. Now the shop owner was sweet at first but in my opinion must have become jaded over her long standing years as pet groomer because when I heard my dog cry out from the back room and asked if it was her lori's answer was \""that falls under the category of oh well that's to bad it has to be done\"" I couldn't believe she said that to me but I kept silent I just knew my dog wasn't one to cry like that anyhow I'm going to make a very long story short and let y'all know that the result of that was my poor baby nails being clipped on one paw way to short so short that they were bleeding however I didn't know until I got home and rinsed her off to make sure she was hair free and the powder she had stopped the bleeding with came off. I'd wondered why my pup was acting so odd and scared. I called Lori and she admitted to the accidentally cutting her nails to short and I'm not one to be an ass but why wouldn't she tell me before I took my dog home where I have a very well taken care of white antique couch? Her unprofessional attitude and smart remarks not to mention very dirty waiting area taught me not to be so quick to trust just anyone with my pooch. The least she could have done was tell me what happened before going home or was it perhaps it was the $12 tip she was afraid id take back well I'll never know because I'll never return to have my dog done there again and I say you don't either. Sorry for dragging you through the mud Lori but in your own words \""that falls under the category of that to bad it has to be done\!ref!1
Great place to sit and drink wine on a Saturday afternoon where you have nothing better to do. Food's average. Lots of people watching which I  love. No indoor seating though so avoid when hot.!ref!3

This Saks location has to be my personal favorite for their service style. Everyone is friendly!ref!4
I travel frequently!ref!2
get the ngocchi and that is all I have to say.... do it before you die.   The stuff melts in your mouth and I have never had it taste so good anywhere else.  The food and service are great at this place and the prices are like a really high end restaurant.  This place has been around since the 70's and it shows...which is my only complaint.  I really wish they would remodel this place and revive it a little bit because the food is really good.  The owner is always around our server has worked there for 33 years if that doesn't tell you something.  The atmosphere in the bar is black and white checkerboard tile with mirrors for walls.  The dining room has been painted but the furniture is a little dated.  I ordered the veal Marsala and it was fantastic!ref!4
I go here when I want to stuff myself silly on the weekend after a night of drinking. I always order the chicken fried steak and it's VERY good. I am a huge fan of chicken fried steak and eat that anywhere I go and this one is in the top 10.The staff is very friendly but they do seem to be understaffed for the most part but they get the job done.The Cinnamon roll is delicious and HUGE. I have to take it home with me for later because I never have room to eat it while I'm there.You'll most always find this place filled with an older crowd but that's fine!ref!3
I've been in the process of moving!ref!4
Ruby Red Crab Legs ....YUM!    (There is a big $$ though for this Yumminess!....$70).   We started our meal with the N'awlins Shrimp appetizer.   Cajun spices but with \""little itty bitty\"" shrimp.   It was just OK.   We actually ate at the bar.    The bartender!ref!2
Steamers seems to be a Phoenix/Scottsdale staple for good seafood. The food wasn't bad!ref!3
Was here for a KYOT Wine-Down-Wednesday event a couple of years ago.  The bar area was packed.  Stood around waiting for a table to open up- very uncomfortable as the area is pretty small.  I remember trying the New England clam chowder.  Tasty!ref!3
I had read good things about this place!ref!1
The store is small and uncomfortable!ref!2
The closest touristy!ref!4
Absolutely unbelievable dry cleaners! This business understands customer service and exemplifies it with every interaction. Lee is phenominal. Pretty sure this is the type of business that like a dentist!ref!5
Another fine dinner at China Village.  I ordered Ma-Po bean curd for dinner.  I had enough to share with my dinner mate.  The service was excellent as usual.  The hostess was very concerned that my group enjoyed their dinner.!ref!4
I was in town -- will be moving there soon -- and looking for some good Chinese food. I haven't had any in years. Anyway!ref!5
Let me tell you about Frank's Pizza on Indian School. I placed my order today 3/18/2012 online at 3:15 for pick up. When I arrived 40 minutes later I was informed that their system was down so they never got the order. Got my money but not my order. I figured ok!ref!1
Lara was the best.  Incredible customer service.  Thank you for picking up slack for some other PB locations.!ref!5
My husband and I wound up here after attempting to go to the \""Other\"" cupcake place in Phoenix!ref!5
I got the most delicious carrot cake from Barb's the other day for my friends birthday. It was such a hit! The best carrot cake I have ever had. I was not surprised though. Everything I have ever had there was yummy. They have the greatest cheese danishes!ref!5
Is is awful customer service!ref!1
This is part of a local chain!ref!1
This place is very overrated. Food will cost you 15-20 dollars per person!ref!2
this is the best car wash that I have used in Phoenix.  yelp coupon doesn't hurt either.!ref!4
Horrible service. I bought a $400 belt for a buddy of mine for his birthday and he went the next day to get a bigger size!ref!1
I know I will upset some fellow Yelp friends with this review!ref!3
The problem is that the atmosphere is subpar!ref!2
When it comes to food and service!ref!5
Loooooooooooove me some Houston's! The hubs and I really dig this place!ref!5
We came here today for lunch for my brother James' Bday.The lighting is very dim inside which I liked. The decor is modern cowboy!ref!2
Yeah!ref!5
As I begin to write my review I realize the server I am about to disparage is gossiping with the hostess behind me discussing her discontent with her most recent tip. This is NO Houston's! What happened to ensuring a well manicured table!ref!2
DISAPPOINTMENT NAMED SALAD.  I've been going to Houston's for 23 years (I started young) and I've been getting the same dish EVERY single time.  Why?  Because it's great EVERY single time.  Never have to worry.  Except this time.I usually split the salad with someone along with the artichoke dip.  Dip = great.  Salad = Worst.  When did we change it up and add corn?   And the portion was the size of a side salad.  Side salad?  Really?  Are we that pretentious Hillstone?  And never mind about mentioning the difference of proportion to your waiter.  It doesn't go anywhere.  Which was another first.  All in all!ref!2
C'mon man! Really! Your killing me! Houston's is such a great food and service oriented establishment that I was excited to take my wife there for her birthday. We were seated right away and the waiter was quick to ask for the drink order. We ordered wine by the glass. I like the service as far as they give!ref!2
LOVE Hillstone it never dissapoints.  We ended up at Hillstone last night after being badly mistreated at another restaurant.  (an hour and a half wait that never got us a table)  We arrive at HILLSTONE  hungry & frustrated we explained to the host what happened..... He told us another 20 min. wait we went to the bar and before we had our drinks we had a table! Not to mention a complimentary appetizer and a really lovely waitress.  We were so grateful to be treated so well and the food was outstanding!  Hillstone saved our girls night out and cemented our love of the restaurant!!ref!5
My boyfriend took me to Hillstone on Saturday night for dinner to celebrate our 3 year anniversary. 1-The interior is stunning. A gorgeous patio with big open windows!ref!4
Literally \""As good as it gets\""!!  Everything was top notch!  Great beer selection; I had a French Kronenbourg!ref!5
Very loud and boisterous and bustling!ref!4
My absolutely FAVORITE place EVER!! Seriously I've been going to Houston's concept restaurants since I was a teenager and this along with all the others never disappoints. The Hawaiian Ribeye is melt in your mouth delicious and I dream about it... seriously! Service is always amazing (especially Tom at the bar) and I am full and happy every single time I leave! If it was just a tad bit less expensive I would be there weekly but unfortunately it is a once every couple months type of place for me. That's ok though it gives me time to miss it!!ref!5
Hillstone: you are overrated. You think you are better than you are. Every time I go!ref!1
We came during a weekday lunch!ref!3
I had not planned on being a Mac owner.  My family - oh so very sick of me constantly complaining of Vista -  on first an HP!ref!4

The people working at this store are awesome- they remembered me the both times I went in.  I will drive to this Autozone over the others because they are so friendly.  There was a line both times!ref!4
Outstanding memories of this place...Valentines Day 1999...Absolutely first class service!ref!5
My Husband and I went to Vincent's last night for restaurant week.  We picked this restaurant because we had never been there and the menu for restaurant week appealed to us.  Overall!ref!3
We tried Vincent's for Restaurant Week. When you walk in to Vincents there is a bar lobby!ref!3
This is a great spot for a date!ref!5
Pro:  value!ref!4

I was recommended to Dr. Bauer by a friend.  The first time I called to get in!ref!3
I go here 5 days a week for an hour somewhere between the hours of 5am-7am. Its dirty. The cardio equipment is usually broken or about to be broken. Bikes missing pedals. Treadmills with torn pads or that literally stop moving at speed randomly in workout. Morning staff cares none about faulty equipment.Everytime it rains!ref!2
This location started out as The Q!ref!2

The new owners of Ice House Tavern are no longer hosting live bands. This is such a disappointment to the local music scene!!ref!1
This place is a vegetarian mecca and a lot of the soy meat is gluten free which is a huge perk for people like me. The atmosphere could use some work but the food is good and it is priced well. They have fresh juices and a very healthy vibe. The service is always good and it is never super packed. If you have veggie friends that haven't discovered this place it is a gem.!ref!4
I'm in turmoil on who I should rate this place. The decor and atmosphere is two stars. It smelled disgusting when we walked in!ref!3
I am not a vegan but love vegetables and would prefer to not eat meat most of the time. This place has the best spring rolls I have ever tasted. My sister-in-law is vegan and I went with her and she liked it too!!ref!4
Here's the honest truth on this place: Good food!ref!4
DON'T LET THE OUTSIDE SCARE YOU AWAY! This place is GREAT! It took a few mins to get seated/acknowledged!ref!5
Okay!ref!3
YAY! They have SPAM!!!!!I was going to go for Meat Plate #4 but when I saw the Grilled Spam with Eggs!ref!3
As long as you go in not expecting authentic Hawaiian food!ref!2
This is a solid place for those seeking Hawaiian food since it's not a very common type of food found in this area that I have seen.  I tend to favor the Chicken katsu which is served with boiled cabbage!ref!3
I've only been to a Hawaiian BBQ place once. In Clearwater!ref!4

I have never written a review before but felt I needed to after my experience with Croque. We order from Croque all the time and most often have the food delivered.  In the past the food would arrive around 20 minutes later than we were told but it wasn't a big deal.  Today when we ordered we were told our food would be delivered in 30 minutes.  An hour later still no food.  My boyfriend called and the lady told him the food was on the way without even saying sorry or anything.  Another hour went by now we had been waiting 2 hours for our 30 minute delivery.  He called back and told the lady we still had not received our order.  She said it's on its way again.  He told her I hope you are not planning on charging us for this food because we have been waiting 2 hours.  In a pissed off voice she says \""Oh so you want a free meal???\""  After some arguing she said she would not charge for the food.  Twenty minutes later I received a call from the drive.  She told me her boss said not to charge for the food but demanded... \""you have to tip the driver\"" over and over again.  I told her she could talk to my boyfriend when she got here.  She then called back three more times yelling that we had to tip her.  My boyfriend told her just so you know I was going to tip you but when you deliver food 2 hours late you shouldn't call your customers and demand that they tip you.  Tipping is optional and it's based on performance.  When she got here she rang the doorbell 8 times in a row (No i'm not making this up) Needless to say at this point we did not tip her and will no longer be ordering from Croque.  Their customer service is a Croque of $#!%.  (Sorry I had to!!!!)!ref!1
I was reading the Talk thread on book clubs and I recalled this place.It is a diamond in the rough and I shall go there this week to pick the cumulative brain of their staff:)Book Gallery is a place to lose time in the lovely smell of old books.  Remember when libraries had copies of books with cut pages for regular circulation?  When cellophane was a method of book covering? This is that kind of place.  Complete collections of out of print serials!ref!5
I love this place. The merchandise is constantly changing and they have the best bedding (and prices) in town. And the reading glasses - cutest ever. Cookware - check. Towels - check. Cutlery - check. Really!ref!5
Took my commuter in for an oil change and was very pleased with the cost and speed that it got done.  The location is perfect as well to just take a walk over to Costco to shop or snack while waiting.  FYI Check for coupons on their Yelp page before going it might save you some money like it did me :)!ref!3
Reasonable prices for great service (I'm usually out the door for $26 total).  These guys won't let you sit around too long.  If you want to talk!ref!5
I love getting a shave. Its a personal treat for myself that I try to get once every other month.  I've gone to this V's down the street from me about 4 times for a cut and shave and only twice have walked away happy and those were my first two visits and it just kept getting worse. Trying to get an appointment on Friday or the weekend is a wasted effort but then again so is trying to make one for any other time. I thought I knew the the drill with this place by now. Close at 6pm no shave appointments past 5pm all of which I can understand for a good cut and shave. So today with my girlfriends birthday weekend around the corner I call in and make my appointment at 5pm for a cut and shave knowing full well I had a less than great experience on my last visit. But a boy has a right to dream I guess. I leave work early to be there at 5 mins early only to be told to sit and wait a half hour which sucks but its not the first time they have failed the appointment game for me thus the 5 mins early. But I think I'm getting my shave so I sit and wait my turn.After my wait they get me in the chair and give me the worst speed cut I've ever had. My scalp still stings 2 hours later from the buzzer being dragged through it. After the \""cut\"" the barber (if you want to call him that) asks \""Did you want a shave too?\"". Is it really that hard for someone to tell you up front they don't have time to give you a shave?I was kind of at a lost for words which wasn't a problem for him because he filled the silence with \""Cause I can buzz it off and save you a few bucks but we need to close our doors\"". Knowing that I have a full schedule till the weekend and thinking it couldn't be worse than me doing it myself I made the terrible mistake of letting him \""buzz it off\"" which is the equivalent of letting someone take an electric sander to your face. No oils!ref!1
Went to see Amy on a Groupon.  She did the fastest cut in the west!  It looked Ok!ref!1
One of the best quickie Mexican take-out joints in the valley for everything from simple carne asada tacos to chicharrones en salsa roja. I love that they have authentic!ref!5
The \""street tacos\"" here are outstanding.  Consistent quality w/ a hot sauce bar that apologizes to no one.  Friendly staff.  Hear me now!ref!4
I have to give them a 5 for their Guacamole and chips.I am just in love with it.Everytime I go to the US!ref!5
This place is always busy!ref!3
I have to fall somewhere in the middle on this place. Elie's gets high marks for being a family-run establishment and for having super-friendly and likeable service!ref!3
I'm Yelping about this Fazoli's because I had the most amusing!ref!3
Mama Mia! Fast food Italian. Who woulda thunk it? Well. Somebody incompetent and passionless. I would rename this place Yuckoli's. Fits better. I knew I was treading on dicey turf going to this joint. But it was in Rickie's old hood and the culinary establishments were limited to fast food and chain restaurants. So I went basic with spaghetti and meatballs (oh God!ref!2
The hostess/lady who took my order was very polite and created brief and pleasant small talk. I ordered 2 cheese slices to go and my food was given to me within 5 minutes. The price was reasonable. The pizza was in my opinion slightly above average. The restaurant itself wasn't the most charming and the location wasn't the greatest but not the worst either. But for quick take out it was ok. Giving it 3 stars.!ref!3
More of a 2.5 but I'll give it three because the owner was nice. She clearly knew almost everyone coming in and out of the place and had lots of repeat customers. The place is dank and the plastic red table cloths are sticky. The mural is very cheesy and now well-painted. The owner is nice but I have smelled few people who emanate the smell of cigarettes more strongly. It is awful and it made us feel a bit sad/depressed for her. It made the place seem gloomier. And it is NOT appetizing. The cheese sticks were ok and the sauce served with them was passable. The pizza was sort of ehhhh...The cheese quality was a bit low and the sauce just didn't work that well as a pizza sauce. Crust was cooked well and had a bit of crisp on the bottom. I would not come back here. It was middling at best and a bit depressing.!ref!3
I have only gone here for kids/baby gifts and it's a great place to find that perfect!ref!3
Went there today to get help with ordering unique!ref!4
I would never go there again. I walked it there and the guy looked at me like I was bothering him. I guess my money will bother him too.!ref!1
AWFUL experience today...long story short!ref!1
We were staying at the Royal Palms for a couple of days and everyday we would have breakfast at T Cooks. It was delicious. Most memorable the frittata with artichokes and sundried tomates. Dinner wasn't so great - I wouldn't recommend. The dishes were too strongly flavored for the ingredients. I had a mushroom soup that I couldn't finish - it was way to intense.  Also had a monkfish wrapped with bacon which is normally a great combo but I'm not sure what oil they fry with or what amount they used!ref!3
Mmmmmm!ref!5
I had the best experience with breakfast. The ambiance- excellent- the reason I am coming back and can have a 5 hour dinner. The service- pretty goodThe food- from \""ok\"" to \""really good\""  (but not the best)I recently had an over saltet paella. Great for happy hour!ref!4
I just came in for an OJ and one of their fruit cups!ref!3
I waited 20 minutes for my asiago bagel and I was the only one in the dining area  but they forgot about it and burned my bagel. Service is terrible.!ref!1
I have wavered between 1 and 2 stars for this place.  The manager is very helpful and genuinely wants to see your pool clean.  I'll raise it a star for the solid manager.  I would give it 1 star if not for the good service.  I have owned my house and cleaned my pool for 3 years now.  It has its own share of issues!ref!2
Not overly impressed. I stopped in with some colleagues while on business in the Phoenix area. I'm trying to limit my meat intake and opted for the veggie sandwich. Major disappointment! I essentially got shredded iceberg lettuce and tomato with some herb spread and a slice of cheese. I think that if a restaurant is going to put out a vegetarian selection they should be a little more serious than lettuce and tomato. Mushrooms!ref!2
Unless you get Holly to cut your hair avoid this location at all cost. She seems to be the only person in the entire place that understands she is supposed to listen to what the customer wants. I recently got my haircut there from someone other than Holly and was absolutely butchered!ref!1
This store discriminates against customers who may have problems carrying items since you are not allowed to take a cart out.  Why is that?  Target next door lets you take your cart to your car!ref!1
I am SO mad at this store location today.  It is my son's 3rd birthday and I actually came into the store 10 days ago to order a Planes (the movie) themed birthday cake.  The woman at the counter took my order!ref!1
I had an absolutely stellar experience at All Smiles.  I finally got dental insurance!ref!5
I gave all smiles rave reviews initially but since then have had a horrible experience there.  First!ref!1
I used to go to Ingleside animal hospital for all my pets needs. I had a very sick kitty that they could not figure out what was wrong. The only option was exploratory surgery for an amount that was way out of my budget. I also didn't think my kitty would survive the surgery. They attempted to find every $!00 treatment they could over the course of several years. Never did figure out what ailed him. They got the money in the long run. Once my kitty needed some more antibiotics for an abscess that Dr. Serbin had already seen and prescribed for. The abscess came back. I had recently lost my car and my job and asked if they could just call a script in to a local pharmacy as i didn't have the $ for a cab ride or the visit. It had been 4 months since his last office visit and like i said they had seen this poor kitty dozens of times on deaths door over years. He told me it wasn't ethical to prescribe the meds that i needed to come in. I was irrate. I had just been in there for another cat 2 months prior and had a standing antibiotic script for him so I asked if they could call in the script for the other animal they had just seen. He told me that he wouldnt because he knew I would give it to the other animal.  I ended up having to get my hands on some from someone else. otherwise my poor cat would have went without. I wrote a letter to them of how upset i was and got no reply. A few years later after trying many other vets and the sick kitty had passed away the other kitty I had needed a dental cleaning. I had saved adamantly to acquire the funds to get it done over 2 years. (its very expensive. In light of my experiences there I trusted their competency with doing the dental surgery so I returned back money in hand over $400. My anger from previous grievances were furthest from my mind had just about forgotten and just wanted my cats teeth cleaned. On the day of the appt because of my cats age they did pre blood work for the surgery and it came back he was diabetic. I couldn't believe it i had another cat that was diabetic and this one didn't show any of the signs i was shocked so they ran some more tests and loaded me up with insulin and never cleaned his teeth. My bill was just about all of the $400 i had desperately saved. Every time i gave the cat insulin his sugar would crash. I ended up going to a different vet (BLUE CROSS animal hospital) who eventually did the surgery and said that his mouth was causing his diabetes and he just needed it done. I suspect  Ingleside purposely ran my bill up and didn't treat my animal because of past disputes. I have no proof but I will never pass on a chance to warn other cat owners to avoid them I will never return there and am so much happier with BCAC. I live in tempe now but will gladly drive to BCAC.!ref!1
My girlfriend and I wanted a weekend getaway.  We found the Royal Palms Resort and gave it a try.  It was a little pricey!ref!5
This place is dirty.  The plate my food was served on was dirty!ref!1
Meh..not particularly memorable.I've eaten at this location and the one by ASU!ref!3
Really mediocre!ref!1
Unimpressed and disappointed. There is nothing to these sandwiches. There are so many other places to get better sandwiches. Will not be returning.!ref!2
I've been here a couple times... very dive-y.  There is a very specific crowd of regulars here that know everybody. The girls are ok. (sorry ladies)  There is a wide variety of types of ladies there... tall!ref!3
It's a little overrated - but as another reviewer wrote!ref!3
One of my favorite places to grab a quick bit!ref!5
Went here for lunch Saturday afternoon with a party of 4.  I've been here about a zillion times yet this is my first review.I really hate going here but I love to eat here.  Let me explain:  The parking situation is a complete clusterfuq as is the ordering and seating process.  It is basically a yuppy free-for-all in the place.  The place where the line forms is full of stupid bric-a-brack and chatzkies.  All that crap should be removed for more seating and hopefully a less cluttered area.  Aside from that!ref!4
Parking SUCKS.Everything is over priced. It took me 25 minutes to get a cup of coffee!ref!3
Went there the next day and had the chicken salad sandwich which was superb.  The people are friendly and attentive.!ref!4
I stop for their great coffee every morning -- and only drive by when I can't manage to get a parking spot.  LGO also has really great unique gifts that have come in handy for Mother's Day!ref!4
Yum!Cute!ref!4
We're regulars at LGO. Amazing desserts!ref!4
this place is amazing!  everything is made to order and they have fantastic breakfast dishes and a great selection of bread!ref!5
Wow this place is awesome and very cool vibeI had the commuter sandwich with avocado to die for My wife loved her ham and kale quiche Kids can't get enough of the fruit parfait Wish I could have breakfast here everydayHas a line but moves very quickly!ref!5
Wow. Completely disappointed. I had the commuter. When did English muffins lose their crispness!ref!1
Ok!ref!2
Overly priced :/ they do not clean under nails. Very nice workers though. Great customer service. ;)!ref!3
Another of my favorite winebars (which is hundreds of miles away). I used to hang out with work friends for \""happy hour\""; the great part is we would drink and talk for hours and never once felt rushed to empty the table. My absolute favorite dish is their caprese sandwich and potato soup...the potato soup is cream!ref!5
Imagine if you took an Italian deli and dressed it up and put the sandwhiches on menus instead of a chalkboard and provided mood lighting and had a metrosexual waitstaff bring the sandwhiches to your table.  That's essentially Postino in a nutshell.  It's next to the ever trendy La Grande Orange which just adds to its hype.  Seriously!ref!3
Decided to try this place out after hearing how great it is from both the reviews on here and from word of mouth. It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you can't go wrong with any food consisting of bread!ref!4
OK. I realize that I look like a huge softy with the stars but I really do love postinos. My world revolves around their bruschetta. I mean!ref!4
My wife and her friends have raved about Postino and I finally had my chance to take in Postino a few days ago. The bruschetta is excellent. I had a hard time determining which was my favorite!ref!5
I may be alone in this!ref!5
I loved Postino's. Loved!ref!2
I LOVE this place!  My sister jokes that the only reason she comes to visit me in Arizona is for Postino's!!ref!5
I can see why people are just packing it in here. A great place for visitors and locals.Wonderful atmosphere. Quality wines and great gnoshing dishes. There is a friendly!ref!5
I really enjoy this place! From the eclectic beer and wine list to the amazing staff and good tunes!ref!5
Came here with some girlfriends for an afternoon bite/happy hour. I'm from Minnesota. Happy hour seven days a week is unheard of. What a deal. Especially with $5 glasses of wine! Any single one on the menu. The bruschetta is amazing--recommend the apples and goat cheese. De-lish!Service could be toned down somewhat; very helpful but maybe a little TOO helpful.!ref!5
Really great atmosphere!ref!3
I have only gone to Postino during the Monday/Tuesday $20 nights where you get a bottle of wine and choice of 3 bruschettas for the cheap price of $20.  I always order a bottle of moscato d'asti and a trio of Brie & Apples with fig!ref!5
This place always has a fun vibe and a great patio. Love meeting girlfriends here for wine and bruschetta.  Good service and nice atmosphere!ref!4
went here to celebrate an interview my wife went to.Had wine. Thats about it. Love going to sit and relax and have a glass of wine (or beer). They try and keep their atmospheres similar between the one on central and here.This one feels more condesnsed than the one on central. Obviously i prefer centrals location and atmosphere better.Food is the same at both places.!ref!3
This place is amazing! Location is easy to get to and valet is Perfect! It's free and I didn't mind paying a few bucks for the convenience! The food is great! Came here for a brunch with some girlfriends on a Saturday morning! They were willing to give us a nice comfy couch area for our group of 6-7. We all got mimosas and our server offered to just grab us a bottle since it would be the same price ($5/each). Yum! I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again. I hear they have deals on Monday and Tuesday nights for wine and bruschetta!!ref!5
Not good!ref!1
I am such a fan of this place. Husband  (who is more fried food and french fries sort of guy ) took me as a surprise for a date night. WHOLY AWESOMENESS.  Great GREAT brushetta (Even the husband liked it) and a great wine menu. I think I ordered everything that was remotely vegetarian. DELICIOUS. Seriously. I hear there is one in my neck of the woods (Ahwatukee).. can't wait to visit.!ref!5
Why the hell does everyone have stuffed animals?!Apparently!ref!3
This place is the dive bar of grocery stores. Congrats Fry's! You popped my 1-star cherry.It is only due to my current boycott of Target that I brought my business to the Fry's next door. This decision was based on principal!ref!1

I came here for the second time last night.  Audrey W and I met Amy B for dinner.I opted for the special and kind of regret it.  It was a seafood paella.  I have to remind myself sometimes that I don't live by the ocean anymore and very few restaurants here in the valley provide good quality seafood dishes along the lines of the paella.It was mediocre and I know many other things I have had at Havana Cafe are much better.:-( I'll just have to bank on my upcoming dinner at Wildfish for Restaurant Week to set me right.  I'm having the cioppino.I used to order things like cioppino or \""Fruite de Mare\"" all the time when I lived in Boston and I always enjoyed it.  Two times ordering that sort of thing at restaurants in Phoenix and :-(  Lesson learned.!ref!3
I have never written a review!ref!2
We usually go to the one on Bell Rd in N. Scottsdale but were in the area so tried this second location. I again had the Berenjena con Garbanzo!ref!3
I have to say!ref!2
I came to the Phoenix location for lunch through Groupon.  I ordered the beef brisket called Ropa Vieja!ref!2
The food here was good! I had chorizo with scrambled eggs. It was good although I wished I had gotten the carne asada; that is one of my favorites.My friend and I saw some characters at this place. I think they come out late at night.1) A couple walked in and the lady yelled \""ya'll busy\"" - if she looked!ref!3
Excellent Neighborhood ShitHole ! Consistently inconsistent!ref!2
After searching every nursery we could for 36\"" rose trees this late in the season we found out that Berridge was one of the only that still had them and they had a lot. When I got to the nursery I really like the layout of the plants.  There are also large trees on the grounds that provide nice shade while you are shopping.  I purchased 5 Hybrid-T 36\"" Rose Trees that were listed as \""Firefighter\"" as the color.  There were a couple that did not have flowers on them so there was no way of verifying the color.  Berridge offers a 90 day warranty on these plants!ref!4
Not bad!ref!3
I really want this place to be good.  I love seafood and it's only 2 or 3 blocks from where I live.  I've been twice now!ref!2
Oh. My. Damn!  I effing love this place!  I've been a lot and have always had great food and good service.  The oysters are a must have app!ref!5

Pushing the boundary of the Chinese buffet.Generally I'll visit an establishment at least three times prior to writing a review.  A second or third visit to Mike Kwan's Gold Coin would be of surprise to me. CASH ONLY!ref!2
Its a pretty nondescript dive.  Its basically a hallway!ref!3
In short!ref!4
A trifecta of goodness - service!ref!4
It's about time that I write a review for La Fontanella given that I've become a regular.  And I live in New York City.  That an Italian restaurant nearly across the country would not only win over my stomach but my heart is a major deal given that I come from the world of great Italian cuisine.  That all being said!ref!5
I went here with a party of 6 on Saturday night.  Our table was ready and waiting when we got there which was nice.  It is an older place with tons of charm.  The place was pretty busy and you could tell that the waiters/servers/busers were clearly over worked.After sitting for about 10 minutes we had to flag someone down to get bread and place our appetizer order.  After that we only saw our waiter every 20 minutes or so so it was difficult to order additional items or to get soda refills.The service was pretty blah but the food was excellent.  Everything I tried was top notch.  Everything was freshly made and delicious  Probably some of the best Italian cuisine around.  Definitely some of the best gnocchi I've ever had.I would definitely return but hope the service is better.!ref!4
I don't know that I would have gotten oil changes for a few years if it hadn't been for this place.  One stop shopping for getting an oil change and car wash - and there's a Wendy's right next door to grab some grub while they mess with the car.  They've expanded their offerings recently and now they do things from replacing your headlights to changing out belts.  My last trip there was an oil change!ref!3
This place is awful!!!!! I've been going to Firestone for yrs all over Arizona. Never ever had an issue until this location!!! Messed up my appts 3 times in one week. I've been here a total of 4 times this week!! Refused to top off all my fluids. Never heard of this before. It's your job!!!! When asking for my keys back!ref!1
I wish I could give zero stars! I should have known better to come back after I was misquoted the price for fluff and fold my first visit here!ref!1
Do you like sliders?Yup!ref!5
My buddy took me to this place!ref!3
1/3 cheddar burger with all toppings.  You wish more places and owner/operators existed like this.!ref!5
The food was great!ref!1
Where has this place been all my life?Best burger on this side of town. I'd recommend the full-size burgers over the sliders!ref!5
They quoted me 15 minutes!ref!4
Early on a hot Saturday morning!ref!5
I purchased a Banana Tree from Baker's on 06/15/2014.  It wasn't in very good condition to begin with and they only had 2 others.  The salesperson indicated that if it didn't do well that I could bring it back.  On 7/29/2014 I took the plant back in the pot it came in and with the receipt.  Baker's refused to give me another Banana Plant!ref!1
Bakers Nursery is where I've spent the majority of my weekend mornings.  I've either been pointed to a needed plant!ref!5
Best Thai in town. I've been eating here since 1994 or so.!ref!5
Absolutely the best red curry in history.  Wife loved the brocoly chicken.  I live in Idaho and there are only 2 restaurants in Phoenix I go out of my way for.  Thai lahna is one of them..!ref!5
I have tried this place 4 times. The food is not very good. I have lived in Thai Land but don't expect to get the same excellent food here. I love Thai food and Thai people!ref!1
Stopped in here on a whim as I was passing by and hungry!ref!3
Perfect on the drop off of rented tables and chairs but when it came to pick up on the Monday morning absolutely useless. My wife and I took a day off work with the plan that we would go out for the day once these people had picked up but when I hadn't heard from them by 11.40 I decided to call. The response was we are running behind schedule because Monday's are always busy but we should be there in another couple of hours so there goes our vacation day wasted. I would not recommend this company.!ref!1
The owner was so rude I walked out! And they only accept cash and the only reason I gave them a star is because the review made me! I mean this guy was ridiculous! I never had anyone greet me at the door like that!!!ref!1
I do not recommend.!ref!1
Down-home live music dive that's family owned and offers a great value for the money. Cheap drinks!ref!5
After spending a month shopping around Phoenix for a new sofa!ref!3
Pruitts was just ok. The place is a little trashed. The prices were ok but not as aggressive as they used to be. The service wasn't very good either granted it is a furniture store though.!ref!2
Pruitts asked me to email them to allow them an opportunity to make it right. So i did. Haven't heard anything else back.!ref!2
I have to agree with Patti B. that this location pretty much sucks.  The service is just ok - they are far from friendly.  I've been in  a couple of times to pick up food and I have yet to be impressed.  I wanted to give them another chance tonight and I should not have bothered.  The food is not so good.  I'd rather go to Pita Jungle or Thai Llana any day!  The spring rolls are greasy and room temperature and the tofu is pretty nasty.  I had some kind of udon noodle dish and threw most of it in the garbage.  Use your 'free entree' coupon to save $$ one night!ref!2
I've tried and tried to find something I like at these restaurants and I just can't come up with a reason to go back. I tried the Lo Mein with chicken. It smelled good but!ref!2
Chef cooking in the open facility. Mostly noodles. Pad Thai noodles!ref!3
Great service!ref!5
Came in to get my a Fossil watch repaired that belonged to my uncle.  The store owner/watchmaker was very friendly and let me in even though it was 5 minutes to closing time. He took one look at my watch!ref!5
Replaced my watch battery and fixed the inside of another watch for $5 a piece. Super cheap considering the ones in the mall quoted me like $25+ to replace one battery. I was so impressed at how quick & nice the gentlemen was who works there.  He even added a diamond stud that had fallen out for free!ref!5
Pros: Consistent quality. I like the pepperoni pizzone and my sister likes the Hershey chocolate sticks. Cons: Why would I bother to place my order online hours in advance!ref!1
I buy all of my tires at Discount Tire and my recent experience here just reminded me why. I noticed on Saturday morning that I had a nail stuck in the sidewall of my tire and decided that before waking up on Monday morning with a flat I'd better get it taken care of right away. Because the nail was in the sidewall!ref!5
Went there for an oil change recently.  Didn't know if there's going to be a wait time so I called ahead and make an appointment.  In and out of the store in under 30 minutes.  Great service and friendly staffs.!ref!4
The food at Little Shanghai is plentiful and reasonably priced.  The architecture and ambiance is a little dated but still has a high level of authenticity that is fitting and functional.  I haven't been to a better chinese restaurant in Phoenix.  The house chicken is to crave for late at night in your  refrigerator.  The sizzling beef should be a little more dangerous!ref!5
Food is good but I was told I could not have a refill on my soda... Completely turned off by this. You charge me $2 for a soda and will not give 1 refill? Shame!!ref!3
The shrimp fried rice and teriyaki chicken were good!ref!2
The only place I'll ever go when I need a seasonal faux tan. My visits typically take 45 minutes--15 to tan!ref!4
Not terrible food!ref!2
Some of the best Italian food I have ever had. This is a favorite for my wife and I. Sima and Marcellino are very nice people!ref!5
Maybe the only place in AZ that makes their own pasta? 5 stars by Arizona standards!ref!4
The experience at Marcellino Ristorante is perfect and I love their new location in Scottsdale!!ref!5
Over rated and over priced. I've been here a number of times and never been impressed with any of the specials or their homemade pastas either. Every time I left however!ref!2
Went to Marcellino with a large dinging group (about 18 people).  We were seated promptly even though we didn't have a reservation.  Our waiter was very good about keeping all of our orders separate!ref!4
I ate at Tutti Santi while in Phoenix for a business conference.  Met up with a co-workers father-in-law who happened to be in town and he suggested Tutti Santi!ref!3
Food ranges from delicious (elegant and lovely beef carpaccio) to mediocre (bland chicken rollatini and what might as well have been frozen vegetables).  The servers are lovely and attentive!ref!2
It's simple............. I don't believe I've given 5-stars to an Italian restaurant since Yelping!ref!5
I live nowhere near here (thank God!) but have had their donuts from co-workers bringing them in and have been in store. I recently tried the Texas kolache!ref!4
I was really irritated with this place.  I called up prior to heading over for a problem with my wife to check on ER wait times.  The woman on the phone was extermely rude.  She told me she could not give me that kind of information.  When I followed up with 'Is there alot of people waiting?' I received the same answer!ref!2
It's better than nothing. If you work in the area (16th and Morton) and have a limited amount of time for lunch!ref!2
It was my boyfriends birthday and we were trying to find a new pizza place worthy of us not going to oreganos anymore. And after reading all these reviews!ref!1
I have had this in my \""to try\"" list for a long time... not really long enough :(I stopped in for a lunch special...2 slices and a drink for like $4.00 or so... BUT they only accept debit over $5.00 Then make the damn special $5 bucks! I had to add a third slice just so I could eat there. LAMEThe pizza was thin!ref!2
I hadn't tried Pat's in a while so my boyfriend and I decided to order it this last Saturday night. Unfortunately!ref!1
My wife went into to pick up some chemicals that our pool need and was mistreated and harassed because she had the nerve to pay with a debit card for a very small purchase.  Are you kidding me? I have spent hundreds of dollars at this store.I understand the costs businesses incur when running things as debit/credit!ref!1
I have been to Mary for facials seeking clear skin for 9 years.  Yes my skin looks great.  She always has the latest and best products and treatments.  Mary 's salon is always a place of welcome and relaxation.  She takes time to evaluate my skin each session.!ref!5
I'm torn. They have great deals at times!ref!2
No matter how many times they call (nearly every day for the last few months!) and no matter how many times I tell them I am not interested and to please STOP CALLING - they continue to harass - calls come in from 8am until 9pm.  Based on these business practices alone I will never use them.!ref!1
If your are looking for any kind of flavor in your food!ref!1

I come to Carlos O'Briens periodically - maybe annually!ref!3
I went there recently and in the past it used to be my go to place. Sadly the food is not what it used to be and I no longer crave their chimichangas anymore. As for the Drinks yes these Margaritas are one of the best might just go for happy hour for now on.!ref!2
Was my 1st time at Carlos O'Brien's!ref!2
My husband took me to dinner here once. For such a big venue it was extremely empty. Once the food arrived I knew why. The food was so bland. I could have made dinner that night for way cheaper.!ref!2
here for happy hour on the patio 1st strike was the lipstick on my draft beer glass. 2nd was the the very rude server who treated our group like we came to dine and dash... the good points the chicken fundio and them accommodating my friends lap dog on their patio. good food bad service. yo Pancho stop being an ass no tip for you buddy.!ref!2
Great pizza it is; Chicago-style it is NOT.  Seems strange to me that Chicagoans claim this as \""Chicago Style\"" pizza.  Oh well - moving on.Their sausage is some of the best I've had outside of Chicago - without question.  The pizza is great - topping selection is great - the crust is good and I love their sweet marinara.  The service is sometimes lacking... it can be slow and inattentive.!ref!4
I tried this place because of all the wonderful reviews.  I have to say I was extremely disappointed. I ordered the mama signature pizza and a dinner salad. The salad is something I would expect from a lousy fast food place.  The pizza was flavorless and the crust was just a soggy mush.  I will not be eating her again.!ref!1
I love this place! I've been eating pizza from Spinato's for about five years now! And I've been to them all (this one!ref!5
We were originally driving out to Glendale to find another pizza place!ref!4
A great place to find utilitarian beauty items - need a cuticle clipper? specialty hair dyes? nail buffers? Designed for beauty professionals!ref!3
The store is supposed to open at 9am and the lady in the store seemed crabby and put out that she had to unlock the door at 9:05. She walked over flipped the lock and walked away in a huff. I was there for 15 minutes and she didn't even say hello!!ref!2
I have been going here for the past 10 years after getting one too many Great Clip haircuts. I haven't had a bad haircut since I've been going here. A vast majority of the people that work here are mainstays!ref!5

Karen did the flowers!ref!4
The tellers are really nice and helpful and there's rarely that long of a wait.  The thing that I have noticed specifically about this one is that when I want to make a cash deposit at their ATM's!ref!3
You get what you pay for. I may as well have let my kids paint my toenails. Not to mention the tech was rough and cut/pinched several of my toes during my pedicure.   Not impressed. I definitely won't be back.!ref!1

Had Dad's catering at a Christmas party I attended and even for free food I felt ripped off. I would have brought a lunch that day if I knew that I would be eating canned green beans!ref!2
Stayed at the hotel for 4 days. We ate breakfast here everyday and one dinner. The dinner left a lot to be desired. I ordered filet medium and it came out all red not medium. Waitress blamed it on st. Pats day specials. My daughter ordered a pasta and vegetable dish being vegan with oil on the side. It came all mixed together not on side.  Short order cook who does all eggs was fantastic! My wie ordered eggs benedict from kitchen rather tan wait in line for cooked to order.  They were just warm. This place needs to do a better job!!ref!2
While the staff was excellent!ref!3

My boyfriend and I went out on a thursday night for a last valentines day celebration at DPOV. Everything started off nice and were really enjoying the view and each other... The place started getting busier and our team of servers began stopping by less and less... By the time we had gotten our entrees they were pretty much nonexistent. Our food was just above Luke warm and our wine was empty.... After about 30 mins of waiting for some one to come over one of our servers came by to clear our plates. He didn't ask how our food was and didn't offer any dessert menus. We aren't really the complaining type but considering the price of the food my boyfriend got up to discuss our issues with the manager whom removed the entrees. This place really needs to improve their customer service skills. We decided to go to one of our favorite places for dessert. The  Rokerij. We won't return or recommend this place.!ref!2
Yet another Fantastic YELP ELITE EVENT....WOHOOO....let me spell it out for you:F.....for Fabulous FoodA.....for Awesome AtmosphereN....for Nostalgic NightlifeT.....for Tantalizing TidbitsA....for Awesome AmbienceS....for Superb ServiceT....for Tempting TreasuresI.....for Invigorating C.....for Complementary CuisineYes at A Different Pointe of View Restaurant all of the above can certainly be enjoyed however it's true value is the VIEW of the Valley of the Sun.....it is unmatched. The manager said if we could find a better view in Arizona....please let him know....well I don't know about the Entire state of Arizona....but as for the Valley maybe the view from the Wrigley mansion would come close.....but it can't touch the AWESOME VIEWS you can witness at A Different Pointe of View. Don't take my word for it....just try it for yourself and I think you will see things from a Different Pointe of View as well. Eat!ref!5
This restaurant is 5 stars for the view alone (which is what everyone else has mentioned)!ref!5
For a restaurant that supposedly prides itself on its five star service I was very disappointed. First off the waitress looked completely disheveled!ref!2

Dined here on 3/23 with a friend. We had reservations for 730 and quickly realized we should go earlier because we wanted to see the view with some light. So!ref!5

Italian hero was decent but probably wouldn't come back for it.  The pasta salad was old and some of the pasta was starting to get hard.  No bueno.  Overall I'd say they are coming up short in too many levels. If you want a real Italian deli go to Niccolis not too far from here.  They have one of the best sandwiches I've ever had!!ref!2
Very happy with ease of Christmas tree shopping. Beautiful backdrop. Cookies!ref!5
Overpriced and rude.. I wont give this place (or the asshole attendant) another cent of my money. There was a spot on my hood so I was using the squeegee to get it off (it was less then the size of a dime) when the attendant runs out and tells me to stop using the squeegee on my hood. His reasoning!ref!1
A great garage with a great owner.  George goes above and beyond to provide quality service!ref!5
I should give negative stars!! Went in for an oil change and trip check Friday April 25!ref!1

Got there on a Sat morning at 11am!ref!1

I am preparing to travel with small dog and need pricing for health certificate.  I called a few places....when I called here I was told \""no pricing over the phone\"".  What?  Are you kidding?  Not even for the document? How about price for office visit?  NO...she told me no pricing given for ANYTHING over the phone.  I suspect it is on the same lines as a restaurant with no pricing on the menu...I can't afford it.  This was the ONLY place that could not give me a price for a simple office visit or health certificate.!ref!1

Yet another bad experience with Arizona Federal Credit Union. This morning I placed an order with a company in Scotland for some clothing. (Yes!ref!1
If there were an option for 0 stars that's what I'd choose. This place should be shut down. Years ago I made the mistake of taking my puppy Lucy to get spayed here and from the get go the staff was very rude and acted as if they were put out answering any questions I had at all. Later that day I picked Lucy up and her incision looked like a giant sloppy wound you would see in a horror movie. When I asked about it they assured me it was fine and would not send home any pain meds for her. The next few days Lucy was in extreme pain wailing and crying all night which shouldn't be the case. I thought that experience was bad but nothing compared to my brother's. Just yesterday my brother took his puppy Leo here to get neutered when they picked Leo up he was bleeding everywhere. When they brought it to the vets attention they assured them that it's normal to stop worrying. So they took him home. Well the bleeding wasn't normal he kept bleeding profusely to the point that his scrotum was completly filled up with blood and swollen up huge. This is the point they took him to the emeegency pet clinic where they gasped and said it is definatly not normal. They kept Leo overnight and good thing. They said if he wasn't brought in there was a good chance he would have bled out overnight. They also informed him that they get quite a few emergencies that come in after going to this hack shop North Phoenix Spay and Neuter Clinic. So take it from me if you can avoid this place at all cost if your pet means anything to you. I will never step foot in this place again.!ref!1
We had a wonderful experience with them.  They were friendly!ref!5
The food tasted really good!ref!3
